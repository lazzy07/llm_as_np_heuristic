To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is already in PatientRoomA with Jones, the next logical step is to assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Ross is also a patient who needs attention, and understanding his condition will help Hathaway manage her workload effectively.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can admit Young to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to a room where he can be treated later.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for understanding what treatment Young may need.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing both Ross and Young, Hathaway will treat Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics. This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Next, Hathaway will treat Ross in the admissions room. Since Ross also has SymptomA, he will receive antibiotics as well, ensuring he becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young in Exam Room B. Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis, so he will receive steroids. This action is necessary for Young to become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, all patients will be treated correctly, and Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
