To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to take the coins from Tom. This action is necessary to reach Tom, who is carrying the coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is essential for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to return to a location where she can access the bandit camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.
