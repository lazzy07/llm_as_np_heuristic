**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing the urgency of the situation, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to gather information about the patients who are currently in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Ross will help Dr. Hathaway understand his condition and provide the appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - Assessing Young is also essential to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - If Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now manageable, he can accurately treat Jones.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.**  
   - If Ross has Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy. Again, with a manageable workload, Dr. Hathaway can accurately treat Ross.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics.**  
   - If Young has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. Dr. Hathaway can now accurately treat Young as well.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.

- The first four actions (walking and assessing) are necessary to gather information about the patients' conditions, which is critical for making accurate treatment decisions.
- The last three actions (treating) are essential to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment based on their assessed symptoms, leading to their recovery.
