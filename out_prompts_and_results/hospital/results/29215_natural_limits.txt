Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in Patient Room A and Patient Room B. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess both patients in the same room, Ross and Jones, to determine their symptoms.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** (This action allows Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** (This action allows Hathaway to identify Jones's symptoms as well, ensuring both patients are evaluated.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young, who is in Patient Room B.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action allows Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms.)

After assessing all three patients, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross has a fever (indicating Flaze), Jones has a rash (indicating Jarkis), and Young has a fever (indicating Flaze). 

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** (This action is necessary to treat Ross's Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids.** (This action is necessary to treat Jones's Jarkis, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics.** (This action is necessary to treat Young's Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

By treating all patients correctly, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
