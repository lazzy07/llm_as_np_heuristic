Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both feeling the tension of the dangerous environment around them. They have just made peace, but the threat of the volcano erupting looms over them. Zoe, wanting to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's, decides to take action.

Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, leaving the Lizard on the surface. This action makes the Lizard angry, as it feels abandoned and unsafe. However, Zoe's intention is to prepare for a potential eruption and to find a way to help the Lizard.

To achieve the Lizard's goal of being healthy and safe, Zoe quickly realizes she must return to the surface and make a plan together with the Lizard. 

Zoe teleports back to the surface, where the Lizard is waiting. This time, they can work together to find a safe place away from the volcano.
