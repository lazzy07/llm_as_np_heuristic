In this story, Talia's happiness and wealth are the primary goals. To achieve this, we need to ensure that Talia acquires the treasure, which will make her wealthy and potentially happy. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure in the cave.** (Rory is at the cave and can pick up the treasure, which is necessary for Talia to become wealthy.)
2. **Gargax eats Rory.** (Gargax is hungry and can eat Rory, which allows Gargax to become not hungry and also leaves the treasure unguarded.)
3. **Talia travels from the village to the cave and takes the treasure.** (Talia can now take the treasure that Rory had picked up, making her wealthy and thus achieving her goal of happiness.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Rory picks up the treasure:** This action is necessary because it allows the treasure to be in the cave, where Talia can later access it.
- **Gargax eats Rory:** This action is crucial as it removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to take the treasure without any opposition. It also satisfies Gargax's hunger.
- **Talia travels to the cave and takes the treasure:** This final action is what directly leads to Talia becoming wealthy, fulfilling her goal of happiness.
