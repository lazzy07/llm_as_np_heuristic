2. **Admit(Hathaway, Ross, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room C. This allows Hathaway to manage all patients effectively and ensures that Ross can also be assessed and treated. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

3. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), ExamRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. This action is crucial to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis. Assuming Young shows no symptoms, Hathaway believes Young is healthy.
