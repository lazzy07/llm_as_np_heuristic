In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is on the surface of the planet. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe, wanting to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard, decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to interact with the Lizard and address the situation on the planet. She needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to establish a connection and potentially make peace.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Since both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends, Zoe takes the initiative to approach the Lizard and express her desire for friendship. This action is crucial as it changes their relationship from negative to positive, allowing them to work together.

3. **The volcano erupts**: After Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, the volcano erupts. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting. 

4. **Zoe dies**: As a result of the eruption, Zoe is caught in the lava flow and perishes. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying in the story.

The story ends with the Lizard now being the sole guardian of the planet, having made a friend in Zoe, even if their friendship was short-lived due to the eruption.
