To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Jones, the first step is to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Jones's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should walk to PatientRoomC to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will make Jones healthy.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will make Young healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating both patients, Hathaway should walk to the Admissions room to check on Ross.

6. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure all patients are healthy.

7. **Treat Ross accordingly**: Depending on Ross's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate medication (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis).

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
