To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will leave the Camp and walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be in a location where she can interact with other characters, particularly Tom, who is at the Crossroads.

2. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk from the Camp to the Crossroads. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to be in the same location as the Merchant to potentially rob her.

3. **rob(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant of the MerchantSword. This action is necessary for the Bandit to acquire an item that can help her in future actions, but it also allows the Merchant to lose an item without losing any coins, keeping her from becoming a criminal.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk from the Crossroads to the Market. This action is necessary for the Merchant to return to her preferred location where she can sell items and potentially acquire more coins.

5. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the TomCoin from the Merchant using one of her coins. This action is necessary for the Merchant to increase her coin collection without becoming a criminal.

6. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for her to be in a position to interact with Tom again.

7. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to fulfill his goal of being at the Cottage carrying the medicine.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully acquired more coins without committing any crimes, thus achieving her goal.
