In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - flowers). Casey (C3) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I3 - jewelry), and Blake (C2) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2 - chocolates). 

To help Blake achieve their goal of happiness, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I2) they want with Casey for the jewelry (I3) that Casey wants. This action will make both Blake and Casey happy.

Here’s how the story unfolds:

- **Action**: trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)
  - Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. After this trade, Blake is happy because they now have the chocolates they wanted, and Casey is also happy because they now have the jewelry they wanted.

After this action, the happiness status is:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex still has flowers)
- happy(C2) = True (Blake now has chocolates)
- happy(C3) = True (Casey now has jewelry)

This single action achieves Blake's goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
