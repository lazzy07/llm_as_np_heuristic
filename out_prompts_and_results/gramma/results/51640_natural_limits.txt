The bandit, armed with both the merchant's sword and her own sword, decides to take action to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She approaches the merchant, who is currently at the market with the hero and the guard. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the hero's coin that the merchant has.

**Explanation of the action:**

**Final Story:**
The bandit, armed with her sword, approaches the merchant at the market and robs her of the hero's coin.
