**Story Completion:**

1. **The hero (Tom) attacks the bandit.**  
   - Tom uses the merchant's sword to attack the bandit, who is not armed with a sword. This action is necessary for Tom to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit and to reclaim his stolen coin.

2. **The bandit is killed.**  
   - The bandit is now dead, allowing Tom to loot her items without any risk of retaliation.

3. **The hero loots the banditâ€™s coin.**  
   - Tom takes the coin that the bandit had stolen from him. This action is crucial for Tom to regain his lost wealth.

4. **The hero walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - With the medicine and the coin now in his possession, Tom can finally return to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there while carrying the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (attacking the bandit) is essential because Tom needs to remove the bandit as a threat to secure his coin and ensure his safety.
- The second action (the bandit being killed) is a direct consequence of Tom's attack, allowing him to proceed without fear of being robbed again.
- The third action (looting the bandit) is necessary for Tom to recover what was taken from him, fulfilling his need for the coin.
- The final action (walking to the cottage) is the culmination of Tom's journey, as it brings him to his desired location with the medicine.
