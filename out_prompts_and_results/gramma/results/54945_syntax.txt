To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can acquire the medicine from the merchant's corpse and then walk to the cottage. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **loot(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: After attacking the merchant, Tom can loot the medicine from her corpse. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom then walks from the market to the crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the cottage.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action is necessary to reach his desired location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Looting the medicine**: This is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.
- **Walking to the crossroads**: This is a necessary step to transition from the market to the cottage.
- **Walking to the cottage**: This final step allows Tom to reach his goal location.
