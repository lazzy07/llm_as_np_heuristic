In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1), which is currently with Casey (C2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to obtain the jewelry. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve that:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the item they have (which is the chocolates, I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to get the item they want directly from Casey, fulfilling their desire for happiness.

The action sequence is as follows:

- **trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates they have for the jewelry that Casey has. After this trade, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:

- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey is now happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake remains unhappy as they still do not have the item they want, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, the story ends here.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
