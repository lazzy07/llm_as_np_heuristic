Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze due to the high workload. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is incorrect for the actual condition. However, since Young is alive and healthy, they recover from the treatment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Again, due to the workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross, like Young, recovers from the treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing Unknown. Mistakenly believing Jones has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. Jones also recovers.

In the end, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
