**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, stands on the highway, contemplating his next move. He knows that he must escape before the bully can find him or Roy. 

1. **Ernest decides to escape from the prison.** He takes a deep breath, glances back at the prison, and then runs down the highway, leaving the prison behind. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Ernest achieving his goal of being alive and free.

Meanwhile, back in the kitchen:

2. **Roy, still in the kitchen, realizes that the bully is angry and might come after him.** He quickly decides to hide the cigarettes in a safe place, knowing that they could be used against him. This action is necessary to protect himself from the bully's threats.

3. **Roy then moves to the hallway.** He needs to find a way to escape as well, but he is unaware of Ernest's successful escape. This action is important for Roy to stay safe and look for options.

4. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** He hopes to find a way to lock the bully in the gym, but he is also cautious about being caught. This action is strategic as it allows him to potentially trap the bully.

5. **Once in the gym, Roy locks the door behind him.** This action is essential to ensure that the bully cannot follow him and to give himself some time to think about his next move.

At this point, Ernest is already free, having successfully escaped the prison. Roy, while still in danger, has taken steps to protect himself from the bully.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's escape is the primary action that leads to him achieving his goal of being alive and free.
- Roy's actions of hiding the cigarettes and locking the gym door are defensive measures to protect himself from the bully, ensuring he remains alive.
