To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room. This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This is important for Casey to share their happiness with the others.

4. **tell(C3, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they have the jewelry. This action is included to communicate their success in obtaining what they wanted.

5. **tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey tells Alex that they have the jewelry. This reinforces Casey's happiness and allows Alex to feel good about Casey's success.
