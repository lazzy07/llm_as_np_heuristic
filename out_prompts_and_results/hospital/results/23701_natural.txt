**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A first. She walks into the room and assesses Jones, discovering that he has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze. This reduces her workload to 2.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. She admits Ross to Patient Room C, where he can be treated. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room C and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. She treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him. This reduces her workload to 1.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room B. She assesses Young in Patient Room B and finds that he also has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. She treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved her goal.
