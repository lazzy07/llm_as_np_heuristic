In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has just attacked the Merchant, who is now dead. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Merchant had the medicine and was armed, the Bandit can now loot the Merchant's corpse for the medicine and any coins she might have had.

The Bandit takes the following action:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the medicine. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having items in her possession, as it allows her to collect valuable items from the Merchant.

After this action, the Bandit has successfully looted the Merchant and can now carry the medicine, which contributes to her goal of having items.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible story where the Bandit achieves her goal by taking advantage of the situation after the attack on the Merchant.
