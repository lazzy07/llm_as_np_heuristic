To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market to confront Tom and the Merchant, where she can take advantage of the situation.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coin that the Merchant has. This action is possible because the Bandit is armed and the Merchant is not.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads, where she can access her camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit takes the coins she has acquired and places them in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to interact with the Merchant and Tom.
- By robbing the Merchant, the Bandit gains a coin without any risk of being attacked since the Merchant is unarmed.
- Returning to the Crossroads allows the Bandit to safely access her camp.
- Finally, placing the coins in the chest at the camp fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins secured.
