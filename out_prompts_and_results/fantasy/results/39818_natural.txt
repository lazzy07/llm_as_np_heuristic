To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince currently has the money but no treasure. By picking up the treasure, he will increase his wealth.

2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village to be with Talia and Rory, which will help him achieve happiness through companionship.

3. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant for the sake of the story. However, it can be interpreted as a reaffirmation of his commitment to Talia, which may contribute to his happiness.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**  
   - This action is also redundant since Talia is already married to Vince, but it reinforces their bond and contributes to Vince's happiness.

5. **Vince and Talia get married.**  
   - This action is unnecessary as they are already married, but it symbolizes their union and can be seen as a way to solidify their relationship.

6. **Vince becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to show that Vince's hunger state can change, but it does not affect his wealth or happiness directly.

7. **Vince eats to satisfy his hunger.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to ensure he is not hungry anymore, which is one of his goals.

After these actions, Vince will have the treasure, the money, and will not be hungry, thus achieving his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
