To ensure Casey achieves their goal of obtaining the jewelry, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows them to do so while also considering the desires of Alex and Blake. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Blake wants the chocolates, but they are currently in the dining room. By moving to the living room, Blake can assess the situation and potentially interact with Alex and Casey.

2. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - Blake sees the flowers that Casey put down earlier. Although Blake wants the chocolates, picking up the flowers allows them to have an item to trade later.

3. **Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Blake moves to the bathroom to find Casey, who is currently there. This allows for a potential trade or interaction.

4. **Blake gives the flowers to Casey.**  
   - Blake gives the flowers to Casey, who wants the jewelry. This action makes Blake happy because they have given away an item, and it also helps Casey get closer to their goal.

5. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - Casey, now holding the flowers, moves to the living room to find Alex. They give the flowers to Alex, who wants them. This makes Alex happy.

6. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.**  
   - With Alex now happy with the flowers, Casey takes the opportunity to pick up the jewelry that Alex had. This action fulfills Casey's goal of obtaining the jewelry.

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry, while Alex is happy with the flowers, and Blake has given away the flowers but is not yet happy since they still want the chocolates.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the exchange of items while ensuring that Casey ultimately gets the jewelry.
- The movement between rooms is necessary to allow characters to interact and trade items.
- Giving and picking up items are crucial for achieving the happiness of each character based on their desires.
