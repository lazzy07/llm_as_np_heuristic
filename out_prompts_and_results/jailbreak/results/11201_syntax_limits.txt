**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes. Roy is feeling threatened, and he wants to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison alive. 

Roy decides to take action. He crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he knows the bully is. Once inside the gym, he sees the bully distracted and seizes the opportunity. With the knife he stole earlier, Roy confronts the bully and kills him. This act eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest.
