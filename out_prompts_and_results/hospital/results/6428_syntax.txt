To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A. This is important to ensure that Ross's condition is also evaluated, as he may have either disease.

3. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated.

6. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This will ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.
