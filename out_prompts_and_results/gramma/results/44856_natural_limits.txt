The merchant, realizing the danger posed by the bandit, decides to take action to protect her interests. She walks from the bandit camp to the market, where she can confront the bandit directly. Upon arriving at the market, she sees the bandit and quickly reports the bandit's location to the guard, who is now dead but was previously at the market. This action is crucial because it alerts any remaining guards or nearby characters to the bandit's presence, potentially leading to the bandit's capture or death, which would allow the merchant to safely keep the coins she has without becoming a criminal.

The merchant's goal is to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, and by reporting the bandit, she distances herself from any criminal activity while also potentially benefiting from the chaos that ensues.
