Zoe stands on the surface, feeling the ground tremble beneath her feet as the volcano begins to rumble ominously. She knows she must act quickly to ensure her safety and to try to make a friend out of the Lizard, who is also in danger. 

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** This action is taken to close the distance between them and initiate a conversation, as Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** By choosing to make peace, Zoe expresses her desire to be friends rather than enemies, which aligns with both characters' goals of safety and friendship.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs as a natural consequence of the story's setting, creating a sense of urgency and danger for both characters.

4. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is taken to escape the eruption and ensure her safety, as she has successfully made peace with the Lizard and can leave without hostility.

In this story, the actions taken lead to the eruption of the volcano, which creates a dramatic climax. Zoe's decision to make peace with the Lizard allows them to avoid conflict, and her teleportation to the spaceship ensures her survival. The Lizard, remaining on the surface, unfortunately meets its demise in the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
