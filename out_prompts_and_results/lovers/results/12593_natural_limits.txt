In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since the chocolates are in the dining room, Blake needs to get them to be happy.

To achieve this, Blake can tell Casey that Alex wants the jewelry, which is a lie. This will prompt Casey to give the jewelry to Blake, allowing Blake to be happy with the jewelry. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** (This is a lie, but it manipulates Casey into thinking that giving the jewelry to Blake will make Alex happy.)
2. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.** (This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy with the jewelry.)

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry, while Alex and Casey remain unhappy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry:** This action is necessary for Blake to manipulate Casey into giving up the jewelry, which Blake wants.
- **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake:** This action directly results in Blake achieving their goal of happiness.
