To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Young without making a mistake. This will help determine Young's symptoms.
2. **Treat Young based on the assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Young is currently in the admissions room. They need to be in Exam Room B to be assessed by Hathaway.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms.
3. **treat(Hathaway, Young, TreatmentB, PatientRoomB)**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Young with the correct treatment.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to move Young to the exam room where Hathaway can assess them. It is essential for Hathaway to see all patients in their assigned rooms.
  
- **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: This action allows Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms accurately. Since Hathaway's workload is below 3, they will not make a mistake in diagnosing Young.

- **treat(Hathaway, Young, TreatmentB, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway can now treat them correctly based on the identified symptoms. This action is crucial for ensuring Young becomes healthy.

After these actions, all patients will be healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
