### Story Completion

After assessing Ross in Patient Room A, Hathaway realizes that Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze (a fever). However, due to Hathaway's current workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Ross immediately with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

Next, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones and Young, who are both waiting. Since Hathaway believes both patients are alive and healthy, they will need to be assessed to determine their symptoms. 

Hathaway assesses Jones and finds that he is also showing symptoms of Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy as well.

Finally, Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he is showing symptoms of Jarkis (a rash). Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
