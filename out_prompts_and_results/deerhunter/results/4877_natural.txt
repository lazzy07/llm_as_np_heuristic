Bubba is currently at the forest, hungry, and wants to have money. The clerk at the bank has 1 money, which is what Bubba desires. To achieve his goal, Bubba needs to take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - Since Bambi is not alive, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his goal of getting money.
