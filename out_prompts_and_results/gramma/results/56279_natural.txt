To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to confront the bandit and retrieve the coin that the merchant has, which he needs to buy a sword for protection.

2. **Tom buys a sword from the bandit by giving her the coin he has.**  
   - Tom needs a sword to defend himself against the bandit. The bandit is willing to sell a sword for a coin, which Tom can now provide.

3. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After acquiring the sword, Tom needs to return to the crossroads to prepare for his next move.

4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
