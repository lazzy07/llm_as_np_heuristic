To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is already at the Camp and will walk to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom and the Guard.

2. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk from the Camp to the Crossroads, where she can potentially interact with the Merchant and Tom.

3. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, will rob the Bandit, taking the BanditCoin. This action is necessary for the Merchant to increase her coin count without becoming a criminal, as the Bandit is a criminal and the Merchant is armed.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Bandit, the Merchant will walk back to the Camp to secure her coins and avoid any confrontation.

5. **take(Merchant, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant will take the BanditCoin and place it in the chest at the Camp. This action ensures that the coins are secured and counts towards her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.
