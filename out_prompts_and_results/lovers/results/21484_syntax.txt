To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with Blake and Alex later.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating a potential trade or interaction.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room. Now all three characters are in the same room, which is essential for the next actions.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

5. **put_down(C1, I3, R21)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I3) in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's happiness but can be seen as a way to clear space or signify that Alex is now happy with the flowers.

At this point, Alex has received the flowers and is happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Moving characters to the same room**: This is crucial for enabling interactions and exchanges between the characters.
- **Giving the flowers to Alex**: This is the key action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.
- **Putting down the chocolates**: While not necessary for achieving happiness, it can be seen as a way to signify that Alex has achieved their goal.
