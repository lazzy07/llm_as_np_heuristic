To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R22) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the bathroom. This action is essential as it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story and to keep Alex in a location where they can interact with the other characters if needed.

4. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves to the living room (R12) to check on Casey. This action is included to show Alex's concern for Casey's happiness, which is part of their character.

5. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they have the flowers. This action is included to communicate with Casey and show that Alex is thinking of them.

6. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is crucial because it not only makes Casey happy (since they want the flowers) but also fulfills Alex's desire to make Casey happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, and Casey is also happy because they received the flowers.
