To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the item they have (which is the flowers, I2) to Alex. This is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to trade.

3. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I2) they just received from Casey for the jewelry (I1) that Blake has. This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the room where they were initially. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1), which means Alex is happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact and receive items.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives Alex the flowers, which is a necessary step for Alex to have something to trade.
- **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: This is the crucial action where Alex trades the flowers for the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action is included for narrative continuity, allowing Alex to return to their previous location.
