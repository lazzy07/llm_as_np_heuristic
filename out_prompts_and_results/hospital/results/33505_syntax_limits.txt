**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, in Patient Room B, assesses Young, who is showing SymptomA (a fever). Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Young has a fever and correctly identifies it as Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones, who has not yet been assessed. Since Jones is in the admissions room, Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room C. 

Finally, Hathaway assesses Jones, who is showing no symptoms yet. However, since Jones has been admitted and is alive, Hathaway believes Jones is healthy and does not need treatment. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomA, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Young's condition and ensure the correct treatment is administered. 
2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: This action treats Young for Flaze, which is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: This action allows Hathaway to move to the admissions room to assess Jones, ensuring that all patients are evaluated and treated as needed.
