Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, assesses Young, who is also in Patient Room B. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates that Young has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Young becomes healthy.
