To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy with the item they have (I3). Blake (C2) is also not happy, as they want the chocolates (I2), which are currently in the bathroom (R21).

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the bathroom to access the chocolates (I2).
   - This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom.
   - This action allows Alex to have an item that can be used to negotiate with Blake.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Blake and Casey are.
   - This action is necessary to interact with Blake, who is in the same room.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake.
   - This action makes Blake happy, as they wanted the chocolates.

5. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) with Alex for the chocolates (I2).
   - This action allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex has the jewelry (I1) and is happy, achieving their goal.
