**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room B, assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds anyway. She mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the high workload and the unknown symptoms. She treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect since Ross actually has Flaze. As a result, Ross dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C. She then assesses Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. She assesses Young and, despite her workload still being high, correctly identifies that Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young also becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones and Young, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
