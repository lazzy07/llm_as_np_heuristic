To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to navigate through the locations while avoiding conflict with the guard and the bandit. Here’s the completed story:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. This action is necessary for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage.

The story is very short because Tom already has the medicine in his possession after buying it at the Crossroads. He simply needs to walk to the Cottage to fulfill his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it directly leads Tom to his goal location, the cottage, while carrying the medicine he purchased earlier.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal efficiently.
