Zoe, the space explorer, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and is in danger. She decides to teleport down to the surface to meet the Lizard and make peace. 

1. **Action: teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to approach the Lizard. This action is necessary for her to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing her to interact with him directly.

2. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Once on the surface, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it helps both characters achieve their goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.

By making peace, Zoe ensures that both she and the Lizard can work together to stay safe on the dangerous surface of the planet.
