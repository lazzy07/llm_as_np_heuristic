To achieve Blake's goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to have an item to trade with Casey, who wants the jewelry.

2. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - By giving the jewelry to Casey, Blake can fulfill Casey's desire, which may lead to a trade or a favor in return.

3. **Casey gives chocolates to Blake.**  
   - Since Casey now has the jewelry, they can give the chocolates to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire for chocolates.

4. **Blake is now happy.**  
   - Blake has achieved their goal of obtaining the chocolates, making them happy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake gets what they want while also considering the desires of the other characters.
