To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, is hungry, and has a rifle and ammunition. The bank clerk has money, and Bubba is greedy, which means he wants to take the clerk's money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Load the rifle with ammunition**: This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to intimidate the bank clerk and to steal the money. 
   - Action: `load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)`

2. **Steal the money from the bank clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now threaten the clerk and take the money.
   - Action: `steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)`

3. **Decide to eat**: After stealing the money, Bubba is still hungry, so he decides to eat.
   - Action: `decide_to_eat(Bubba)`

4. **Go to the forest**: Bubba needs to go to the forest where Bambi is located to potentially eat.
   - Action: `go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)`

5. **Shoot Bambi**: Since Bubba is hungry and wants to eat, he will shoot Bambi to obtain food.
   - Action: `shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)`

6. **Eat Bambi**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
   - Action: `eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)`

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Load the rifle**: Necessary for the theft.
2. **Steal the money**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
3. **Decide to eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger.
4. **Go to the forest**: Moves to where he can find food.
5. **Shoot Bambi**: Acquires food by killing Bambi.
6. **Eat Bambi**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
