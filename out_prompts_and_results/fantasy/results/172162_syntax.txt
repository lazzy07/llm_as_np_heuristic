To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia is currently in the cave and can pick up the treasure. This action is necessary for her to increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the treasure, Talia will travel back to the village. This is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as Rory to complete her relationship goal.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia will marry Rory. Since Rory has already accepted her proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory will become hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger is acknowledged, even though it does not directly affect Talia's goals.

5. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia will also become hungry. This action is included for consistency, as both characters are now aware of their hunger status.

By following these actions, Talia will achieve her goals of happiness and wealth.
