**Story Completion:**

After stealing the civilian clothes from the laundry, Ernest finds himself on the highway, disguised and ready to escape. He knows that Roy is still in the laundry, and the bully is in the gym, posing a threat to both of them. 

Ernest decides to take action to ensure both he and Roy can escape safely. He knows that Roy has the pack of cigarettes, which the bully wants. To protect Roy, Ernest quickly crawls back through the vents to the laundry room.

Once in the laundry room, Ernest finds Roy and warns him about the bully's intentions. They both realize that they need to act fast. Ernest tells Roy to keep the cigarettes hidden and suggests they both put on the civilian clothes to disguise themselves.
