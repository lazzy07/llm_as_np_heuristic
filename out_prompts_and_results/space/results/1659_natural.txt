Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are enemies. To achieve a resolution, Zoe needs to make peace with the Lizard, while the Lizard must also be willing to become friends. The surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, which adds urgency to their situation.

1. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation. Since they are both at the cave, this action allows them to interact directly.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to transition from being enemies to friends. They both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends, so this aligns with their goals.

3. **The volcano erupts**: This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting. Since the surface is already dangerous, the eruption serves as a dramatic conclusion to the story, emphasizing the urgency of their newfound friendship and the need for cooperation.

The sequence of actions leads to a resolution where Zoe and the Lizard become friends, and the eruption serves as a reminder of the dangers they face, reinforcing their bond.
