To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. Talia also needs to acquire wealth, which she can do by taking the treasure from Rory. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels to the Village to be with Vince, who is currently there. This is necessary for her to solidify her relationship with Vince and to propose marriage.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action makes both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

3. **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Talia takes the treasure from Rory, who is in the Cave. This action allows Talia to become wealthy, as she now possesses the treasure.

With these actions, Talia achieves her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia needs to be with Vince to marry him, so she travels to the Village.
- **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage.
