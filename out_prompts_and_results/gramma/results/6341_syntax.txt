To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coins he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then retrieves the coins from her camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action is taken to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, which is one of her goals.
