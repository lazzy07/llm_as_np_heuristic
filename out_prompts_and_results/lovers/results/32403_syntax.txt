To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21) to be closer to Alex and Blake.
2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item, which may help in the next steps.
3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R21) to the bathroom (R22) to retrieve the flowers (I1).
4. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Blake picks up the flowers (I1) in the bathroom (R22).
5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R21) with the flowers.
6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). This action ensures that Alex receives the item they want, making them happy.
