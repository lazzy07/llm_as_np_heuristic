To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially obtain money indirectly by using the rifle.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the Forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which is a step towards fulfilling his greed for money, as he can then take Bambi's body to eat or use it as leverage.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary because it satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a priority for him.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will return to the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to be back in the location where the Clerk is, allowing him to confront the Clerk.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba will steal the money from the Clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

By following these actions, Bubba successfully satisfies his greed and hunger while achieving his goal of obtaining money.
