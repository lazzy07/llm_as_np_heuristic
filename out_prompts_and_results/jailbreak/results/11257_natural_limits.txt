**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison comes to a close, Ernest, still in the kitchen, contemplates his next move. He knows that the bully is a threat, and with Roy having stolen the cigarettes, they are both in danger. 

1. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** This action is crucial because it allows Roy to disguise himself and prepare for an escape. He knows that if he can get outside, he can avoid the bully's threats and potentially find safety.

2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** This action is necessary for Roy to escape the prison without being detected by the bully or the guards. The highway represents freedom, and by moving through the vents, he avoids confrontation.

3. **Roy escapes from the prison.** This final action is the culmination of Roy's plan. By successfully escaping while disguised, he overcomes the bully's threats and secures his life outside the prison walls.
