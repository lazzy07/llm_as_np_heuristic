In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (flowers) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with I3 (jewelry). Blake (C2) wants I2 (chocolates) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex can trade the flowers (I1) they want with Blake for the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action is necessary because it allows both Alex and Blake to achieve their happiness simultaneously. After this trade, Alex will have the flowers they wanted, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) will also be happy because they will have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the jewelry (I3).

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
