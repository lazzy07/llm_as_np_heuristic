To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to go to the bank.** (Bubba wants to get money, and the bank is where the clerk has the money.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (This action takes Bubba to the location where he can confront the clerk.)
3. **Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to take the money.)
4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money that the clerk had.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Deciding to go to the bank**: This is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.
- **Going from the forest to the bank**: This action physically moves Bubba to the bank, where he can interact with the clerk.
- **Shooting the bank clerk**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, thus enabling Bubba to take the money.
- **Picking up the money from the clerk**: This final action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.
