**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room A. She knows she needs to assess her patients to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. She believes Ross is alive and healthy, but she needs to confirm his symptoms. 
   - **Reason**: This action is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide her treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is also waiting to be seen. 
   - **Reason**: Young is another patient who needs to be assessed to ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: After assessing, Hathaway determines that Ross has a fever (symptom of Flaze) and treats him with antibiotics. 
   - **Reason**: This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has a rash (symptom of Jarkis). 
   - **Reason**: This action is necessary to ensure Young's health, as he also needs the correct treatment.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
