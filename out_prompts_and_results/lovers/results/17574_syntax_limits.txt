In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (flowers) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the item I3 (jewelry). Blake (C2) wants the item I2 (chocolates) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex can trade the flowers (I1) they picked up with Casey for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (flowers) while also ensuring that Casey remains happy with the jewelry they desire.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey will still be happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake will remain unhappy because they still do not have the chocolates (I2), but this does not affect Alex's goal.

Thus, the story can be completed with this single action.

- **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: This action allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they want. It also keeps Casey happy, which aligns with both Alex's and Casey's desires.
