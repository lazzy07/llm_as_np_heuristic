To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomA, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This is crucial for ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is in PatientRoomC. This will help determine Ross's symptoms and allow for the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Young to an exam room (let's say PatientRoomB) and then assess him to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This is essential for ensuring Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly and achieve their goal of making them healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is necessary to identify the symptoms of each patient, which is critical for determining the correct treatment.
- **Treating patients**: This is the final step to ensure that each patient receives the appropriate care based on their symptoms, leading to their recovery.
