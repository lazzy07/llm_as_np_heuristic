To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the market, so she will walk to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is unarmed and carrying coins. This action allows the bandit to take the coins from Tom, increasing her total.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, further increasing her total coins.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for the bandit to move to a location where she can interact with Tom, who is carrying coins.
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: This action allows the bandit to take coins from Tom, which directly contributes to her goal of accumulating coins.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the bandit to retrieve coins from her camp, maximizing her total coin count.
