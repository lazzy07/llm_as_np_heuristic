Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on him without increasing her workload significantly. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. She discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand what treatment Jones needs.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated in the future, contributing to the overall goal of patient health.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This action is also necessary to prepare for Young's assessment and treatment, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and can receive care.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring he is healthy, and sets up Ross and Young for future assessments and treatments.
