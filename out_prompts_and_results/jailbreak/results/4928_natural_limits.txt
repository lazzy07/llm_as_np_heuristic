**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take a risk. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to protect himself and Ernest from the bully. He sneaks into the kitchen, grabs the knife, and then quickly returns to the hallway. 

With the knife in hand, Roy realizes that he can now confront the bully. He locks the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot escape and threatens them anymore. 

Now, with the bully locked in the gym, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can escape from the prison.
