1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help him, as she wants to make friends and ensure both of them are safe.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendship. Zoe's goal is to make friends, and the Lizard also desires companionship.

As they work together to find shelter from the volcanic eruptions, the volcano suddenly erupts, causing chaos around them.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is necessary to fulfill the condition of the story where the volcano erupts, leading to a character's demise.

4. **The Lizard dies.** - This action concludes the story with a character dying, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.
