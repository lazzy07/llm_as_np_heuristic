In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are present. Talia has the treasure, which she values for her happiness and wealth. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, she can leverage her relationships to achieve her goals. 

To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, she can take the following action:

1. **Talia gives the treasure to Gargax.** This action is taken because Gargax, being a dragon, values wealth and is not concerned about happiness. By giving the treasure to Gargax, Talia can negotiate with him for some of his wealth or favor, which could lead to her happiness or wealth.

This single action is sufficient to achieve Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, as it may lead to Gargax rewarding her in some way, thus fulfilling her desire for wealth.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Talia gives the treasure to Gargax:** This action is crucial because it directly addresses Talia's desire to be wealthy. By giving the treasure to Gargax, she may gain his favor or a share of his wealth, which aligns with her goal.
