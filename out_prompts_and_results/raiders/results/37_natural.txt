**Story Completion:**

After the Nazis open the Ark and die, their immortality allows them to rise again, but they realize they need to secure their position. They travel from Tanis to the USA, where they believe Indiana Jones is still present. The U.S. Army, unaware of the Nazis' resurrection, remains in the USA, believing they have the upper hand.

The Nazis, now immortal, confront Indiana Jones. They take the Ark from him by force, as they are armed and he is not. With the Ark in their possession, they travel back to Tanis, where they believe they can harness its power further.
