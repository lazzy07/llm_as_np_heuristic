Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of another patient. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload remains manageable.
