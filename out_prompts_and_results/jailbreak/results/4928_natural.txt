**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Ernest. 

1. **Roy moves to the kitchen.** (Roy needs to get the knife to protect himself and Ernest from the bully.)
2. **Roy steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to have a means of defense against the bully.)
3. **Roy returns to the hallway.** (Roy needs to be in a position to confront the bully or escape.)
4. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him safely.)
5. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to the hallway, put on the civilian clothes, and escape from the prison.

7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to escape without being recognized.)
8. **Roy goes to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's survival. The sequence of actions is designed to first neutralize the immediate threat (the bully) and then facilitate an escape from the prison. The locking of the gym door is a strategic move to ensure that the bully cannot retaliate while Roy prepares to confront him.
