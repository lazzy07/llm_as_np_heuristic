To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation indicates that no one is happy, and we need to facilitate the exchange of items to achieve this.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where Casey is located (R22) to interact with them.
   - **Reason**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to facilitate an item exchange.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake.
   - **Reason**: Casey is currently holding the jewelry and can give it to Blake, which will help Blake get closer to their goal.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R12).
   - **Reason**: Blake needs to be in the dining room to interact with Alex and facilitate the next exchange.

4. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they received from Casey for the chocolates (I2) with Alex.
   - **Reason**: This action allows Blake to obtain the chocolates, which is the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Blake will have the chocolates, making them happy.
