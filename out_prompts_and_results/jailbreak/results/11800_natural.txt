1. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (Ernest needs to find a way to protect himself and Roy from the bully. The gym is a location where he can confront the bully.)
   
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape and that he can confront him without outside interference.)

3. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (Ernest needs a weapon to defend himself and Roy against the bully. The knife is essential for this confrontation.)

4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Ernest and Roy's safety.)

5. **Ernest goes to the hallway.** (After dealing with the bully, Ernest needs to regroup and plan his next move.)

6. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (Disguising himself allows Ernest to escape without being recognized.)

7. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action takes him to the outside world, where he can finally be free.)

8. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise and the route taken, Ernest successfully leaves the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to help Ernest eliminate the threat of the bully and secure his escape. Moving to the gym allows for a confrontation, locking the door prevents the bully from escaping, retrieving the knife provides a means of defense, and ultimately killing the bully removes the immediate danger. The subsequent actions of moving to the hallway, putting on civilian clothes, and crawling through the vents are all steps toward achieving freedom.
