Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis, the disease associated with that symptom. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but treating Jones is the priority to ensure his health.

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A for Jarkis. This action is necessary because Jones is showing symptoms of a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Treating him with steroids will make him healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Jones becomes healthy.

2. Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated for his unknown condition.

3. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. This action is necessary to determine what symptoms Ross is experiencing so that he can be treated appropriately.

4. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment. If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), he will be treated with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy as well.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
