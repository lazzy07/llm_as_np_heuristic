To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake is currently unhappy, and they want the jewelry (I3). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Casey moves to the bedroom where Alex is. This is necessary because Casey needs to communicate with Alex about the situation.
   
2. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R11)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie since Casey actually wants the jewelry (I3). However, this action is necessary to manipulate Alex's beliefs about what they should do next.

3. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room where Casey is. This is necessary for Alex to be able to interact with Casey and potentially receive the item they want.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is necessary because it fulfills Alex's desire for the chocolates, making Alex happy.

5. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where Alex and Casey are. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.

6. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This is necessary because it allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by giving away the item they want.

7. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake.

8. **give(C2, I1, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Blake. This is necessary because it allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy.

Now, all characters are happy: 
- Alex is happy with the chocolates (I2).
- Blake is happy with the jewelry (I3).
- Casey is happy with the flowers (I1).

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to manipulate the beliefs and desires of the characters to ensure that Blake can achieve their goal of happiness while also considering the happiness of Alex and Casey.
- The lie told by Casey is crucial to redirect Alex's focus and ensure that they receive an item that makes them happy, which in turn allows Blake to fulfill their own desire.
