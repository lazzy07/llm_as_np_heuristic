To ensure Alex achieves their goal of obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex.**
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry, and Blake currently has it. By giving the jewelry to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve their goal.

2. **Casey moves from the living room to the bedroom.**
   - This action is included to allow Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake, which may be necessary for future interactions, even though it does not directly impact Alex's immediate goal.

3. **Casey tells Alex that they want the chocolates.**
   - This action is included to create a dynamic where Casey expresses their desire, which may lead to future trades or exchanges, but it does not affect Alex's goal directly.

4. **Blake moves from the bedroom to the living room.**
   - This action allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, which may facilitate future interactions or trades, but again, it does not directly impact Alex's goal.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex:** This is the critical action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy.
- **Casey moves to the bedroom:** This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but sets up potential future interactions.
- **Casey tells Alex they want the chocolates:** This action adds depth to the story and character motivations but does not affect Alex's goal.
