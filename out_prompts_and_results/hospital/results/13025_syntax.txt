To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Jones, Admissions, ExamRoomB)**: Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment. This action moves Jones to Exam Room B.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Young, ExamRoomC)**: Young is in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room. This action admits Young to Exam Room C, increasing Hathaway's workload to 2.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, ExamRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. Since Ross has SymptomB, Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Jarkis.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, ExamRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, ExamRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B. Since Jones has not shown any symptoms yet, we assume he has Flaze (fever).

6. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, ExamRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Jones becomes healthy.

7. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C. We assume Young has Flaze as well.

8. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients (Ross, Jones, and Young) are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
