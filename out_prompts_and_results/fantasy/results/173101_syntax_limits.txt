In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. He has already picked up the treasure from the cave, but he is still hungry. To achieve his goal of not being hungry, Gargax will eat one of the humans present in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, who is in the cave with him. This action satisfies Gargax's hunger, allowing him to achieve his goal of not being hungry.

This is the only action needed to complete the story, as Gargax's goal is to be wealthy (which he already is with the treasure) and not hungry, which he achieves by eating Rory.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to fulfill his desire of not being hungry. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, he prioritizes his hunger and wealth. Eating Rory eliminates his hunger, thus achieving his goal.
