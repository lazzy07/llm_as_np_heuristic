To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who has proposed to her and is already in possession of treasure. Since Talia is already in a relationship with Rory, we can have them get married, which will make Talia happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action will allow Talia and Rory to get married, which will make Talia happy. Since they are already in a relationship where Talia accepted Rory's proposal, this action is the next logical step to achieve Talia's happiness.

After this action, Talia will be happy, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Talia's goal is to be happy, and marrying Rory, who she has accepted a proposal from, will achieve that goal.
