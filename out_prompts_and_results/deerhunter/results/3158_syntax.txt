Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money without needing to negotiate or ask for it.

2. **Go**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank. This action is included to signify that Bubba is no longer in the bank and has successfully completed his goal.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to take action against the bank clerk.
2. He points his loaded rifle at the clerk and steals the money.
3. With the money in hand, Bubba leaves the bank, satisfied with his acquisition.
