In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to take action.

**Action: Alex tells Casey that the flowers are wanted.**

This action is necessary because it directly communicates to Casey what Alex desires. Since Alex wants to be happy and also wants Casey to be happy, this action sets the stage for a potential exchange.

**Action: Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**

This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is not happy because they have given away the flowers.

However, the goal of the story is for Alex to achieve their happiness, which has been accomplished.
