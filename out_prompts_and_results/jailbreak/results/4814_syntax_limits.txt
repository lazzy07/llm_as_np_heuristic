**Story Completion:**

After stealing the knife from the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway, aware that the bully is in the gym and that he is currently threatened. He knows he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. 

Roy decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, allowing Roy to confront him without the risk of being interrupted or threatened by others.

Next, Roy uses the knife he stole to confront the bully in the gym. With the door locked, he has the upper hand and can take revenge on the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten him or Ernest. This action is essential for Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and not threatened.

With the bully defeated, Roy can now safely return to Ernest, ensuring both of their safety and allowing them to enjoy their time in prison without fear.
