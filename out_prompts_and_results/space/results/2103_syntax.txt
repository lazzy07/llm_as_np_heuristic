To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface, which is necessary for the Lizard to be in the same location as Zoe, allowing for potential interaction.
   
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace while on the surface. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption that will lead to a character's demise.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which will kill any characters on the surface. Since both Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, this action will lead to the Lizard's death, as Zoe is safely on the ship.

The story ends with the Lizard dying due to the eruption while Zoe has successfully made a friend, albeit briefly.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: This action is necessary to bring the Lizard to the same location as Zoe, allowing for interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action initiates the volcanic eruption, which is essential for the story's climax.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action results in the death of the Lizard, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying while also allowing Zoe to remain safe.
