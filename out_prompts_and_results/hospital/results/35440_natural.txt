**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Young is showing a rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B with steroids.**  
   - After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway administers the appropriate treatment for Jarkis, which is steroids. This action ensures that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Young walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - Young moves to Patient Room A, but this action is not necessary for achieving the goal of becoming healthy. However, it can be seen as a way for Young to check on their surroundings or other patients.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to confirm Young's condition and avoid any mistakes in treatment. The second action is essential for Young's health, as it directly addresses the disease Young has. The third action, while not necessary for achieving health, shows Young's movement within the hospital, which can be part of their experience.
