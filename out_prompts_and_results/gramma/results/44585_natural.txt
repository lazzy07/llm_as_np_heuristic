The bandit is currently at the crossroads, armed with a sword and in possession of the hero's coin. The goal of the bandit is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The bandit already has the hero's coin, and the bandit's coin is in the chest at the bandit camp. 

To achieve the goal, the bandit will take the following actions:

1. **Walk from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where the coins are stored in the chest.
2. **Loot the coins from the chest.** This action allows the bandit to collect the coins that were previously stored, thus achieving the goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The story is short and straightforward because the bandit already has one coin and simply needs to retrieve the coins from the chest to fulfill her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the bandit camp:** This is essential as it is the only way for the bandit to access the coins stored in the chest.
- **Looting the coins:** This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
