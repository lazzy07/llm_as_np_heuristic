Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they share a mutual desire to be healthy and safe while also wanting to make friends. To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, which is a safe location away from the dangers of the surface. 

However, Zoe knows that teleporting from the surface to the spaceship will make the Lizard angry, which could jeopardize their newfound friendship. Despite this, Zoe prioritizes her safety and health, believing that she can still maintain a friendly relationship with the Lizard in the future.
