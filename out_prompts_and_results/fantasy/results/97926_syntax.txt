To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged, and also on the treasure in the cave. Hereâ€™s the completion of the story:

1. **Talia travels from Cave to Village**: Talia needs to be in the same location as Rory to finalize their relationship and gain happiness.
   
2. **Talia picks up the Money from Vince**: Since Talia wants to be wealthy, she needs to acquire the money that Vince has.

3. **Talia proposes to Rory**: Since Talia is already engaged to Rory, this action is redundant but can be seen as reaffirming their commitment.

4. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: This action solidifies their relationship, making both of them happy.

5. **Talia and Rory get married**: This finalizes their relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness.

6. **Talia travels back to the Cave**: Talia can now go back to the cave to explore the treasure.

7. **Talia picks up the Treasure**: This action ensures Talia becomes wealthy.
