To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market. He needs to move towards the Crossroads to access the path to the Cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom will walk to the Cottage, which is his desired location.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market, where she can potentially find more coins or interact with other characters.

4. **report(Tom, location(Bandit), Market)**: Tom will report the Bandit's location to the Guard, who is also at the Market. This action is necessary to ensure the Bandit is dealt with, as she poses a threat.

5. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit at the Market, eliminating her as a threat. This is crucial for Tom to safely carry the medicine without fear of being robbed.

6. **loot(Guard, BanditSword, Bandit, Market)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Guard will loot the Bandit for her sword. This action is not directly related to Tom's goal but helps to ensure the Guard is better equipped for future encounters.

7. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will then walk to the Crossroads to ensure the area is secure.

8. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, the Guard will walk to the Cottage to check on Tom and ensure he is safe.

At this point, Tom is at the Cottage with the medicine, having successfully avoided any criminal activity and ensuring his safety.
