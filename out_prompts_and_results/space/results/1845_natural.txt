To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because it places Zoe in a location where the volcano can erupt, allowing the story to progress towards that event.

2. **The surface begins to erupt.**  
   - This is a natural consequence of Zoe being on the surface, and it sets the stage for the impending danger.

3. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.**  
   - Zoe is trying to escape the danger of the eruption by moving to the cave, where the Lizard is located. This action is crucial for the next steps.

4. **The volcano erupts.**  
   - This action occurs after Zoe has moved to the cave, but it is important to note that the eruption will still affect the surface, where Zoe was just located.

5. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This is the outcome of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

6. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - After the eruption, the Lizard moves to the surface, possibly to assess the situation or to find Zoe.

7. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe's memory.**  
   - Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard can still honor their friendship and make peace with the memory of Zoe, ensuring that they remain friends in spirit.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing the Lizard to maintain a sense of friendship with Zoe, even after her demise.
