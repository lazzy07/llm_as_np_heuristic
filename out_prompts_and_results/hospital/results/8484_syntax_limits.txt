In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all patients are healthy. The following actions will be taken to achieve this goal:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomA to confirm the symptoms. Since Young has SymptomA, Hathaway can determine the appropriate treatment.
   
2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats Young with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze, assuming SymptomA corresponds to Flaze). This will make Young healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting to be seen.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B, preparing to assess and treat him next.

5. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. 

By following these actions, Hathaway ensures that Young is treated and healthy, and prepares to treat Jones next, thereby working towards the goal of having all patients healthy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomA, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Hathaway can treat Young effectively and then move on to Jones, maintaining the goal of patient health.
