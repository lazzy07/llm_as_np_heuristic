To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the Cave to the Village. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince, who has the Money. By traveling to the Village, Rory can interact with Vince to achieve his goal.

After this action, Rory can propose to Talia again or take other actions, but since the goal is to keep the story short and focused on Rory's immediate need for wealth, this single action is sufficient to set the stage for Rory's success.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action allows Rory to move to the Village where Vince is located. Since Rory's goal includes being wealthy, he needs to be in a position to access the Money that Vince possesses. 

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["travel(Rory, Cave, Village)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively sets Rory on the path to achieving his goals by positioning him to interact with Vince, who has the Money.
