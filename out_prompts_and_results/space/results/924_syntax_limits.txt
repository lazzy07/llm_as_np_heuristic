In this story, Zoe, the space explorer, is currently safe aboard her spaceship, while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the dangerous surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, creating a perilous situation for the Lizard. 

To ensure the story reaches the desired conclusion, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to help the Lizard, as she wants to make friends and ensure both of them are safe. This action is crucial because it places Zoe in the same location as the Lizard, allowing for potential friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe arrives on the surface, she immediately makes peace with the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. 

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts, which is a necessary event that leads to the conclusion of the story. The eruption results in the Lizard dying, as it is on the surface when the volcano erupts.

The actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption occurs, fulfilling both characters' desires for friendship, while also leading to the Lizard's demise due to the volcanic eruption.
