To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy because they have the item they want (I3). Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are currently in the bathroom (R21).

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the bathroom to get the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Blake to help them achieve their happiness, which indirectly helps Alex.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom. This is necessary for the next action where Alex will give the chocolates to Blake.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the dining room where Blake and Casey are. This is necessary to give the chocolates to Blake.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action makes Blake happy because they now have the item they want.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the bathroom to pick up the jewelry (I1) that Alex wants. This is necessary because Blake now wants to help Alex achieve their happiness.

6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I1) from the bathroom. This is necessary for Blake to give it to Alex.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room to give the jewelry to Alex.

8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want.

Now, Alex is happy, achieving their goal.
