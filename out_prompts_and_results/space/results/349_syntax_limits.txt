3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to make peace, realizing that they both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. This action is crucial for establishing a positive relationship between them.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. However, since they are now friends, they can work together to find a way to escape the eruption.

In this story, the actions taken lead to a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, while also resulting in the eruption of the volcano. The eruption creates a sense of urgency, but their newfound friendship allows them to face the danger together.
