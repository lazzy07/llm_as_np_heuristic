To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is greedy and hungry, sees Bambi in the forest. He decides to shoot Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate a potential threat (Bambi) and also fulfills his hunger by providing him with food.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the kill.

By taking these two actions, Bubba not only satisfies his hunger but also ensures that Bambi is dead, which aligns with the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger after killing Bambi, making it a logical next step.
