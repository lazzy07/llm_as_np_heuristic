**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy finishes his chores in the kitchen and realizes that Ernest is in danger in the gym with the bully. He knows he needs to act quickly to help his friend. 

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where Ernest is.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference.)
3. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
4. **Roy takes the knife from his pocket.** (Roy needs the knife to defend himself and potentially help Ernest.)
5. **Roy confronts the bully and kills him with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now focus on escaping with Ernest.

6. **Roy and Ernest put on civilian clothes.** (This disguises them and allows them to escape.)
7. **Roy and Ernest crawl through the hallway to the highway.** (This is the final step to reach freedom.)
8. **Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** (This action fulfills their goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's survival while eliminating the bully's threat. The locking of the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from escaping and retaliating. Crawling through the vents allows for stealth, and using the knife is a direct means to neutralize the bully. Finally, putting on civilian clothes and escaping is the culmination of their efforts to achieve freedom.
