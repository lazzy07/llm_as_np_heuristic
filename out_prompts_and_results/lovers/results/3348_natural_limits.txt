In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy because they do not have the items they want. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve his goal of happiness, Blake decides to take action. He knows that Casey has the flowers, which Alex mistakenly believes he wants. Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the bathroom, which is a lie, but it leads Alex to think that he should go look for them there. 

Blake then gives the jewelry he has to Casey, who wants it. This action makes Casey happy, and since Blake is now without the jewelry, he can focus on getting the chocolates. 

Now, with Casey happy, Blake can move on to find the chocolates, which he believes are in the bathroom.
