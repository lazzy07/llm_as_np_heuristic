To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The villain threatens the hero.** - This action reinforces the villain's power over the hero, ensuring that the hero remains compliant and does not interfere with the villain's plans.

2. **The villain coerces the hero into wanting the president to have Money.** - By coercing the hero, the villain manipulates the hero's desires to align with the villain's goal of controlling the president. The hero, fearing the villain, will comply.

3. **The hero gives Money to the president.** - The hero, now wanting the president to have Money due to the villain's coercion, gives the Money to the president. This action is crucial as it places the Money in the hands of the president, which the villain can then leverage.

4. **The villain threatens the president.** - With the Money now with the president, the villain can threaten the president to gain control over him. This action is necessary for the villain to assert dominance over the president.

5. **The villain coerces the president into wanting to give Money to the villain.** - By coercing the president, the villain ensures that the president will willingly give the Money back to him, solidifying the villain's control.

6. **The president gives Money to the villain.** - This final action completes the cycle, as the president now hands over the Money to the villain, allowing the villain to gain control over the president.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The villain's initial threat to the hero establishes a power dynamic that keeps the hero in check.

- The villain's threat to the president is a direct method to assert control over him.
- Coercing the president ensures that he acts in the villain's favor, which is essential for the villain's ultimate goal.
