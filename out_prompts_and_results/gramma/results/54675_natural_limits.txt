The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take action. She notices that the merchant has the hero's coin. Since the merchant is armed and the bandit is also armed, the bandit cannot rob the merchant directly. Instead, she chooses to report her location to the guard, knowing that the guard will be distracted by the banditâ€™s presence. 

The bandit walks to the guard and reports her location, which causes the guard to focus on her. This distraction allows the bandit to slip away unnoticed and return to the bandit camp, where she can safely access the chest containing her coins.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. The bandit reports her location to the guard. This action diverts the guard's attention, allowing the bandit to escape without confrontation and return to her camp, where she can secure her coins.
