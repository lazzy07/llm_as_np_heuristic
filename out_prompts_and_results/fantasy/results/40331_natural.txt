To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, and Vince has the money. The treasure is also at the cave, which could potentially make Talia wealthy if she can acquire it. 

Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax is hungry and wants to eat a human. Vince is at the cave, and Gargax can eat him. This action will remove Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her goals without the complication of Vince's presence.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure**: After Vince is eaten, Talia can now pick up the treasure that is at the cave. This action will make Talia wealthy.

3. **Talia's happiness increases**: Since Talia is now wealthy, her happiness will also increase as she achieves one of her goals.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is crucial because it eliminates one of the characters who could potentially interfere with Talia's goals. With Vince gone, Talia can focus on acquiring the treasure without any competition for wealth.

- **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy. By acquiring the treasure, she achieves her desire for wealth, which is one of her primary goals.

The final outcome is that Talia becomes wealthy, which also contributes to her happiness.
