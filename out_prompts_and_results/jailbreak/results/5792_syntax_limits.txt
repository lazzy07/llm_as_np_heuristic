**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Roy is in the laundry room with the pack of cigarettes, but they are both threatened by the bully. To ensure his safety and to get what he wants, Ernest decides to take action. 

Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from coming after him and Roy, ensuring their safety for the moment. 

With the bully locked away, Ernest can now focus on getting the pack of cigarettes from Roy. He moves to the laundry room to meet Roy, who is unaware of the situation. 

Once in the laundry room, Ernest asks Roy to hand over the pack of cigarettes. With the bully out of the picture, they can enjoy a moment of peace together.
