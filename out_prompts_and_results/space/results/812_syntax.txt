To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard while avoiding the dangers of the erupting volcano. The following actions will help her achieve her goals:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe is already on the surface and has previously walked to the cave. She needs to return to the cave to be safe from the erupting volcano.
2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, being the guardian, will follow Zoe to the cave, ensuring both characters are in the same safe location.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Now that both characters are in the cave, Zoe can make peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship.

The actions are chosen to ensure that both characters are safe from the erupting volcano and that they can become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
