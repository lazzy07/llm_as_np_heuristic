**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room A. Jones is in Patient Room B, and Ross is in Admissions. Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy.

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy. 
   
2. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones. Again, Hathaway's workload is still high, but they believe Jones is alive and healthy.

3. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. This is a mistake because Ross does not have Jarkis, but Hathaway's belief leads to the treatment.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. This treatment is correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and can be treated in the future.
