To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom needs to acquire the medicine from the merchant. Since the bandit has robbed Tom of his coin, he cannot buy the medicine directly. However, the merchant is still at the market and can sell it to him if he has a coin.

4. **loot(Tom, TomCoin, Bandit, Market)**: After the bandit is defeated, Tom can loot the banditâ€™s body to retrieve his coin. This is essential for Tom to have the means to buy the medicine.

5. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: With the coin retrieved from the bandit, Tom can now buy the medicine from the merchant.

6. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom will walk from the market to the crossroads.
