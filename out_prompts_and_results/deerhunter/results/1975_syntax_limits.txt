To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and has already expressed greed for money. He needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use his loaded rifle to steal the money from the Clerk. Since he has a loaded gun, he can successfully take the money without any resistance.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held. Without this action, he cannot interact with the Clerk or obtain the money.
  
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the Clerk using the threat of his loaded rifle. It directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money, which is one of the desired outcomes.
