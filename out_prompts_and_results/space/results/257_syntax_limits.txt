Zoe, aboard her spaceship, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and in danger due to the erupting volcano. She wants to help the Lizard and make a friend. To achieve this, she decides to teleport down to the surface to assist the Lizard.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to reach the Lizard and offer her help.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located, intending to find him and ensure his safety.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe finds the Lizard, she makes peace with him, establishing a friendship and ensuring both of them are safe from the volcano.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
