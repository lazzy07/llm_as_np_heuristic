Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients currently in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is in the admissions room, this action is necessary to understand what treatment is needed.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** Assuming Young has Jarkis (the only disease with a rash), this treatment is appropriate. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2 and ensures Young becomes healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is in Patient Room C, this action is necessary to understand what treatment is needed.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** Assuming Ross has Flaze (the only disease with a fever), this treatment is appropriate. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 1 and ensures Ross becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
