In the current situation, Casey (C3) wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy, but they currently have the chocolates (I2). Alex (C1) is already happy with the flowers (I1), while Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2). 

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Casey can trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Blake wants. This action is beneficial because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (jewelry) while also making Blake happy by giving them the chocolates they desire.

The action sequence is as follows:

- **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake for the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R21). 

After this action, the situation will be:

- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy.
- Alex remains happy with the flowers (I1).

This single trade action effectively allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
