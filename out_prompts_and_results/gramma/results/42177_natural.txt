To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the guard is armed and poses a threat to the bandit. By attacking the guard, the bandit can eliminate this threat and potentially loot the guard's sword or any coins he may have.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.** After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit can loot the guard's corpse to take his sword and any coins he may have. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying more coins.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** After acquiring the sword and any coins from the guard, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins in the chest. This action ensures that the bandit can secure her gains.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest.** Finally, the bandit will place the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

1. The bandit attacks the guard.
