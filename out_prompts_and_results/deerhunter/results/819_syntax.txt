To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the clerk, and he has a loaded rifle. The clerk is also alive and has no money. Bubba is hungry, which means he might consider eating, but his primary goal is to get money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only character in the bank who could potentially have money, and Bubba needs to ensure he can take it without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat him since he is now dead. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can now focus on his greed and decide to take the money from the clerk's body.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger after killing the clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba successfully obtains the money, fulfilling his objective.
