To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as she has accepted his proposal. The next steps will involve Talia and Vince getting married, which will make them both happy. After that, Talia can pick up the treasure in the cave, which will make her wealthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action is necessary because Talia wants to be happy, and marrying Vince, who she has accepted a proposal from, will fulfill that desire.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This action makes Talia happy because she is now married to Vince, fulfilling her emotional goal.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, thus achieving her goal of wealth.

With these two actions, Talia successfully achieves her goals of happiness and wealth.
