To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Jones is assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room C. This will help determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is important to ensure that Young's condition is also evaluated and treated appropriately.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Ross also recovers.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This completes the treatment for all patients.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their recovery.
