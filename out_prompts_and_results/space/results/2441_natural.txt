Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is in danger on the surface, decides to help. She teleports from the ship to the surface to check on the Lizard. Upon arriving, she sees the Lizard and understands that they both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. 

Zoe approaches the Lizard and initiates a conversation, expressing her desire to be friends and to help the Lizard. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, agrees to become friends. 

Now that they have established a friendship, Zoe suggests they both find a safe place away from the dangerous surface, especially since the volcano could erupt at any moment. They decide to walk together to the cave, where they can be safe and continue to build their friendship.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Zoe teleports to the surface to help the Lizard.
2. Zoe initiates a conversation with the Lizard to express her desire for friendship.
3. The Lizard agrees to become friends.
4. They walk to the cave together for safety.

Each action is necessary to achieve Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain healthy and safe.
