To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the village, and she has already proposed to Rory, who is at the cave. Vince has proposed to Talia, but she has not yet accepted his proposal. Gargax is hungry and is at the village, which poses a threat to the humans.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** This action will make Talia happy because she is now married to Vince, who has the money. This is crucial for Talia's goal of becoming happy.
   
2. **Gargax eats Rory.** This action is necessary because it removes a potential threat to Talia and Vince. Since Gargax is hungry, he will eat Rory, who is at the cave. This action does not directly affect Talia's happiness but ensures her safety.

3. **Vince travels to the cave.** Vince will travel to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which is essential for Talia to become wealthy.

4. **Vince picks up the treasure.** By picking up the treasure, Vince will increase their wealth, which is also a goal for Talia.

5. **Vince travels back to the village.** This action is necessary for Vince to return to Talia with the treasure.

6. **Talia and Vince become wealthy.** With the treasure in their possession, Talia's wealth increases, contributing to her overall happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: This action makes Talia happy.
- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action removes a threat to Talia and Vince.
- **Vince travels to the cave**: This action is necessary to retrieve the treasure.
- **Vince picks up the treasure**: This action increases Talia's wealth.
- **Vince travels back to the village**: This action brings the treasure back to Talia.
- **Talia and Vince become wealthy**: This final state ensures Talia's happiness and wealth.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
