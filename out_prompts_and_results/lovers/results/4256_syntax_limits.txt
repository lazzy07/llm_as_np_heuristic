In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is not happy because they want item I1 (the flowers), which is in the same room as them (R22). Casey is already happy because they have item I3 (the jewelry). 

To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, they need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want. Since Alex wants I1, Blake can give I1 to Alex. This action will make Alex happy, and since Blake's happiness is tied to Alex's happiness, Blake will also be happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, both Alex and Blake are happy, achieving Blake's goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving I1 (flowers) to Alex is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, which in turn fulfills Blake's desire to see Alex happy. Since Blake's happiness is contingent on Alex's happiness, this single action is sufficient to achieve Blake's goal.
