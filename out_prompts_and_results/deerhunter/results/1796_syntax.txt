To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, which means he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can obtain from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the bank clerk is located. This action is necessary to confront the clerk and attempt to get money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle he has. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to obtain money, and since he has a loaded gun, he can successfully steal from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have satisfied his hunger and achieved his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to obtain money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
