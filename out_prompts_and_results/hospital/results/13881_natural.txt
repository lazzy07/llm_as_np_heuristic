**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that all patients are currently in the admissions room and experiencing unknown symptoms, decides to take immediate action to assess and treat them. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to be in the same location as the patients (Jones, Ross, and Young) to assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action assigns Jones to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him. It also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 4, but this is necessary to ensure all patients are treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to be in Patient Room A to assess Jones.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 4, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to proceed.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to return to the admissions room to admit the next patient.

7. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action assigns Ross to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him.

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to be in Patient Room B to assess Ross.

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial to determine Ross's symptoms. Again, there is a risk of making a mistake due to the workload.

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
    - Assuming Ross has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. If Ross indeed has Jarkis, he will become healthy.

11. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions.**  
    - Dr. Hathaway needs to return to the admissions room to admit the last patient.

12. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
    - This action assigns Young to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him.

13. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
    - Dr. Hathaway needs to be in Patient Room C to assess Young.

14. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
    - This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms. 

15. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
    - Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Young indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.
