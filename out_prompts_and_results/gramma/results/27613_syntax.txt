To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the market, so she will walk to the crossroads to confront Tom, who is currently there with the medicine.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is unarmed and carrying the medicine. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her wealth.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to her camp, where she can store her newly acquired coin.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from her possession and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to successfully acquire coins and store them, fulfilling her objective.
