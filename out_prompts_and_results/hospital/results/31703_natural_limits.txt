Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, assesses Young and confirms that Young is experiencing Fever, which indicates that Young has Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, they can treat Young without making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young of Flaze.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to, as Jones is still in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room.
