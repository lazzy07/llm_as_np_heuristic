**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry and kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway, holding the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he and Roy are both threatened by him. To protect himself and Roy, Ernest decides to take action.

1. **lock_gym(Ernest, Hall)**: Ernest locks the gym door from the hallway. This prevents the bully from coming out and threatening them further. It also gives Ernest and Roy a chance to strategize without the bully's immediate threat.

2. **vent(Ernest, Gym)**: Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym. He knows that the bully is trapped inside and that he has the opportunity to confront him.

3. **revenge(Ernest, Bully, Gym)**: Once inside the gym, Ernest uses the knife he previously stole from the kitchen to kill the bully. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Roy.

4. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: After killing the bully, Ernest returns to the hallway and puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. This disguise will help him escape the prison without being recognized.

5. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Finally, Ernest makes his way to the highway and escapes from the prison, successfully overcoming the bully's threats and ensuring his survival.
