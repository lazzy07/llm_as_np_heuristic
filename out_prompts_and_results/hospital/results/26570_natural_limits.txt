Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on him without increasing her workload significantly. After assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. She then treats Ross with antibiotics, which successfully makes him healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. This allows her to manage her workload effectively while ensuring that Young can be assessed and treated in a timely manner.
