In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that Blake has, as that is what Blake wants. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Alex (C1) for the chocolates (I2) that Blake (C2) has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants, which is the jewelry, while also giving Blake something in return that they may want.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Casey now has the jewelry (I3), which makes Casey happy.
- Blake has the chocolates (I2), which may also make Blake happy, depending on their preferences.

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want, while also considering Blake's happiness.
