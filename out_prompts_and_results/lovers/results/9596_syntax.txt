To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any room, and we need to facilitate the transfer of items among the characters to achieve this.

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and facilitate the exchange of items.
   
2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I1) to Blake. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to have an item, which may help in the next steps.

3. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I2). This is a strategic move to inform Casey about Blake's desire, which may lead to further actions.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R12) to check for the jewelry. This is necessary for Casey to find the item that Blake wants.

5. **put_down(C3, I1, R12)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I1) in the living room. This action is necessary to clear Casey's hands for the next step.

6. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) to interact with Blake again.

7. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This is the final action that ensures Blake has the item they want, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Movement**: Characters need to be in the same room to interact, so moving between rooms is essential.
- **Giving Items**: The act of giving is crucial for transferring items to ensure characters receive what they want.
- **Telling**: Communicating desires helps characters understand what they need to do to make each other happy.
