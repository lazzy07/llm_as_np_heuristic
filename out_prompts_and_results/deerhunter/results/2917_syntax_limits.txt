To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just killed Bambi, to the bank, where he can access the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling his greedy desire for money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"

``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is dead, as required by the story's conditions.
