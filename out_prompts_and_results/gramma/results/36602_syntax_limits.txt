To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit can take the following action:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit can rob the merchant at the crossroads to take the coins that the merchant has. This action is possible because the bandit is armed and the merchant is not. By successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit will increase her coin count, fulfilling her goal.

This is the only action needed to ensure the bandit achieves her goal of carrying coins.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: This action allows the bandit to take the coins from the merchant, which directly contributes to her goal of having coins. The bandit is in a position to rob because she is armed, and the merchant is unarmed, making this action valid and effective.
