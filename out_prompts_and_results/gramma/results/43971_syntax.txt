To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coins she has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and the Merchant is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the coins are safely stored, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This is the Bandit's primary action to gain coins without risking confrontation with the Guard, who is at the Market.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This is a strategic move to secure her loot and avoid any potential threats from the Guard or Tom.
- **Taking the Coins to the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
