**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, who was in the hallway, realized that he needed to act quickly to protect both himself and Ernest from the bully's threats. He decided to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them. 

After locking the gym door, Roy put on the civilian clothes he had stolen from the laundry room. This disguise would allow him to escape from the prison without being recognized. With the gym door securely locked, Roy felt a sense of relief knowing that the bully was trapped inside and could not threaten them for the moment.

Finally, Roy crawled through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he was on the highway, he took off the civilian clothes, ensuring he was no longer disguised, and made his way to freedom.
