The bandit, believing that the hero is at the crossroads and the merchant is at the market, decides to take action to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She walks from the cottage to the crossroads, where she encounters the hero and the merchant. 

At the crossroads, the bandit sees that the merchant is armed and the hero is not. The bandit, wanting to take advantage of the situation, decides to rob the hero. Since the hero is not carrying a sword, the bandit successfully robs the hero of the medicine.
