To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R21) and does not have the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2) in the dining room (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the living room to the dining room to be closer to Casey, who has the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey and obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex.
   - This action is essential because it allows Alex to receive the item they want, which will make them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.
