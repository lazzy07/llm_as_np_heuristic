Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and both are healthy but not safe. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, they need to find a way to escape the dangerous surface.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. Since she is not safe on the surface, teleporting to the spaceship is the best option for her.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Although this action makes the Lizard angry, Zoe needs to return to the surface to help the Lizard escape the danger. Their friendship means she cares about the Lizard's safety.

3. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action allows both Zoe and the Lizard to move to a safer location away from the erupting volcano. The cave is a safer place for them to be.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they remain allies, which is important for both of their goals of being healthy and safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard walk from the cave to the surface.** - They need to assess the situation and ensure that the volcano is no longer a threat. 

6. **Zoe and the Lizard walk back to the cave.** - After confirming the danger, they return to the cave to stay safe until the eruption is over.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
