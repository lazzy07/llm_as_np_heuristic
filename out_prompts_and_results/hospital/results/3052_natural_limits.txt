Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is too high and that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to take action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess him for symptoms. This also reduces her workload by one.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - Similar to Jones, admitting Young allows for assessment and reduces the workload further.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial to determine if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis. Since he is experiencing unknown symptoms, this assessment will clarify his condition.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze based on the assessment, treating him with the correct medication will ensure he becomes healthy.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones, reducing her workload and ensuring that at least one patient is healthy. 

Now, Dr. Hathaway can repeat similar actions for Young and Ross, but the story ends here with Jones being treated successfully.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

  "plan": [
    "Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.",

    "Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.",
    "Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.",
    "Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of making patients healthy while keeping the story concise.
