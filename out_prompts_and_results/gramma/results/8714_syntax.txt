To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from Camp to Crossroads**: The Merchant needs to be at the Crossroads to interact with Tom, who is currently there.

2. **Merchant buys the medicine from Tom**: The Merchant uses one of her coins to buy the medicine from Tom. This action allows her to gain an item of value while also reducing her coin count, which is acceptable as long as she doesn't become a criminal.

4. **Merchant takes the coins from the chest at the Camp**: The Merchant takes the coins from the chest, maximizing her coin count without committing any crimes.
