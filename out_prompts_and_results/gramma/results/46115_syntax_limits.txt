In this story, the Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has already walked to the Market, where Tom is located. The Bandit can take advantage of the situation to achieve her goal.

**Story Completion:**

1. The Bandit walks from the Crossroads to the Market. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to be at the Market to potentially rob Tom, who is carrying a sword and has no coins.

2. The Bandit robs Tom, taking the medicine he is carrying. This action is crucial because it allows the Bandit to take an item from Tom, which is a step towards achieving her goal of carrying more valuable items.

3. The Bandit then walks back to the Crossroads with the medicine. This action is necessary to return to a safe location after the robbery.

4. Finally, the Bandit takes the medicine to the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully stored the item in her camp, contributing to her goal of having valuable items.
