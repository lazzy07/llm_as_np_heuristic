In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy because they do not have the items they want. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Blake decides to take action. Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom to search for the chocolates, believing they are there. 

This action is necessary because it allows Blake to pursue their goal of obtaining the chocolates, which is the only way for Blake to become happy. 

After Blake moves to the bathroom, they find the chocolates and are now happy.
