Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross, who are both experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

Dr. Hathaway first assesses Jones, who is in Admissions. After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Jones is likely experiencing symptoms of Flaze due to the fever. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully making Jones healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also in Admissions. Dr. Hathaway deduces that Ross is likely experiencing symptoms of Jarkis due to the rash. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully making Ross healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Young again. After reassessing, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Young is also experiencing symptoms of Flaze and treats Young with antibiotics, making Young healthy.

In this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
