**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway knows that Jones is experiencing Fever and has been admitted to Patient Room B, where he can be treated for Flaze. 

Hathaway decides to walk to Patient Room B to treat Jones. Upon arriving, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Ross again. Since Ross's symptoms are still unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to the workload being at 3 after treating Jones. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross does not have Flaze. Unfortunately, Ross dies.

Finally, Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young, who is experiencing Rash. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Hathaway successfully treats Jones and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
