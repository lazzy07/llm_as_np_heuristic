To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit walks to the Market to confront the Merchant and Tom, who are both present there. This is necessary for the Bandit to take action to acquire coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins that the Merchant has. This action is crucial for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks back to the Crossroads. This is necessary to position herself for the next action.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins she has acquired and places them in the chest at the bandit camp. This fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal without any unnecessary actions.
