Zoe and the Lizard are both on the surface of the planet, and the situation is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. They have already made peace with each other, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals of safety and friendship. 

To ensure the Lizard achieves their goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe realizes the danger of the erupting volcano and decides to lead the Lizard to the cave, which is a safer location. This action helps both characters move to a safer area, aligning with their goals of safety.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring that both characters are now in a safe location away from the danger of the volcano. This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of safety.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts after they have safely moved to the cave. This action is included to show the danger that was present on the surface, emphasizing the importance of their decision to move.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action can be seen as a reaffirmation of their friendship in the safety of the cave. It solidifies their bond and ensures that they remain allies.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship, as they are now safe from the erupting volcano and have strengthened their relationship.
