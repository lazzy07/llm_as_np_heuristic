To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Young's symptoms is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment. This is essential for Young to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomA. This action is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will assume that Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the appropriate treatment based on the identified symptoms. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to recover and achieve their goal of being healthy.

By following these steps, Young will successfully become healthy, achieving their goal.
