To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, they can get married, which will make Talia happy. Additionally, Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located, and she can pick it up to increase her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.
2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Talia wants to be wealthy. By picking up the treasure, she increases her wealth, which is a direct step towards achieving her goal.
  
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, this action is the next logical step. Getting married will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

With these two actions, Talia will achieve both happiness and wealth.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
