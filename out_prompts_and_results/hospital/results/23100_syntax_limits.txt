In this story, Dr. Hathaway is in the hospital admissions room and has already admitted Jones to exam room A. Jones is showing symptoms of a disease (SymptomA), which we will assume is Flaze, as it is the only symptom currently known. Young is also in exam room A, and Ross is in the admissions room. 

To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess Young and Ross, treat them if necessary, and manage their symptoms effectively. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room A to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Young needs treatment.

2. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, SymptomC, Admissions**: Hathaway assesses Ross in the admissions room to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is also necessary to understand if Ross needs treatment.

3. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway treats them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Young's recovery.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, Admissions**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway treats them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Ross's recovery.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that both Young and Ross are treated appropriately, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
