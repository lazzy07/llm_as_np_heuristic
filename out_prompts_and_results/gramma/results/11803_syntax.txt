To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit has already robbed Tom of his coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit has successfully robbed Tom and now has his coin, and she will take the coins from the chest at her camp, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count by taking Tom's coin. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can successfully rob him without any risk.
  
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to retrieve the coins from her camp's chest, ensuring she has a significant amount of coins, thus achieving her goal.
