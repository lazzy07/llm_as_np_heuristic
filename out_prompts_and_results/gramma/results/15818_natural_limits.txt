**Story Completion:**

The bandit, seeing the hero at the crossroads, decides to take action. She approaches Tom, who is unarmed and unaware of the danger. The bandit draws her sword and attacks Tom, killing him instantly. She then loots the medicine from his corpse, adding it to her collection of stolen goods.

With Tom dead, the bandit now has the medicine and can return to the bandit camp, where she can store her loot safely, including the coins in the chest.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Attack Tom**: The bandit uses her sword to attack Tom because he is unarmed and poses no threat to her. This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate a non-criminal who could potentially report her to the guard.
   
2. **Loot the medicine**: After killing Tom, the bandit loots the medicine from his corpse. This action helps her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins and valuable items as possible.
