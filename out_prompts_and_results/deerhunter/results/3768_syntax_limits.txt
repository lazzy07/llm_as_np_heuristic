To achieve the goal of having Bubba end up with the money or ensuring Bambi is dead (or both), we can take the following action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and has already shot Bambi, who is now dead. He is greedy and wants money, so he decides to go to the Bank where the Clerk is located.

This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to reach the Bank where he can confront the Clerk and potentially take the money.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Bubba will be at the Bank, where he can interact with the Clerk.
- Bambi is already dead, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending.

Thus, the story can be completed with just this single action.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential as it allows Bubba to move to the location where the Clerk is, setting him up to either steal the money or confront the Clerk.
