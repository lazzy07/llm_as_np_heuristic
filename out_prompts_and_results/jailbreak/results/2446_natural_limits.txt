**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He quickly grabs the knife from the kitchen, knowing he needs to defend himself and Roy. He then moves to the hallway, where he can hear the bully in the gym, still unaware of his intentions.

In the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action is crucial as it prevents the bully from escaping and allows Ernest to confront him without the risk of being attacked from behind.

With the gym door locked, Ernest enters the gym, knife in hand. The bully, realizing he is trapped, turns to face Ernest, but itâ€™s too late. In a moment of desperation, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, finally overcoming the threat that loomed over him and Roy.

With the bully dead, Ernest takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he must escape before the guards arrive.
