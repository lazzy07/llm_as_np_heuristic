To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy because they have the jewelry (I3). Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want the chocolates (I2).

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) that Blake (C2) has. This is possible because all characters are in the same room (R12), and it allows Alex to get the item they want.

2. **Give**: After the trade, Alex (C1) will give the flowers (I1) to themselves, which is a way to confirm that they now possess the item they wanted.

Now, let's break down the actions:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)**: This action allows Alex to exchange the jewelry (I3) for the flowers (I1). This is necessary because Alex needs to obtain the flowers to be happy.

2. **give(C1, I1, C1, R12)**: This action confirms that Alex now has the flowers (I1) in their possession, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)",
    "give(C1, I1, C1, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
