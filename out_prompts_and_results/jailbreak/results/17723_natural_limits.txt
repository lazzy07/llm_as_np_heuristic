**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realized that he had a chance to escape. He knew that Ernest was in the gym, threatened by the bully, and he needed to act quickly. 

Roy crawled through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he found Ernest. The bully was distracted, lifting weights and boasting about his strength. Roy quietly approached Ernest and whispered, "I have the clothes. We can escape together."

However, they needed to deal with the bully first. Roy, still hidden in his disguise, grabbed a nearby weight and threw it at the bully, stunning him momentarily. This gave Ernest the opportunity to grab the knife that was hidden in the gym. 

With the knife in hand, Ernest confronted the bully. "You won't threaten us anymore!" he shouted, and in a swift motion, he used the knife to kill the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy and Ernest quickly made their way to the hallway. Roy helped Ernest put on the civilian clothes, disguising him as well. They then rushed to the highway, where they could finally escape from the prison.
