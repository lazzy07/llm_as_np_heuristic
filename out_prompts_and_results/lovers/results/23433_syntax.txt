To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want (I1, which is jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially trade or receive the item they want.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item, which may help in future trades or interactions.

3. **tell(C1, C3, I2, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to create a situation where Casey might be willing to trade or give away the item they have.

4. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) for the chocolates (I2) with Alex. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to finally obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the room (R21) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps in concluding the story.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey and Blake to interact with them.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: This allows Alex to have an item, which is essential for trading.
- **tell(C1, C3, I2, R22)**: This action is a strategic move to influence Casey's decision-making.
- **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to get the jewelry they want.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This is a concluding action to wrap up the story.
