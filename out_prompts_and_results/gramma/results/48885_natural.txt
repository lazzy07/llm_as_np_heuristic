The bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit has already looted the hero's coin from the merchant, she can now take the following actions to achieve her goal:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to move to her preferred location where she can store her coins.

2. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action ensures that the bandit has successfully stored the coin, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

The story is short because the bandit has already looted a coin and only needs to move to her camp to secure it. The actions taken are necessary to fulfill her objective of having coins in the chest.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
