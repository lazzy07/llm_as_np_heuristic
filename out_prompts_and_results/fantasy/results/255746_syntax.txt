To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to gain wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be closer to Talia and potentially gain wealth.
2. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money that is at the village, which will help him achieve his goal of wealth.
3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the money.
4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia, which makes both of them happy.
5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry, but since he has money, he can buy food.
6. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave to find food or treasure.
7. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which is not ideal, but it ensures that Rory's wealth is not lost and Talia can still use the treasure.

In this story, Rory achieves his goal of being wealthy by picking up the money and marrying Talia, which makes him happy. However, he becomes hungry and is eaten by Gargax, which is a twist that ultimately leads to Talia being able to use the treasure for her own happiness.
