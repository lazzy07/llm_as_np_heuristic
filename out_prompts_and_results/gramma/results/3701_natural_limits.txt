The merchant, realizing the danger posed by the bandit, decides to take action to protect herself and her goods. She quickly walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is present. 

Once at the market, the merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the presence of a criminal, which aligns with the guard's goal of eliminating criminals. The guard, now aware of the bandit's location, can take action to apprehend her.

By reporting the bandit, the merchant ensures her safety and secures her position in the market without becoming a criminal herself. This also allows her to keep the medicine she possesses, as the bandit is now a target for the guard.

In this way, the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, as she remains in the market and is protected by the guard.
