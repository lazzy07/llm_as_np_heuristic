To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba is at the bank and the clerk has 1 money, and Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's outline the story with the necessary actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to achieve his goal of having money, and the clerk is the only one with money at this point.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action allows Bubba to take the money he desires, thus achieving his goal.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, which is his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
