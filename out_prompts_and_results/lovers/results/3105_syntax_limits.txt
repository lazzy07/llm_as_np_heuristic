In the current situation, Blake (C3) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Blake needs to ensure that Casey (C2) receives the item they want (I2), which is currently unknown to Blake. 

Since Alex (C1) has the item (I1) that they want, and Blake knows that Alex wants I1, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the item they have (I2) with Alex for the item Alex has (I1). This will make both Blake and Alex happy, as they will each receive the item they want.

Here’s the complete story with the necessary action:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R12)**: Blake trades the item they have (I2) with Alex for the item Alex has (I1) in the living room (R12). After this trade, Blake will have I2, which makes them happy, and Alex will have I1, which makes them happy as well.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- happy(C1) = True (because Alex has I1)
- happy(C2) = True (because Casey has I2)
- happy(C3) = True (because Blake has I2)

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R12)"]
}
``` 

This action is the only necessary step to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of happiness while also considering the happiness of Alex.
