Zoe, having just made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows that the Lizard is still on the surface and is in danger. To ensure both their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard.

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to avoid the danger of the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure her safety and to strategize how to help the Lizard.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a natural consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. This action results in the Lizard being killed, as he is still on the surface when the eruption occurs.

In this story, Zoe's actions are focused on her safety and the safety of the Lizard. However, despite her intentions, the eruption leads to the Lizard's demise, which ultimately prevents them from becoming friends in a more traditional sense. The story ends with the volcano erupting and the Lizard dying, fulfilling the requirement of the ending.
