To ensure Casey achieves their goal of obtaining the jewelry, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows them to do so while considering the desires of Alex and Blake. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.** (Casey wants the jewelry, and since Alex is in the dining room with the jewelry, this action allows Casey to achieve their goal.)
2. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.** (This action allows Casey to change locations and potentially interact with Blake.)
3. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.** (This action allows Casey to make Blake happy, as Blake wants the jewelry.)
4. **Blake gives chocolates to Casey.** (This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy, as they want the chocolates.)

At this point, Casey has the jewelry, Blake has the chocolates, and Alex has the flowers, making all characters happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex:** This is necessary for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
- **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room:** This allows Casey to interact with Blake, who is in the living room.
- **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake:** This action helps Casey to make Blake happy, which is part of the interconnected goals of the characters.
- **Blake gives chocolates to Casey:** This allows Blake to achieve their goal of happiness while also ensuring Casey is happy with the jewelry.
