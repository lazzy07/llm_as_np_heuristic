**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows he needs to get the knife from the kitchen to defend himself and Roy. 

1. **Action: Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to have a means of defense against the bully, who has threatened both him and Roy.

2. **Action: Ernest moves to the hallway.**  
   - By moving to the hallway, Ernest can access the gym where the bully is located.

3. **Action: Ernest locks the gym door.**  
   - This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Ernest a chance to confront him without the risk of being attacked from behind.

4. **Action: Ernest kills the bully with the knife.**  
   - This is the final action that ensures Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to feel safe and secure.

5. **Action: Ernest puts on the civilian clothes (if they were found).**  
   - This action is not necessary in this scenario since the clothes were confiscated earlier, but if they were available, it would allow for a potential escape.

6. **Action: Ernest escapes through the highway (if he had civilian clothes).**  
   - Again, this action is contingent on having the civilian clothes, but it would be the final step to ensure Ernest's safety.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at eliminating the threat posed by the bully. The knife is essential for self-defense, and locking the gym door ensures that the bully cannot escape or retaliate. Killing the bully is the ultimate goal to ensure both Ernest and Roy can live without fear. The potential escape through the highway is a secondary goal that would further secure their freedom.
