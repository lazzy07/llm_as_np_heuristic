To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have given away the item they had (jewelry) to Casey.
- Casey will be happy because they received the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
- Blake remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this is acceptable.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to reach Alex, who has the jewelry.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: This action is the key to making Casey happy, as it provides them with the item they desire.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:
