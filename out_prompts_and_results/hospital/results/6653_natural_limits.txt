Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room, where Jones, Ross, and Young are waiting.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can begin the process of assessing and treating him. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check Ross's symptoms to determine the appropriate treatment. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but for the sake of the story, we will assume Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which successfully makes Ross healthy. This reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young's symptoms to determine the correct treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has Jarkis (rash), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, successfully making Young healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
