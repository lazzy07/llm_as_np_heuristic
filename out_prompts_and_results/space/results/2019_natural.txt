Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and to strengthen their friendship.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is taken to find a safe place away from the dangerous surface, as the cave is likely to provide shelter from the erupting volcano. By walking together, they reinforce their friendship and cooperation.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they are already friends, this action emphasizes their commitment to working together and ensures that they remain allies in the face of danger.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event is a natural consequence of the story's setting, and it serves to heighten the urgency of Zoe and the Lizard's actions. However, since they are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard celebrate their friendship in the cave.** This action solidifies their bond and fulfills Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures, including the Lizard.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
