Bubba is at the bank and wants to have 1 money. The clerk has 1 money and is not hungry, while Bubba is hungry. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to hand over the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Deciding to steal:** This is a necessary action because Bubba needs to obtain money, and the clerk is the only character with money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.
- **Stealing the money:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. 

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, and the story will conclude.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
