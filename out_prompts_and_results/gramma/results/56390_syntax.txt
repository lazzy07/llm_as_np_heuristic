To achieve the goal of the Bandit, who wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp, we can outline the following actions:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to find Tom, who has the medicine and is also at the Crossroads. This action is necessary to confront Tom and potentially rob him.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit can rob Tom because Tom is unarmed and the Bandit is armed. This action allows the Bandit to take the coins that Tom has, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads to ensure she is in a safe location with her newly acquired coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary for the Bandit to reach Tom and confront him.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins from Tom, which directly contributes to her goal.
- The third action is to ensure the Bandit is in a safe location after the robbery.
- The final action allows the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, completing her objective.
