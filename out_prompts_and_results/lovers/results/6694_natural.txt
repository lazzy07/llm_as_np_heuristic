To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers and ensuring that he is happy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey currently has the flowers in the living room, and Alex wants them. By picking them up, Casey can then give them to Alex.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to fulfill Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the living room and now has the flowers, making him happy.
- Blake is still in the dining room and remains unhappy because he still wants the chocolates.
- Casey is in the living room and has given away the flowers, but she is still unhappy because she wants the chocolates.

This sequence of actions is the shortest way to ensure that Alex achieves his goal of happiness.
