**Story Completion:**

After walking to Exam Room C, Hathaway assesses Young, who is currently in that room. Since Young has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway cannot determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis. However, Hathaway knows that Young is alive and healthy, so she decides to treat Young with antibiotics, assuming that Young might have Flaze. 

Next, Hathaway returns to the Admissions room to admit Jones to Exam Room A. She assesses Jones, who is also asymptomatic, and treats him with antibiotics as well, believing he might have Flaze. 

Finally, Hathaway goes back to the Admissions room to admit Ross to Exam Room B. She assesses Ross, who is also asymptomatic, and treats him with antibiotics, assuming he might have Flaze as well.

In this way, Hathaway successfully treats all three patients with antibiotics, ensuring they all remain alive and healthy.
