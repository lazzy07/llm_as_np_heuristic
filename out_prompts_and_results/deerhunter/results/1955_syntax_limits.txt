To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is in the forest with a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions of the ending.

2. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can decide to take the money from the bank clerk, as he is now free to do so without any immediate threat. However, since he already has the money from the bank, this action is not strictly necessary for the ending but reinforces his greed.

The story can be summarized as follows:

Bubba, having loaded his rifle, goes into the forest where he encounters Bambi. Driven by his greed and hunger, he decides to shoot Bambi, ensuring that she is dead. With Bambi out of the way, Bubba can now focus on his greed and the money he has already taken from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
