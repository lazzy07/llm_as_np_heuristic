**Story Completion:**

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and Blake is currently in the living room where the jewelry is located. By picking it up, Blake can later give it to Casey, which will help both of them achieve their goals.

2. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of being happy by receiving the jewelry they want. Since Casey is currently in the living room, this action is possible and directly fulfills Casey's desire.

3. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - After receiving the jewelry, Casey can now focus on helping Alex. Since Casey knows that Alex wants the flowers, they can pick them up to give to Alex.

4. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy by receiving the flowers they want. 

At this point, all characters have achieved their goals: Alex has the flowers, Blake has the chocolates (which they can get next), and Casey has the jewelry.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that the characters can achieve their happiness by obtaining the items they desire. The sequence of actions is minimal and efficient, allowing Alex to achieve their goal of happiness through the flowers.
