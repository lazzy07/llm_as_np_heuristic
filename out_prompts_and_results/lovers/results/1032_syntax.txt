To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want. In this case, Blake wants the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because Alex is currently in the living room and can now receive the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C1, R11, R21)**: Alex moves from the living room (R11) to the dining room (R21). This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake to give them the item.

4. **give(C1, I3, C2)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2). This final action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, making them happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Casey moves to the living room** to be able to interact with Alex.
- **Casey gives the jewelry to Alex** so that Alex can then give it to Blake.
- **Alex moves to the dining room** to be in the same room as Blake.
- **Alex gives the jewelry to Blake**, fulfilling Blake's desire and making them happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
