To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, they can get married, which will make Talia happy. After that, Talia can travel to the cave to pick up the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married, which makes Talia happy. This is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of happiness.
2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to find the treasure. This action is necessary for her to become wealthy.
3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure, which fulfills her goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Vince) and wealthy (from picking up the treasure), thus achieving her goals.
