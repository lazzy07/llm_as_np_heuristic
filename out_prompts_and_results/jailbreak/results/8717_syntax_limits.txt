**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy, who is currently in the hallway, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes, which Roy wants. However, he also knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest. 

To ensure their safety and to get what he wants, Roy decides to crawl through the vents to the gym. Once inside, he sees the bully and quickly takes out the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen. In a swift motion, Roy kills the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Ernest. With the bully gone, Roy can now take the pack of cigarettes and return to Ernest without fear.

**Explanation of Actions:**

2. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: Roy kills the bully with the knife. This action is crucial as it removes the immediate threat to both him and Ernest, allowing Roy to feel safe and secure.
