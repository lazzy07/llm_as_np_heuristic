**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, noticing that Young is experiencing a fever, decides to treat Young for Flaze, the disease associated with that symptom. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently 2, she can safely treat Young without the risk of making a mistake.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Young has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. By treating him with antibiotics, Young will become healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1, and Young is now healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat them as needed.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. By assessing Jones, Hathaway can identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment.** If Jones shows symptoms of fever, he will be treated for Flaze; if he shows a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

At this point, both Young and Jones are healthy, and Hathaway has achieved her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
