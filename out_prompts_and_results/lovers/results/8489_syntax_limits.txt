In the current situation, Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R22) holding the jewelry (I3), while Casey (C3) is in the living room (R21) and Blake (C2) is also in the dining room (R22). Alex wants the flowers (I1), which are currently with Casey, and Blake wants the chocolates (I2), which are in the living room.

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, they need to get the flowers from Casey. The simplest way to do this is for Alex to give the jewelry they are holding to Blake, who can then trade the chocolates with Casey for the flowers.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they are holding with Blake (C2) for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to give Blake an item that Blake wants, which may help in the next step.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the living room (R21) where Casey is located. This action is necessary for Blake to be able to interact with Casey.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) for the flowers (I1) with Casey (C3). This action is crucial because it allows Blake to obtain the flowers that Alex wants.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is the final step that ensures Alex gets what they want, making them happy.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
