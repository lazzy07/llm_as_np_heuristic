To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Jones, the first action will be to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding the symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, if he is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently there.

4. **Admit Ross to PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will admit Ross to PatientRoomC, where he can be assessed and treated.

5. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross with steroids**: If Ross is found to have a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, ensuring he becomes healthy.

7. **Walk back to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk back to the Admissions room to assess Young.

8. **Admit Young to PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will admit Young to PatientRoomA, where he can be assessed and treated.

9. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

10. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: If Young is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
