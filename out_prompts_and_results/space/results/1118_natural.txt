Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action is taken to find a safe location away from the dangerous surface. The cave is a secure place where they can avoid the potential eruption of the volcano.

2. **The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave**: As the guardian of the planet, the Lizard understands the need for safety and follows Zoe to ensure they both remain safe together.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave**: Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in a safe location strengthens their bond and ensures they can work together to face any future challenges.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave**: This action is implied as they remain in the cave, allowing the volcano to erupt without them being harmed. They are now safe and can enjoy each other's company.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard. They both find safety in the cave, away from the dangers of the surface.
