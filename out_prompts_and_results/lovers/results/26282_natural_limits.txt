In the living room, Blake realizes that they need to get the chocolates to be happy. Since Casey believes the chocolates are in the bathroom, Blake decides to tell Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom. This action is a lie, but it will prompt Casey to move to the bathroom in search of the chocolates, allowing Blake to keep the flowers and potentially trade them later.

**Story:**
Blake, feeling unhappy, looks at the flowers in their hands and thinks about how to get the chocolates. They turn to Casey and say, "The chocolates are in the bathroom." Casey, believing Blake, quickly moves to the bathroom to search for the chocolates, leaving Blake alone in the living room with the flowers.

1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom**: This action is necessary because it misleads Casey into leaving the living room, allowing Blake to keep the flowers without interference.
