The bandit, realizing that the guard is at the crossroads and the hero is at the market, decides to take action to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she can confront the merchant who has the medicine. 

Once at the market, the bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine from her. This action is successful because the merchant is not armed, and the bandit can take the item without any resistance. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit now has a valuable item that can be used for trade or leverage.

The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may acquire later. This action fulfills her goal of having valuable items in her possession.
