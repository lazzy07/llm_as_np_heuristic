In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Given the current situation, Alex is in the dining room (R22) and has not yet obtained the jewelry. Blake is in the living room (R21) and can see that Alex is unhappy. 

To help Alex, Blake can take the following action:

1. **move(Blake, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room to the dining room where Alex is located. This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the jewelry.

After this action, Blake can give Alex the jewelry, which will make both of them happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **move(Blake, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the dining room to be with Alex.

This single action allows Blake to be in the same room as Alex, setting up the opportunity for Blake to give Alex the jewelry in the next step, which would ultimately make both characters happy.
