To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who has already accepted her marriage proposal. Since Rory has the treasure, which is a valuable item, we can leverage that to make Talia happy and wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married. This action makes both characters happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Village)**: After the marriage, Talia can take the treasure from Rory, as they are now married and can share their possessions. This action makes Talia wealthy.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Rory) and wealthy (from acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action is crucial as it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage, which is a significant milestone for her.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Village)**: This action allows Talia to gain wealth by taking the treasure from Rory, thus achieving her goal of becoming wealthy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
