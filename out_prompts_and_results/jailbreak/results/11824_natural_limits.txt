Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that he has the knife, which gives him a chance to confront the bully. 

**Action:** Ernest moves from the kitchen to the gym and uses the knife to kill the bully.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary because it directly addresses the threat posed by the bully. By eliminating the bully, Ernest ensures that both he and Roy are no longer in danger. Additionally, this action allows Ernest to keep the pack of cigarettes, which he desires, as the bully will no longer be around to threaten him for them.

After killing the bully, Ernest can then return to Roy, and they can enjoy their newfound safety and the cigarettes together.
