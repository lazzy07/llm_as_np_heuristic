**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Ernest and Roy realize they need to act quickly to escape the bully's threats. Ernest, who has stolen the pack of cigarettes from the bully, knows that the bully will come after them once he finds out. 

1. **Action: lock_gym(Roy, Laundry)** - Roy decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them while they plan their next move. This action is crucial as it buys them time and keeps the bully at bay.

2. **Action: vent(Ernest, Highway)** - Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is necessary for him to escape the prison without being caught by the guards or the bully.

3. **Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)** - Once on the highway, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier to disguise himself and successfully escapes from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free from the bully's threats.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Locking the gym door prevents the bully from accessing them, allowing them to strategize without immediate danger.
- Crawling through the vents is a stealthy way to bypass the prison's security and reach the outside world.
- Escaping while disguised ensures that Ernest can evade capture and live freely, achieving his ultimate goal.
