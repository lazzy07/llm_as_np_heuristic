To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be out of the way to allow Alex to pick up the jewelry.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the living room (R22). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where Casey is. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the characters together and allows for potential future interactions.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where Casey and Blake are. This action allows Alex to be with the other characters after achieving their goal.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy. The other characters may still be unhappy, but the goal is to ensure Alex's happiness.
