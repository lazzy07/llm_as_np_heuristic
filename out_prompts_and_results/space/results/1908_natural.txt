Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcanic activity. To ensure their safety and health, they decide to find a safer location. 

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safe place away from the erupting surface. The cave is a secure location where they can avoid danger.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring that they remain together and can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and commitment to supporting each other in their quest for safety and health.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard explore the cave together.** - This action is implied as they are now in a safe location, allowing them to interact and learn more about each other, which helps them achieve their goal of making friends.

By taking these actions, Zoe and the Lizard successfully find a safe place away from the dangers of the surface, ensuring their health and safety while also strengthening their friendship.
