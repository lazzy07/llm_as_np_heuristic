**Story Completion:**

Ernest, holding the knife, decides to take a risk. He knows that Roy is in the gym with the bully, and he needs to ensure both of their safety. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, hoping to catch the bully off guard.

Once in the gym, Ernest sees Roy and the bully. The bully is distracted, thinking that Ernest is still in the hallway. Ernest seizes the moment and lunges at the bully with the knife, successfully killing him. With the bully out of the way, both Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened.

Now that the bully is dead, Ernest and Roy can search the gym for the pack of cigarettes. They find the cigarettes hidden in the bully's belongings. With their newfound freedom and the cigarettes in hand, they decide to escape the prison.
