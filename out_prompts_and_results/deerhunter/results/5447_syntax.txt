To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has some money. Bubba is greedy and wants to take the clerk's money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires without needing to shoot the clerk.
