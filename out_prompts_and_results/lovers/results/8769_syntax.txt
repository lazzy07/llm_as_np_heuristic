To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey (C3) moves to the dining room (R12)**: This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex (C1) to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **Blake (C2) tells Casey (C3) that Alex wants the chocolates (I2)**: This action is a lie, as Alex actually wants the flowers (I1). However, it creates a situation where Casey might feel compelled to help Alex, which is in line with their desire to make Blake happy.

3. **Casey (C3) moves to the living room (R21)**: This action allows Casey to be in the same room as Blake (C2), who has the jewelry (I3).

4. **Blake (C2) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3)**: This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Move (C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be near Alex to understand their needs.
- **Tell (C2, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake misleads Casey to create a sense of urgency to help Alex, which aligns with Casey's desire to make Blake happy.
- **Move (C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to be with Blake, who has the jewelry.
- **Give (C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
