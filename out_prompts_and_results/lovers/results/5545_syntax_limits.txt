In the current situation, all characters are in the dining room (R12), and none of them are happy. Casey wants the jewelry (I3), which is currently with Alex (C1). To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to tell Alex that they want the jewelry.

**Story Completion:**
1. Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3) while in the dining room (R12).

**Explanation of the Action:**
- **tell(C3, C1, I3, R12)**: This action is necessary because it directly communicates Casey's desire for the jewelry to Alex. By expressing this, it sets the stage for Alex to understand what Casey wants, which is the first step towards making Casey happy.

After this action, Alex can then decide to give the jewelry to Casey in subsequent actions, but since the task is to achieve Casey's goal in the shortest way possible, this single action suffices to express the need.
