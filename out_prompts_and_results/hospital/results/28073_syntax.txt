To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to assess and treat the patients based on their symptoms. Since we don't know the symptoms of Jones and Ross yet, we will first assess them. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC**: Next, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the identified symptoms. If Ross has Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomC**: Similarly, Hathaway treats Jones based on the identified symptoms. The same logic applies here as with Ross.

5. **Walk Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions**: After treating both patients, Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to check on Young.

6. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), Admissions**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young based on the identified symptoms.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Ross and Jones**: This is crucial to determine their symptoms and ensure they receive the correct treatment.
- **Treating Ross and Jones**: Based on the assessments, Hathaway will provide the appropriate treatment to make them healthy.
