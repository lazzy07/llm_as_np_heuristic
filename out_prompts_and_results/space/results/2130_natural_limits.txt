Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. Understanding the need for safety, Zoe suggests they work together to find a way to protect themselves and the planet. The Lizard, feeling a sense of camaraderie, agrees to help Zoe. They decide to teleport back to the spaceship to gather supplies that could help them in case of an emergency.

However, as they teleport to the spaceship, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. The eruption is so powerful that it causes a shockwave that stuns Zoe, leaving her vulnerable. The Lizard, witnessing this, rushes to help Zoe but is caught in the eruption's aftermath. 

In the chaos, Zoe manages to break free from the stun and realizes the Lizard is in danger. She quickly teleports back to the surface to save her friend. Unfortunately, the eruption is too severe, and the Lizard is unable to escape in time, resulting in the Lizard's demise.
