Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that her workload is too high to effectively assess and treat all patients. She decides to prioritize the patients in the admissions room, starting with Jones, who is still waiting for care.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is currently in the admissions room and has unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can now assess and treat him. This also reduces her workload by one.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to be present in the exam room where she can assess Jones.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This is the critical action where Dr. Hathaway can determine Jones's symptoms. Given that Jones is alive and healthy, she concludes that he is experiencing Flaze (fever) and treats him accordingly.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - Since Jones has Flaze, the treatment with antibiotics will make him healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring he is healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
