To complete the story and ensure that Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included to signify that Alex is returning to a personal space after receiving the item.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: This action allows Alex to reach the room where the other characters are, facilitating interaction.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is essential for Alex's happiness.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While this action does not affect Alex's happiness, it provides a narrative closure by returning to the bedroom.
