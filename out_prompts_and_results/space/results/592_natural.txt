Zoe realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the ongoing eruptions. To ensure her safety and the safety of her new friend, the Lizard, she decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can both be safe. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, their friendship and mutual desire for safety outweigh any potential conflict.
