**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room A with Ross and Jones. Since both patients are in the same room, Hathaway decides to assess them to determine their symptoms.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to see what symptoms he is showing. This action is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.
   
2. **Assess Jones**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway assesses Jones. This is also necessary to determine Jones's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Assuming Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Jones**: If Jones shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This ensures that both patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms.

After these actions, both Ross and Jones are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Ross and Jones is essential to identify their symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
- Treating Ross with antibiotics is necessary if he has Flaze, ensuring he recovers.
- Treating Jones with steroids is necessary if he has Jarkis, ensuring he recovers as well.
