To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in the room, but we know that Casey (C3) has the jewelry (I1) and is currently unhappy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to access the jewelry (I1) that is in the living room (R12).
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Blake.

2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Casey and the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.

3. **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake.
   - This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

4. **put_down(C2, I1, R12)**: Blake puts down the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R12).
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but can be included to show that Blake has the item.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to move to the dining room to access the jewelry.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: This is the key action that makes Blake happy by giving them the item they want.
- **put_down(C2, I1, R12)**: This action is optional but shows that Blake has the jewelry.
