To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, to achieve his goal of getting money, he needs to return to the bank and steal from the bank clerk, who has money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will allow him to regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where the bank clerk is, and where he can attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where the clerk is located.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
