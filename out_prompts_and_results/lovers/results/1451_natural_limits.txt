In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is happy with the jewelry. 

Blake, knowing that Casey has the jewelry and is happy, decides to take action to achieve their own happiness. Blake picks up the flowers from the living room and gives them to Alex. This action makes Alex happy, as they now have the flowers they wanted. 

However, Blake still needs to achieve their own happiness. Since Casey is happy with the jewelry, Blake decides to tell Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom, which is a lie.
