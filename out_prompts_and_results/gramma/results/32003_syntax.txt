To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves from the Crossroads to the Market to confront the Merchant and take the coins she has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins she has. This action is possible because the Merchant is unarmed and the Bandit is armed.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks back to the Crossroads with the coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit takes the coins she just acquired and places them in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to interact with the Merchant.
- Robbing the Merchant is a direct way to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as the Merchant is not armed.
- Walking back to the Crossroads is necessary to return to a safe location where the Bandit can store her loot.
- Taking the coins to the chest at the bandit camp fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins secured.
