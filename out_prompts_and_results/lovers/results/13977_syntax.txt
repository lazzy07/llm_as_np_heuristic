To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially trade or receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to have an item, which may help in future trades or interactions.

3. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R12)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) they just received from Alex for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This is the key action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry (I3), which is what they wanted.
