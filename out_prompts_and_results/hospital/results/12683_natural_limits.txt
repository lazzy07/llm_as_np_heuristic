Dr. Hathaway, overwhelmed with a workload of three, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. She mistakenly believes that Jones is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis due to her high workload. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. However, due to her workload, she misdiagnoses him with Jarkis instead of recognizing his actual condition.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with steroids.**  
   - Explanation: Since Dr. Hathaway believes Jones has Jarkis, she administers the incorrect treatment (steroids). However, since Jones is actually healthy and not suffering from either disease, he remains alive and healthy.

3. **Action: Jones walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - Explanation: After being treated, Jones moves to Admissions, where he can confirm his health status and express his desire to be alive and healthy.
