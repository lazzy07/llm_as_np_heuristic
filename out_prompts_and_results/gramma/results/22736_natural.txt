To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in her preferred location, where she can interact with the guard and potentially sell items.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to be at the crossroads to maintain his presence and ensure he can monitor the situation, especially since he believes the merchant has the medicine.

3. **The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit needs to approach the crossroads to potentially confront the merchant and acquire the medicine, which she believes the merchant has.

4. **The bandit attacks the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, armed with a sword, can attack the merchant to steal the hero's coin. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

5. **The bandit loots the coin from the merchant's corpse.**  
   - After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit can loot the coin, which directly contributes to her goal of having coins.

6. **The bandit walks back to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit returns to her camp with the stolen coin, ensuring her safety and securing her loot.

7. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the authorities.**  
   - The guard, believing the bandit is a criminal, takes action to report her, which aligns with his goal of eliminating crime.

In this sequence, the merchant's goal is achieved indirectly through the bandit's actions, as the bandit steals the coin from the merchant, allowing the merchant to have a clear path to profit without being labeled a criminal herself.
