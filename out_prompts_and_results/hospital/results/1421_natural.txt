**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to assess Jones, who is in Patient Room B. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway's workload remains at 2, and she does not make a mistake in her assessment. 

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Jones is experiencing symptoms consistent with Flaze (fever). She then treats Jones with antibiotics, which successfully makes Jones healthy.

Meanwhile, Ross remains in Admissions, and Young is also in Admissions. They are not yet assigned to any exam rooms, but since Jones has already achieved their goal of becoming healthy, the story can conclude here.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After determining that Jones has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats him with the appropriate medication, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.
