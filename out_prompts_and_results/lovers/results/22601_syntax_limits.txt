In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Casey achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R12)**: Casey (C3) can trade the chocolates (I1) they have with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:

- Blake will have the chocolates (I1), which is not what Blake wants, but since Casey is happy, Blake's happiness is secondary to Casey's goal.

This single action is sufficient for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
