To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army needs to travel to Tanis to confront Indiana Jones and retrieve the Ark from the Nazis. This action is necessary for the US Army to be in the same location as the Ark.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, USA)**: Once the US Army arrives in Tanis, they can take the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is crucial because the Nazis currently possess the Ark, and the US Army needs to acquire it.

3. **status(Nazis) = Dead**: The Nazis are dead because they opened the Ark, which was dangerous. This is a consequence of their previous action and ensures they can no longer pose a threat.

4. **status(USArmy) = Alive**: The US Army remains alive after taking the Ark, allowing them to keep it and fulfill their goal.

By following these actions, the US Army successfully obtains the Ark, and the Nazis are eliminated due to their own actions.
