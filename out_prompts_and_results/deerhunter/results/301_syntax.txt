To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome. Bubba successfully gets the money by eliminating the bank clerk, and Bambi remains alive since she is not directly involved in this sequence of events.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, House, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also adhering to the constraints of the story.
