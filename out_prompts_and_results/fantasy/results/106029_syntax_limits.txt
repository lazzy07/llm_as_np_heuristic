In the cave, Gargax, the dragon, is feeling hungry and desires wealth. Talia, a human, has just picked up a treasure and is unaware of Gargax's intentions. Rory, another human, is also present but has no treasure. Vince, who was previously alive, has been eaten by Gargax, leaving behind some money.

To achieve Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy and not hungry, the dragon will take the following actions:

1. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax will take the money from Vince's dead body. This action allows Gargax to gain wealth without any resistance since Vince is no longer alive.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax will eat Rory, who is still alive. This action will satisfy Gargax's hunger, ensuring that he is no longer hungry.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved his goals of being wealthy (by acquiring the money) and not hungry (by eating Rory).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to gain wealth. Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money without any conflict.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action is essential for Gargax to satisfy his hunger. By eating Rory, Gargax ensures he is no longer hungry.
