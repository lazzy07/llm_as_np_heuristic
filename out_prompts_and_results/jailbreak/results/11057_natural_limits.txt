Ernest, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's survival. He has the knife, and he understands that the only way to eliminate the threat is to confront the bully directly. 

Ernest takes a deep breath, grips the knife tightly, and lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. In a swift motion, he stabs the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten either him or Roy. With the bully incapacitated, Ernest feels a rush of relief. He knows that he has secured their safety for the time being.

Now, with the bully out of the way, Ernest can focus on escaping. He unlocks the gym door and heads back to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Once disguised, he makes his way to the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
