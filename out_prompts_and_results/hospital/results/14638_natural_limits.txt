Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. Since Dr. Hathaway is currently at Patient Room B, they first assess Jones, who is in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers that he is experiencing a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to understand Jones's condition and provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room C, preparing to assess and treat him next. This action is necessary to ensure that Young also receives the care he needs, contributing to the overall goal of patient health.

After these actions, both Jones and Young are on the path to recovery, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
