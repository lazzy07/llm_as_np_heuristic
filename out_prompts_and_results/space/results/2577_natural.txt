Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and wanting to maintain their friendship, follows her to the spaceship.

2. **The Lizard teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to maintain their friendship and ensure both characters are safe.
