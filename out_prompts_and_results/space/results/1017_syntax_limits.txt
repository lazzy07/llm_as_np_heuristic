In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to be on the surface where the volcano is erupting, which is crucial for the story's climax.

2. **The volcano erupts**: This action will lead to the death of Zoe, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

3. **The Lizard, witnessing the eruption and Zoe's demise, feels a sense of loss and decides to make peace with Zoe**: This action represents the Lizard's change of heart, as it realizes the importance of friendship and connection, even in the face of tragedy.

The story concludes with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard's feelings evolve, leading to a friendship that transcends the unfortunate event.
