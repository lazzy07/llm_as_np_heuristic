To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is necessary:

1. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels from the Cave to the Village. This action is essential because it allows Vince to return to the Village where he can potentially find food and be in a place where he can be happy. Since he already has money, he can use it to buy food in the Village, thus satisfying his hunger.

This single action is sufficient for Vince to achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: By moving to the Village, Vince can access resources (like food) that will help him not be hungry. Since he already has money, he can use it to buy food, which will contribute to his happiness as well.
