Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to make peace with the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship that could help both of them survive. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to work together for their mutual safety. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's sincerity, agrees to put aside their differences and they become friends. 

However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. In the chaos, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and tragically dies, while Zoe manages to teleport back to the spaceship just in time to escape the disaster.
