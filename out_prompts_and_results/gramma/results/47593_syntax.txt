To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom at the crossroads to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, who is unarmed. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to take the coin Tom is carrying, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the bandit walks to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to store the coins in the chest at the camp, ensuring that she achieves her goal of having coins secured.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal by the end of these actions.
