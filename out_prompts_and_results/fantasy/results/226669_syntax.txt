To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia is currently in the Cave, where the Treasure is located. By picking up the Treasure, she will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the Treasure, Talia will travel back to the Village. This is necessary because she needs to be in the Village to interact with Vince and finalize her relationship with him.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia will marry Vince. Since she has already accepted his proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.

4. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince will become hungry. This action is included to ensure that Vince's hunger is addressed, as he wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry.

5. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax, who is in the Cave, will eat Vince. This action is included to create a scenario where Talia can achieve her goal of being wealthy without Vince being alive, as she will inherit his wealth (the Money).

6. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia will take the Money from Vince's dead body in the Village. This action allows Talia to become wealthy by acquiring the Money that Vince had.

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring both the Treasure and Money).
