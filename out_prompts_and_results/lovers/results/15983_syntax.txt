To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any character's possession, and it is believed to be in the bathroom (R12). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to retrieve the jewelry (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Casey believes the jewelry is in the bathroom and needs to go there to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the bathroom.
   - This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants.

   - This action is needed to bring the jewelry back to where Blake and Alex are, facilitating the next step.
