**Story Completion:**

On Day 2, Roy is in the gym with the bully, who is currently preoccupied with his workout. Knowing that the bully is a threat, Roy decides to take action. He quickly looks around and spots the knife in the kitchen, which he knows he needs to get to defend himself and Ernest.

1. **Action: vent(Roy, Gym)** - Roy crawls through the vents to reach the kitchen, where he can find the knife. This action is necessary for Roy to obtain a weapon to protect himself and Ernest from the bully's threats.

2. **Action: kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)** - After retrieving the knife, Roy returns to the gym and confronts the bully. In a moment of desperation and self-defense, he uses the knife to kill the bully. This action is crucial as it eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.

With the bully dead, Roy is no longer threatened, and he can now focus on escaping or helping Ernest. However, the story ends here with Roy overcoming the bully's threats.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of venting to the kitchen is essential for Roy to acquire the knife, which is the only means of defense against the bully.
- The second action of killing the bully is a direct response to the threat posed by him. By eliminating the bully, Roy secures his safety and that of his friend, Ernest.
