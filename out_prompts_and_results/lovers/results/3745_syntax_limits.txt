In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want the item I3 (flowers), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want the item I2 (chocolates). 

To ensure Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want (I3 - flowers).

This single action is sufficient to achieve Alex's goal of making Casey happy, as it directly addresses Casey's desire.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: This action is necessary because it allows Alex to fulfill Casey's desire for flowers, thus making Casey happy. Since Alex is already happy with the jewelry, this action aligns with Alex's goal of ensuring the happiness of others.
