Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, establishing a friendly relationship. To ensure their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and ensure that both she and the Lizard remain safe from the eruption.

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken by Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensure her safety. It also demonstrates her trust in the Lizard, as she is leaving him on the surface while she goes to a safer location.

After this action, Zoe is safe on her spaceship, and the Lizard remains on the surface, but they have established a friendship that can lead to future interactions.
