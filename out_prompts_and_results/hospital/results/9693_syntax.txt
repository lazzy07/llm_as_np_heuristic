To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Ross's condition will help Hathaway decide on the appropriate treatment for him.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This is crucial for ensuring Ross's health, which indirectly supports Young's goal since they are in the same room.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, so he can receive the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This is the most critical action to ensure Young becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is taken to identify Ross's symptoms, which is essential for his treatment.
2. **Treat Ross**: This action is taken to ensure Ross becomes healthy, which is important for the overall health of the patients in the room.
3. **Assess Young**: This action is taken to identify Young's symptoms, which is essential for his treatment.
4. **Treat Young**: This action is taken to ensure Young becomes healthy, achieving his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that both Ross and Young are assessed and treated correctly, leading to Young achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
