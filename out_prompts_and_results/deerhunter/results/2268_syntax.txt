To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially obtain money indirectly by using the rifle.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the Forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which is a step towards fulfilling his greed for money, as he can then take Bambi's body to eat or use it as leverage.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger while also allowing him to gain energy to continue pursuing his goal.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will return to the Bank. This action is necessary to return to the location where the Clerk is, as Bubba needs to confront the Clerk to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will steal the money from the Clerk while holding the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money directly from the Clerk.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger, eliminates a potential threat (Bambi), and ultimately steals money from the Clerk, fulfilling his greedy desires.
