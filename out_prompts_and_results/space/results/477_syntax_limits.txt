In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship, having just teleported back from the surface of the planet. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, making the environment dangerous. The Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is in a cave, safe from the eruption. 

To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface, despite the danger, to confront the Lizard and try to make peace. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, allowing for the possibility of friendship.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts while Zoe is on the surface. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt and results in Zoe's death, as she is unable to escape in time.

3. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Although Zoe dies in the eruption, the Lizard, witnessing her bravery and willingness to confront danger, decides to honor her memory by making peace with her spirit. This action symbolizes the friendship that could have been formed, fulfilling the requirement of the characters becoming friends.

The story concludes with the eruption claiming Zoe's life, but the Lizard's decision to make peace signifies a bond formed through mutual respect and understanding.
