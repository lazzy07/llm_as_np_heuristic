To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom bought from her. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count without being attacked, as the Merchant is not armed with a sword.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coin that Tom had just bought. This action is crucial for the Bandit to increase her coin count without facing any resistance since the Merchant is unarmed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins in the chest. This action is necessary for the Bandit to fulfill her goal of having coins secured in her camp.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by acquiring the coin and moving to a safe location to store it.
