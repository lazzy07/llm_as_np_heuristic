In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire some money and treasure while ensuring he is not hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. Gargax, who is at the cave with Talia and Vince, sees that Talia has the treasure. Gargax, wanting to be wealthy and not hungry, decides to eat Vince, who is also at the cave. This action eliminates Vince, allowing Gargax to satisfy his hunger and gain wealth from the treasure Vince had (the money).
2. After eating Vince, Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body, which increases Gargax's wealth but leaves Rory without a competitor for Talia's treasure.
3. Rory, who is at the village, travels to the cave to reunite with Talia. Upon arrival, Rory finds Talia and realizes that she has the treasure. Since Talia is now the only one left, Rory proposes to Talia, and she accepts, making them both happy.
