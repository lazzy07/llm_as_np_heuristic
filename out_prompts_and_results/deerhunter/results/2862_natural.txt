To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also alive in the forest, which presents an opportunity for Bubba to take action.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This will also eliminate Bambi, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary to actually kill Bambi, allowing Bubba to eat her and satisfy his hunger.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba will want to eat her to satisfy his hunger.

4. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, and since Bambi is now dead, it also meets the condition of having Bambi dead.

5. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located to potentially take the money.

6. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead.
