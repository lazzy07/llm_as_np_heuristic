To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey wants to be happy and needs to be in a position to interact with Blake.

2. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to be closer to Casey and Blake. This is important for Alex to communicate and potentially trade items.

3. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R21)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Casey of their desire, which may lead to a trade or a gift.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room where Blake is located. This is necessary for Casey to communicate with Blake about the items they have.

5. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie since Casey actually wants the flowers (I1), but it may lead to a trade that benefits Alex.

6. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to be closer to Casey and to potentially trade items.

7. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake for the flowers (I1). This is the crucial action that allows Alex to finally get the item they want.

8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex has the item they desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is their desired item.
