**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to help Ernest and escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.

Next, Roy decides to sneak back through the vent to the gym. He knows that the gym door is locked, but he needs to ensure Ernest is safe from the bully. Once he arrives at the gym, he finds the door locked, but he can hear the bully threatening Ernest inside. 

Roy then uses his knowledge of the prison layout to find a way to unlock the gym door from the outside. He manages to unlock it, allowing him to enter. This action is necessary to confront the bully and protect Ernest.

Once inside, Roy sees the bully looming over Ernest. In a moment of bravery, Roy grabs the knife from his pocket (which he had hidden in his civilian clothes) and confronts the bully. He knows that this is the only way to ensure both he and Ernest can escape without further threats. 

In a swift motion, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer in danger. With the bully out of the way, Roy and Ernest can now escape together. They quickly make their way back to the hallway, where they can exit through the highway.

Finally, they both put on the civilian clothes to disguise themselves and step out onto the highway, successfully escaping the prison. This ending fulfills both of their goals of staying alive and avoiding threats.
