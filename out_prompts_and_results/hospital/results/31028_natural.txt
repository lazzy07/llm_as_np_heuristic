**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** 
   - Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. Young becomes healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.** 
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is still in Admissions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** 
   - Assuming Jones has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the correct treatment. Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C.** 
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room C.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** 
   - Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. Ross becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Young, Jones, and Ross—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each assessment is crucial to identify the symptoms of the patients.
- Each treatment is based on the assumption of the symptoms identified, ensuring that the correct treatment is administered.
