Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway's workload remains at 2, and he does not make a mistake in diagnosing Jones. After assessing, Hathaway realizes that Jones is not showing any symptoms of Flaze or Jarkis, so he treats Jones with the appropriate antibiotics for Flaze, which is the only treatment he can administer based on his knowledge. This treatment is incorrect, but since Jones is not actually suffering from either disease, he remains alive and healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to, and it keeps Hathaway's workload manageable.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Assess Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms.
2. Walk to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B.

These actions ensure that Dr. Hathaway is actively working towards the health of his patients, fulfilling his goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
