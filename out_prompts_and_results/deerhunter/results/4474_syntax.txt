To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead (or both). Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank with the clerk, and he is hungry. The clerk has money, and Bubba is greedy, which means he wants to take the money from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is included to show that Bubba is addressing his hunger, which is a part of his character's needs.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will then leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is included to show that he is moving to a different location, possibly to hide or consume the food he has taken.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, who is already dead. This action is included to show that Bubba is fulfilling his hunger by consuming the deer.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba takes the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger, which is a natural response after stealing.
- **go**: Bubba moves to the forest, indicating a change in location after the theft.
- **eat**: Bubba consumes Bambi, fulfilling his hunger and ensuring that Bambi is dead.

With these actions, we achieve the goal of Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.
