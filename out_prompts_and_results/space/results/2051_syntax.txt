To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface, where the volcano is about to erupt. This action is crucial as it places her in the location where the eruption will occur.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface, where Zoe is. This action is important because it brings both characters together in the same location, allowing for potential interaction.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace with each other. This action is essential for them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is the final action that leads to the death of one character. Since Zoe is on the surface when the eruption occurs, she will die.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing her to become friends with the Lizard before the eruption.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt**: Starts the volcanic eruption, creating a dangerous situation.
- **teleport_from_ship**: Brings Zoe to the surface where the eruption will happen.
- **walk**: Moves the Lizard to the surface, allowing interaction.
- **make_peace**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
- **erupt**: Causes the volcano to erupt, leading to Zoe's death.
