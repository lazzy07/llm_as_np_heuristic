In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and a character dies, we can have the following actions:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation on the surface.
2. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The eruption kills Zoe, who is on the surface when the volcano erupts.

This sequence of actions leads to Zoe's death due to the eruption while also maintaining the relationship between Zoe and the Lizard as friends, as they were not fighting at the time of the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of the volcano erupting, which is a key part of the story's ending.
- **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: This action results in Zoe's death, which is another condition for the story's ending.
