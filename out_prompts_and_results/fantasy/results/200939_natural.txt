To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Talia is at the cave, and Gargax wants to eat a human. By eating Talia, Gargax will become wealthy (by taking Talia's wealth) and not hungry, which aligns with Gargax's goals. 

2. **Rory takes the treasure from Talia's dead body**: After Gargax eats Talia, Rory can take the treasure from Talia's body. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy, as he currently has the treasure but needs to ensure he has the wealth associated with it.

3. **Rory proposes to Vince**: Rory, now wealthy and wanting to be happy, proposes to Vince. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve happiness through marriage.

4. **Vince accepts Rory's proposal**: Vince accepts the proposal, which leads to both characters being happy.

5. **Rory and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies Rory's happiness through marriage with Vince.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Gargax eats Talia (to fulfill Gargax's hunger and wealth goals).
- Rory takes the treasure from Talia's dead body (to achieve wealth).
- Rory proposes to Vince (to achieve happiness).
- Vince accepts Rory's proposal (to achieve happiness).
- Rory and Vince get married (to solidify their happiness).

### Explanation of Each Action:

- **Rory takes the treasure from Talia's dead body**: This action is crucial for Rory to gain wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
- **Rory proposes to Vince**: Proposing is a step towards achieving happiness, as Rory desires a loving relationship.
