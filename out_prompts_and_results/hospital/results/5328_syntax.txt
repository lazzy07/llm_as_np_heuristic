To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is important to determine Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment as well. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Jones becomes healthy.
