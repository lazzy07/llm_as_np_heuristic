In this story, Rory is in the cave and wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Talia is in the village and has a relationship with Rory, having accepted his proposal. Gargax, the dragon, is in the village and has just eaten Vince, who had the money. 

To achieve Rory's goal, he needs to acquire wealth and ensure he is not hungry. The quickest way for Rory to achieve this is to travel to the village, where he can take the money from Vince's dead body, as he is the only character with wealth at this point.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the cave to the village to reach the location where the money is located.
2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body, thus achieving his goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Rory will have the money, which fulfills his desire to be wealthy, and since he is not hungry (as he has not taken any actions that would make him hungry), he achieves his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel**: This action is necessary for Rory to reach the location where the money is located.
- **take**: This action allows Rory to acquire the money, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of wealth.
