To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant and that the Nazis are eliminated. Given the current situation, the Nazis are already dead after opening the Ark, which was dangerous. Therefore, the US Army now has the Ark, and Indiana Jones has successfully given it to them. 

Here’s the sequence of actions and their explanations:

1. **No further actions are needed**: The Nazis are already dead after opening the Ark, and the US Army has the Ark. Indiana Jones has already given the Ark to the US Army, fulfilling the requirement that the US Army has the Ark and the Nazis are dead.

The story concludes with the US Army in possession of the Ark and the Nazis eliminated, achieving the desired ending without any additional actions.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": []
}
``` 

This indicates that no further actions are necessary since the story has already reached the desired conclusion.
