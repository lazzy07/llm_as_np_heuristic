To complete the story and ensure that Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey, who currently has the jewelry (I3) and wants the chocolates (I2), can trade with Blake, who has the chocolates and wants the jewelry. This action allows both characters to achieve their goals. After this trade, Casey will have the chocolates, and Blake will have the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake can then give the chocolates (I2) to Alex, who wants the chocolates as well. This action ensures that Alex is happy, which is also a goal for Blake.

3. **give(C1, I1, C3, R21)**: Finally, Alex can give the flowers (I1) to Casey, who wants the jewelry (I3). This action ensures that Casey is happy as well.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry (I2), which makes Blake happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Trade**: This action is necessary for both Casey and Blake to achieve their goals simultaneously. It allows them to swap items they want.
- **Give**: This action allows Blake to ensure Alex is happy, which is part of Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy.
- **Give**: This action allows Alex to ensure Casey is happy, which indirectly supports Blake's goal of making Alex happy.
