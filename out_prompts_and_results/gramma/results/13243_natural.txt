**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, who is at the cottage with the medicine, decides to walk to the crossroads to meet the hero. This action is necessary because the merchant needs to be in a location where she can interact with the hero and potentially sell the medicine.

2. The merchant arrives at the crossroads and sees the hero. She offers to sell the medicine to the hero for one coin. The hero, believing he has a coin, agrees to buy the medicine. This action is crucial for the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

3. The hero hands over the coin to the merchant in exchange for the medicine. This action allows the merchant to gain a coin, fulfilling her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.

4. The merchant, now satisfied with her transaction, decides to walk back to the cottage. This action is not strictly necessary for her goal but allows her to return to her preferred location.
