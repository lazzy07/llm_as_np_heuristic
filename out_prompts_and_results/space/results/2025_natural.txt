Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is taken to seek shelter from the impending eruption. The cave is a safer location compared to the surface, where the volcano could erupt at any moment.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, as it also seeks safety from the dangerous surface. This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of staying safe.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave.** - Although they are already friends, this action solidifies their bond and ensures that they remain allies in the face of danger. It emphasizes their shared goal of health and safety.

4. **The volcano erupts on the surface.** - This event occurs after both characters have safely reached the cave, ensuring that they are not harmed by the eruption. 

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
