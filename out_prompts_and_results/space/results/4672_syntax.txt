To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Since they are currently on the surface, which is dangerous, Zoe should take actions that will help them both to a safer location while also fostering their relationship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is already taken, establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for both characters to feel safe and to work together.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard. This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the dangerous surface.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe place.

4. **begin_erupt(Cave)**: The volcano begins to erupt, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

5. **erupt(Cave)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, they remain unharmed.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
