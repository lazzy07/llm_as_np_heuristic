To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, we also need to ensure that Bubba can secure the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the bank where the clerk is located. He needs to be at the same location as the clerk to take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk using the rifle he has. Since he has already shot Bambi, he is in a position of power and can easily intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is already dead, thus achieving the story's goal.
