To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will result in a character dying. Since Zoe and the Lizard are already friends, we can focus on the actions that will lead to the volcano erupting and ultimately result in one of the characters dying.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the dangerous surface where the volcano can erupt.
2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** - This event is triggered by the narrative and leads to the next action.
3. **Zoe dies.** - Since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she cannot escape, resulting in her death.

This sequence of actions fulfills the requirement of having a character die and also leads to the volcano erupting, which is a significant event in the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface:** This action is crucial as it places Zoe in the location where the volcano can erupt, setting the stage for the next events.
- **The volcano on the surface erupts:** This is a necessary event that occurs after Zoe is on the surface, leading to the climax of the story.
- **Zoe dies:** This is the final outcome of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
