To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the Forest to the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk. This action fulfills Bubba's greed and ensures he has the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, achieving the goal of the story.
