Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to be in the same room as Young to assess their condition.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Young has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for the rash symptom.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Ross next, ensuring all patients are attended to.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring they are healthy. The story is kept concise while achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
