In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is not happy because they want item I1 (jewelry), which is with Casey. Casey is happy because they have item I3 (chocolates). 

To achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade item I2 (flowers) with Casey for item I1 (jewelry). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to receive the item they want, thus making them happy.

After the trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I2) and will still be happy with the chocolates (I3).
- Blake will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy because they helped Alex.

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.
