**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B to reduce the number of patients in Admissions. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A to assess Ross. Upon entering, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.
