In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to secure wealth and happiness through her relationships and the items she possesses. 

1. **Action: travel(Rory, Cave, Village)** - Rory travels back to the Village to retrieve the Money that he has. This is necessary because Talia needs to be wealthy, and Rory has the Treasure but not the Money. 

2. **Action: marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)** - Talia and Rory get married in the Cave. Since Rory has accepted Talia's proposal, this action will make both of them happy. Additionally, with Rory's Treasure and the Money he retrieves, Talia will achieve her goal of being wealthy.

By marrying Rory, Talia not only secures her happiness but also aligns herself with Rory's wealth, thus achieving her goal of being wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan is efficient and directly leads to Talia achieving her goals with minimal actions.
