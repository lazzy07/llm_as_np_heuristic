3. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C and observes Unknown.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Fever in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary because Young is showing symptoms of Fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is required for Hathaway to move to the Admissions area to admit another patient, Jones, to an exam room.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - Admitting Jones to an exam room is essential for Hathaway to assess and treat him. Since Jones is currently in Admissions, he needs to be assigned to a room.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C and observes Unknown.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition. Although the symptom is unknown, Hathaway needs to assess him to proceed with treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis in Patient Room C.**  
   - Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway assumes he might have Jarkis (the only other disease). Treating him with steroids is a risk, but it is necessary to attempt to ensure Jones's health.
