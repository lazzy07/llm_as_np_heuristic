To ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom.** (Blake wants to mislead Casey into thinking the chocolates are nearby, hoping to distract her from her own goal.)
2. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Casey believes Blake's lie and goes to check for the chocolates.)
3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the dining room.** (Blake is now free to search for the chocolates without Casey around.)
4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (Blake finds the chocolates, achieving their goal of happiness.)

At this point, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, while Alex remains unhappy because they still want the flowers, and Casey is happy with the jewelry.
