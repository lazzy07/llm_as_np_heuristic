In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure, which is believed to be in the cave, and ensure that he is not hungry. 

Here's the shortest story where Rory achieves his goal:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** (This action is necessary because Vince has the money and believes the treasure is at the cave. By traveling to the cave, he can potentially find the treasure.)
2. **Vince picks up the treasure in the cave.** (This action is necessary for Vince to acquire the treasure, which he believes is at the cave.)
3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (This action allows Vince to return to the village with the treasure.)
4. **Vince gives the treasure to Rory.** (This action is necessary for Rory to become wealthy, as he needs the treasure to achieve his goal.)
5. **Rory's happiness increases.** (Rory is now wealthy and not hungry, fulfilling his goal.)

By following these actions, Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
