To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey is already happy with the chocolates (I3), and Alex is unhappy because they want the flowers (I1). 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to check for the item they want (I2).
   - This action is necessary for Casey to potentially find the jewelry.

2. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to follow Casey.
   - Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room.
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is necessary for Blake's happiness.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex.
   - This action allows Alex to receive the item that Blake wants, thus helping Blake achieve their goal.

5. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) with the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake to give them the item.

6. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake.
   - This final action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry (I2), fulfilling their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the transfer of the jewelry from Casey to Blake through Alex, ensuring that all characters are in the correct locations to interact with each other and the items.
