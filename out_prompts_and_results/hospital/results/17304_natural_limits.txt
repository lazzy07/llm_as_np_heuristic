Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A, where Young is experiencing a rash. Since Dr. Hathaway believes Young has Jarkis, the appropriate treatment is steroids. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Young receives the correct treatment and to reduce the workload, Dr. Hathaway decides to first assess Ross and Jones, who are both in the admissions room.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions**: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the other patients, which will help reduce the workload and avoid mistakes in treatment.
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross**: This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. If Ross has a fever, he may have Flaze, and if he has a rash, he may have Jarkis. This assessment is crucial to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can treat Ross correctly.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones**: Similar to assessing Ross, this action helps Dr. Hathaway understand Jones's condition. Knowing both patients' symptoms will help in managing the workload and ensuring that all patients receive the correct treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A and treats Young with steroids**: After assessing both Ross and Jones, Dr. Hathaway can confidently treat Young for Jarkis, as Young is experiencing a rash. This action is essential for achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that all patients are on the path to recovery.
