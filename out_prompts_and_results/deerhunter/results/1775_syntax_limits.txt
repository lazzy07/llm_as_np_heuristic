After stealing the rifle from the bank clerk, Bubba decides to take advantage of the situation. He is hungry and has a goal of acquiring more money. Since he has already shot Bambi, he can eat the deer to satisfy his hunger. 

Bubba goes back to the forest where Bambi's body is located and eats the deer. This action fulfills his hunger and allows him to focus on his greed for money without the distraction of needing to eat.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba goes back to the forest to eat Bambi, which he has already killed. This action is necessary for him to satisfy his hunger.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which fulfills his hunger and allows him to continue pursuing his goal of acquiring more money.

This story is short and direct, focusing on Bubba's immediate needs and goals.
