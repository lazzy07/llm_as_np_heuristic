With a newfound determination, she approaches the Lizard and suggests they work together to find a safe place away from the volcano.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe initiates a conversation with the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it strengthens their relationship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe to the cave. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters are now in a safe location.

By the end of these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard have achieved their goals of being healthy and safe, and they have established a friendship.
