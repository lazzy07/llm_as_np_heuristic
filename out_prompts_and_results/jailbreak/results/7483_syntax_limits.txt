**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife hidden away. He quickly moves to the hallway, where he can access the gym. 

Once in the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot escape and will be vulnerable. 

With the gym door locked, Ernest confronts the bully. He uses the knife he stole earlier to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Roy. 

Now that the bully is gone, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He can now enjoy the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully without fear of being threatened.
