In the current situation, Talia is in the cave and has the money she took from Vince. She wants to be happy and wealthy, and since she has already accepted Vince's proposal, she is in a relationship with him. However, Vince is dead, which means she cannot marry him. To achieve her goal of happiness and wealth, Talia needs to marry Rory, who is still alive and in the village.

The best action for Talia to take is to travel back to the village and propose to Rory. This will allow her to marry Rory, which will make her happy, and since she already has money, she will also be wealthy.
