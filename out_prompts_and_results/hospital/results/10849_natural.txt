**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A with Jones, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway is determined to help Jones. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies. 

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, feeling the pressure of the situation, walks to Admissions to assess the other patients, Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 3 again.

5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young.

8. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing the workload to 3.

9. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

10. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is not achieved, as all patients die due to misdiagnosis stemming from the high workload.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is necessary to attempt to diagnose and treat the patients, despite the increasing workload leading to mistakes.
- The assessments and treatments are critical steps in the medical process, even though they ultimately lead to tragic outcomes due to the misdiagnosis.
