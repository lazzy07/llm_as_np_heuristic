Zoe and the Lizard, having made peace and become friends, decide to explore the surface together. They walk around, enjoying the beauty of the planet and sharing stories about their respective worlds. However, as they explore, they notice the ground beginning to tremble beneath them, indicating that the volcano is becoming active.

Realizing the danger, Zoe suggests they teleport back to the spaceship for safety. The Lizard, however, feels a strong connection to the surface and wants to stay and protect it. They have a brief discussion about their differing views, but ultimately, they agree to stay together on the surface for a little longer, as they have just become friends and want to enjoy this moment.

Suddenly, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. In the chaos, Zoe tries to teleport to the spaceship, but the Lizard, wanting to protect her, attempts to stun her to prevent her from leaving. Unfortunately, the Lizard miscalculates and accidentally stuns itself instead. 

As the eruption intensifies, Zoe realizes she must act quickly. She teleports to the spaceship, leaving the Lizard behind. The Lizard, still stunned, is unable to escape the eruption and tragically dies in the lava flow.

This story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying, and two characters having made friends before the tragic event.
