To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the TomCoin. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly from Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is not armed.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the BanditCoin from her possession and place it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first robbing Tom to gain an additional coin and then securing that coin in her camp's chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom, who is unarmed, to take the TomCoin. This is essential for the Bandit to increase her wealth.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit then takes the TomCoin and places it in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that she has coins secured in her camp.

The Bandit now has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
