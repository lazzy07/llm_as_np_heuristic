In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want the item I3 (which is in the same room as Alex). To ensure that Casey becomes happy, Alex can give Casey the item I1, which will make Casey happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the item they want (I3), making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex remains happy with I1.
- Casey becomes happy because they now have I1.
- Blake (C2) is still unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills Alex's goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving the jewelry to Casey is the only necessary action to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy. Since Alex is already happy, this action fulfills both characters' desires without needing any further actions.
