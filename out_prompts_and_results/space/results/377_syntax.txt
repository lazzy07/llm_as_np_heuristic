Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware that the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard. 

To achieve her goal, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to find a safer place away from the erupting volcano and to further her relationship with the Lizard.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it ensures that both characters are no longer in conflict and can work together for their mutual safety.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship. This action is essential for her safety, as the surface is still dangerous due to the ongoing volcanic activity.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Surface)**: The Lizard, wanting to ensure Zoe's safety and to explore the spaceship, teleports to the ship. This action allows the Lizard to join Zoe in a safe environment.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe and the Lizard can further their friendship aboard the spaceship, ensuring that they are both healthy and safe. This action solidifies their bond and achieves Zoe's goal of making friends.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard.
