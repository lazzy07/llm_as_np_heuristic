In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the chocolates (I3) they received from Alex. Blake (C2) wants the flowers (I2) but is not happy because they do not have them. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action would be for Blake to give the flowers (I2) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, thus making them happy.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly satisfies Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they now have the flowers.
- Blake will not be happy because they no longer have the flowers.
- Casey will remain happy with the chocolates.

This action is the shortest and most effective way to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
