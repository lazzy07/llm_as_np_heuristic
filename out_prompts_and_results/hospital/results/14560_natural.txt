**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, realizes that she needs to act quickly to help her patients. She decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A first, despite her heavy workload.

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to confirm Ross's symptoms. Since Ross has a rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with steroids.**  
   - This treatment matches Ross's symptoms, and since it is the correct treatment for Jarkis, Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 2.**  
   - With the workload reduced, she can now safely assess another patient without the risk of making a mistake.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - Young is still in Admissions, so Dr. Hathaway needs to admit him to an exam room first. However, since Young is not yet assigned to a room, she cannot assess him yet.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - Since Jones is now in Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway assesses him and finds that he is experiencing unknown symptoms.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with antibiotics.**  
   - Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, this treatment is a precautionary measure to ensure he does not have Flaze. 

8. **Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 1.**  
   - With the workload reduced, she can now safely assess Young.

9. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

10. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
    - She finds that Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms.

11. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C with antibiotics.**  
    - This treatment is a precautionary measure to ensure he does not have Flaze.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Jones, ensuring they are healthy. Young, despite having unknown symptoms, is treated with antibiotics, which is a safe choice given the circumstances.
