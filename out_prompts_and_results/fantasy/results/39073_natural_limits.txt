In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but both are unhappy and lack wealth. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth. Vince, who has the money, is at the village and is not involved in the current situation at the cave. 

To achieve Talia's happiness or wealth, the following actions will take place:

1. Gargax, feeling hungry and wanting wealth, decides to eat Rory, who is at the cave. This action will eliminate Rory, leaving Talia alone with Gargax.
2. After eating Rory, Gargax will take the treasure that is at the cave. This will make Gargax wealthy, but it will also leave Talia with the opportunity to negotiate with Gargax for her happiness.

Since Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy, she can now propose to Gargax, who is now wealthy and may be willing to share his wealth in exchange for her companionship.

However, since the goal is to keep the story short and focused on Talia's happiness or wealth, we will stop after Gargax takes the treasure, as this action will lead to Talia's potential future happiness through negotiation.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because it removes Rory from the equation, allowing Talia to focus on her own goals without Rory's presence. It also aligns with Gargax's desire to not be hungry.
- **Gargax takes the treasure**: This action fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth, which could lead to a future interaction with Talia that may result in her happiness.
