**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Roy knows he has to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen, ready to confront the bully. 

With a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, surprised and unable to react in time, is overpowered by Roy. In a desperate struggle, Roy manages to stab the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten them. 

With the bully now incapacitated, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he must escape before the guards arrive. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. 

Roy then exits the gym, making his way to the hallway. He crawls through the vent again, this time heading towards the highway. Once outside, he confidently walks away from the prison, finally free.
