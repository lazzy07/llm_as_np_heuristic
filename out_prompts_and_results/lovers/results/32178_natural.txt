To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and Blake currently has it. By giving the jewelry to Casey, Blake helps both Casey and himself, as it allows Casey to be happy.

2. **Casey picks up the flowers.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Casey is aware of the flowers being with them, as they believe they have the flowers. However, this action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness since their goal is to obtain the jewelry.

3. **Blake picks up the chocolates.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Blake is happy as well, as he wants the chocolates. It also reinforces the idea that characters can achieve their goals simultaneously.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still in the bedroom and is not happy because they still do not have the flowers.
- Blake is in the dining room and is now happy because he has the chocolates.
- Casey is in the dining room and is now happy because they have the jewelry.

The story concludes with Casey achieving their goal of happiness.
