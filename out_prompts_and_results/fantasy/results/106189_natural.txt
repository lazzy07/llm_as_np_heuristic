To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to reach the location where the treasure is believed to be, as he has the money and needs to find the treasure to increase his wealth.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure in the cave.**  
   - This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which is essential for increasing his wealth. Since he believes the treasure is at the cave, this action is logical.

3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village with the treasure to share it with Rory and Talia, which will help Rory achieve his goal of being wealthy.

4. **Vince gives the treasure to Rory.**  
   - This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he receives the treasure from Vince. This is crucial for Rory to achieve his goal.

5. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure, Rory can now feel happy, fulfilling his goal of happiness.

6. **Rory becomes not hungry.**  
   - Since Rory is now wealthy, he can afford food, ensuring he is not hungry, which is another part of his goal.

By following these actions, Rory successfully achieves his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
