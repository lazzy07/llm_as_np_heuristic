To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to treat the patients based on their assigned rooms without assessing them first, as the symptoms are unknown.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. Therefore, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the assumption that he has Flaze (the first disease).
   
2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. Again, due to the workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. Hathaway will treat Young based on the assumption that he has Flaze.

4. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross.

6. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. Due to the workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. Hathaway will treat Ross based on the assumption that he has Flaze.

7. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By treating all patients with antibiotics, Hathaway ensures that all patients become healthy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing and treating each patient**: This is necessary to determine the correct treatment and ensure the patients' health.
- **Walking to Admissions**: This is necessary to reach Ross, who is currently in the admissions room.
- **Treating with antibiotics**: This is the treatment for Flaze, which is assumed for all patients due to the risk of misdiagnosis.
