To complete the story and ensure that Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). Currently, I2 is in the dining room (R12), and Blake is in the living room (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to bring the chocolates to Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake in the living room.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want, which will make them happy.
