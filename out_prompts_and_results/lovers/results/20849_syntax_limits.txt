In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are in the living room (R22). Casey (C3) has the jewelry (I3) that Alex gave them, and Blake (C2) is also in the living room but wants the chocolates (I2), which are in the bathroom (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the flowers from the living room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the living room.

After this action, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (the flowers).
