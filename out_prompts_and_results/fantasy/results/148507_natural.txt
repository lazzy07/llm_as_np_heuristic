To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Rory needs to acquire it to increase their wealth.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the village to interact with Vince, who has the money, and to ensure he is not hungry.

3. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.**  
   - Since Rory needs to be wealthy, he must take the money from Vince, who is now dead. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.

4. **Rory becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to show that Rory is now in a state of hunger, which is a necessary condition for the next action.

5. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action is included to fulfill the requirement that Rory must be dead to achieve the final state of happiness, wealth, and not being hungry.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved their goal of being happy (due to the wealth acquired), wealthy (having both the treasure and the money), and not hungry (as Gargax has eaten him, thus removing the state of hunger).

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.",
    "Rory travels from the cave to the village.",
    "Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.",
    "Rory becomes hungry.",
    "Gargax eats Rory."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Rory's goals are met, leading to the desired outcome.
