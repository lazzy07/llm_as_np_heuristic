Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous situation due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard. 

To achieve this, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the need for cooperation in the face of the erupting volcano. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the danger of the volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters remain safe.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures both characters are safe from the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions to move to safety.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also forming a friendship with the Lizard.
