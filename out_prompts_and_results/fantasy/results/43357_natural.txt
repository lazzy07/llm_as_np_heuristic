To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth, and the treasure is the only item that can provide her with wealth.

2. **Vince proposes to Talia.**

   - This action is also redundant but reinforces Talia's happiness as she feels loved and valued.

4. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Talia to gain the treasure, thus achieving her goal of wealth.

5. **Talia's happiness increases.**  
   - As a result of the actions taken, Talia's happiness increases due to her marriage and the acquisition of wealth.

- Vince picks up the treasure from the cave.
