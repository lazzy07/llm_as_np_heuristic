The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is present. The bandit knows that the guard is focused on the market and believes that the hero is still there. 

Upon arriving at the market, the bandit attacks the guard, who is unprepared for the sudden assault. The bandit successfully kills the guard, allowing her to loot the guard's sword and any coins he may have had. With the guard out of the way, the bandit now has the opportunity to return to the bandit camp with the medicine she stole from the hero and any coins she finds.

The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the medicine and any coins she has acquired. With the guard dead and the hero unaware of her actions, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can and having the medicine in her possession.
