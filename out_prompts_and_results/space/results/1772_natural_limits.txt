Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to leave the cave and head back to the spaceship together to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to leave the cave and assess the situation on the surface, even though it is dangerous.
2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of Zoe being on the surface, fulfilling the requirement for the volcano to erupt.
3. **Zoe dies.** - This is the outcome of the eruption, which leads to Zoe's demise.

In this story, the actions taken lead to the volcano erupting and Zoe dying, while the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard remains intact, as they were friends before the eruption.
