Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous due to the potential eruption of the volcano. They have already established a friendly relationship, which is crucial for both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

To ensure Zoe achieves her goal of safety and friendship, the following actions will be taken:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is not necessary since the eruption has already begun. Instead, we will focus on actions that help Zoe and the Lizard.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures they are not fighting. It is important for both characters to feel secure in their friendship.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is, ensuring they are in a safer location away from the danger of the volcano.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave, ensuring they are together in a safe place.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship, which is a safe location away from the danger of the volcano.

6. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: The Lizard will teleport to the spaceship as well, ensuring both characters are safe and together.

By following these actions, Zoe and the Lizard will achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
