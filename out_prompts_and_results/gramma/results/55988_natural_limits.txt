The bandit, armed with two swords, walks from the crossroads to the market. There, she sees the guard and decides to rob him. Since the guard is not armed, the bandit successfully takes the guard's sword. With this new weapon, the bandit now has three swords. She then walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely keep the medicine and her coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the guard and attempt to rob him.
2. **Bandit robs the guard**: The bandit takes advantage of the guard being unarmed to steal his sword, which increases her power and ability to carry out further actions.
3. **Bandit walks back to the crossroads**: After successfully robbing the guard, the bandit returns to a safer location where she can store her items.

By the end of these actions, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she now has the guard's sword and can secure her position.
