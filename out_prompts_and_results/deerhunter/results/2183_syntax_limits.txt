To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is in the forest with a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions of the ending.

2. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can decide to take the money from Bambi's body, assuming he believes that Bambi has money. This action ensures that Bubba ends up with money.

The story is short and direct, with only two actions needed to achieve the desired ending.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is necessary to eliminate Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending. Bubba has a loaded rifle and is in the same location as Bambi, making this action feasible.
  
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is included to ensure that Bubba ends up with money, fulfilling the second condition of the ending. It is assumed that Bubba believes he can find money on Bambi.
