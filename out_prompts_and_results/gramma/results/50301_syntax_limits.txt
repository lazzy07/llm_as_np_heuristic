To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Merchant, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is currently at the Cottage with the medicine. For Tom to achieve his goal, he needs to get the medicine from the Merchant. The Merchant will walk to the Crossroads, where Tom is currently located.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After the Merchant arrives at the Crossroads, Tom can then walk from the Crossroads back to the Cottage, carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the Cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows the Merchant to move to a location where Tom can interact with her. Since Tom cannot buy the medicine without the Merchant being at the Crossroads, this action is essential.
- The second action allows Tom to return to the Cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.
