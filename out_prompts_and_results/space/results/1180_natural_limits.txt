Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous and that the Lizard is in peril, decides to help the Lizard. She teleports from the ship to the surface to offer assistance. Upon arriving, she finds the Lizard struggling with the erupting volcano. Instead of fighting, Zoe extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to help and make friends.
