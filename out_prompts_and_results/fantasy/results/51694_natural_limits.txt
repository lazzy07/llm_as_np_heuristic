To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the village, and Rory is at the cave with the treasure. Since Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, she can leverage her relationships to achieve her goals.

### Actions:
1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary because Rory has the treasure, which can contribute to Talia's happiness or wealth. By traveling to the village, he can bring the treasure to Talia.

2. **Rory gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action is essential as it allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which will increase her wealth. Since Talia's goal is to be wealthy, this directly contributes to her achieving that goal.

### Explanation:
- The first action allows Rory to move to Talia's location, making it possible for him to interact with her and give her the treasure.
- The second action directly fulfills Talia's desire to be wealthy, as she now possesses the treasure that Rory had.

### Final Plan in JSON format:

{
  "plan": [
