In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (flowers) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has item I1, and Alex needs to obtain it. 

To achieve this, Alex can simply trade with Casey. Since Casey wants item I3 (jewelry) and Alex has item I1 (flowers), they can trade directly. This action will make Alex happy because they will receive the flowers they want.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I1) they have just received from Blake for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness. It directly addresses Alex's desire for flowers and allows for a mutual exchange that satisfies both characters.
