**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A. Since Ross is in Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. However, due to the high workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is currently in Patient Room B.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with steroids.**  
   - Since Dr. Hathaway misdiagnosed Ross, he treats him for Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies as a result.

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Jones, who is still in Admissions.

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - He identifies that Jones has Flaze.

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Admissions with antibiotics.**  
    - This treatment is correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

**Final Explanation:**
