To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent can take the following actions:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office. This is necessary because the mastermind is likely to be in the office, and the secret agent needs to confront them there.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the office. This action directly fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome with minimal steps.
