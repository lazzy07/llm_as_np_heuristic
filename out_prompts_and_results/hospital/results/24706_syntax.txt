To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway is currently in Exam Room B with Young. Since Young is assigned to this room, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Young, Hathaway needs to walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross. This is important because Ross is also a patient who needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

6. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
