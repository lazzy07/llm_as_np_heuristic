To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway should first admit Ross to an exam room. However, since Hathaway's workload is already at 3, they will make a mistake if they assess Ross. Therefore, we will skip the assessment and directly admit Ross to an exam room.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This will increase Hathaway's workload to 4, but it is necessary to ensure Ross is treated.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: Ross will walk from the admissions room to Exam Room B. This is necessary for Ross to be in the correct location for treatment.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C. Since Young is in the admissions room, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C first.

5. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure Young is treated.

6. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Young will walk from the admissions room to Exam Room C.

7. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones is already in Exam Room A, this action is straightforward.

8. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Since Jones has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Jones with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Jones healthy.

9. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics, as Young is showing symptoms of Flaze. This will make Young healthy.

10. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids, as Ross is showing symptoms of Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy.

By following these steps, all patients will be treated correctly, and Hathaway will achieve their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
