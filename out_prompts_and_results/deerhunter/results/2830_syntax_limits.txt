Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, is in the forest with a loaded rifle. He spots Bambi, the deer, and decides to take advantage of the situation. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, as he has decided to eat.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, fulfilling his hunger and allowing him to continue his day.

With these two actions, Bubba achieves his goal of satisfying his hunger while also being in a position to potentially gather more money later if he chooses to sell the meat.
