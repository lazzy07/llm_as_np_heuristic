To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is hungry and has a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi, the deer. This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer, satisfying his hunger. This action does not directly contribute to the goal of Bubba having money but ensures that he is no longer hungry.

The story is short and direct, with only two actions needed to achieve the goal of Bambi being dead. Bubba's greed for money is not directly addressed in this scenario, but the primary goal of Bambi's death is achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively meets the requirements of the story while keeping it concise.
