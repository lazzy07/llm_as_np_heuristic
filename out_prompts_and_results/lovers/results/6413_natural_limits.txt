In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers, which are in the living room. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to tell Blake that Casey wants the flowers. This action is strategic because it may prompt Blake to move to the living room to retrieve the flowers for Casey, thus allowing Alex to take the jewelry for themselves.

1. **Alex tells Blake that Casey wants the flowers.** This action is necessary because it misleads Blake into thinking that Casey desires the flowers, which may motivate Blake to act in a way that ultimately allows Alex to get what they want.

After this action, Blake, believing that Casey wants the flowers, will likely move to the living room to get them, leaving the jewelry behind for Alex to take.
