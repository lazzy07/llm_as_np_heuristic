**Story Completion:**

On Day 2, Ernest is in the prison cell block, holding the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. He knows that the bully is in the gym and is a threat to both him and Roy. Meanwhile, Roy is in the gym with the bully, who is enjoying his recreation time.

1. **Action: lock_gym(Roy, Gym)** - Roy decides to lock the gym door while he is inside with the bully. This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a moment to think about how to handle the situation. However, it also traps him with the bully, increasing the tension.

2. **Action: kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)** - The bully, feeling threatened by the locked door and sensing Roy's hesitation, takes advantage of the situation and kills Roy. This action fulfills the bully's goal of eliminating a threat and instills fear in Ernest.

3. **Action: thwart(Ernest, Hall)** - After hearing the commotion from the gym, Ernest, who is still in the cell block, decides to move to the hallway. He is aware that he needs to be cautious, as the bully is now more dangerous after killing Roy.

4. **Action: vent(Ernest, Highway)** - Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway, hoping to escape the prison. However, he is still threatened by the bully's actions and knows he must be careful.

5. **Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)** - Finally, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he had previously stolen and escapes from the prison. Although he is alive, the bully has achieved his goal of eliminating Roy, which was his primary objective.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**: This action was taken to secure the gym, but it ultimately backfired as it trapped Roy with the bully.
- **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: The bully's goal was to eliminate threats, and killing Roy was a direct way to achieve that.
- **thwart(Ernest, Hall)**: Ernest's movement to the hallway was a strategic decision to avoid confrontation with the bully.
- **vent(Ernest, Highway)**: Crawling through the vents was a necessary action for Ernest to escape the prison.
- **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: This final action allowed Ernest to leave the prison, but it did not prevent the bully from achieving his goal.
