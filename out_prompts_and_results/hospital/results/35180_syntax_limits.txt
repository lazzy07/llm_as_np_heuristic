**Story Completion:**

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B. This action is necessary because Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This also increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

2. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A to determine their symptoms. This is crucial for Hathaway to understand what disease Young may have and to provide the correct treatment.

3. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with antibiotics, assuming Young has Flaze (fever). This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy, as the treatment matches the disease.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to admit Jones, which is essential for Hathaway to manage all patients effectively and ensure they receive the necessary care.
- The second action is to assess Young, which is critical for diagnosing the disease correctly. Since Hathaway's workload is at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the assessment is still necessary to proceed with treatment.
- The third action is to treat Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This ensures that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
