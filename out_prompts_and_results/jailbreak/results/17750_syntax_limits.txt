Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his pack of cigarettes. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and the gym door is locked, which gives him a moment of respite. 

To protect himself and secure his goal of having a pack of cigarettes, Ernest takes the following action:

1. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Kitchen)**: Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will help him avoid detection by the guards and the bully.
