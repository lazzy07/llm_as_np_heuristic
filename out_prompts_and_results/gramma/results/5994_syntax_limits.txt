Tom is at the Crossroads, carrying the medicine he stole from the merchant. He knows that the guard is at the market and that the bandit is also at the crossroads. To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, knowing that this will distract the guard and allow him to escape.

Tom takes the action to report the bandit’s location to the guard. This action is necessary because it creates a diversion, allowing Tom to leave the crossroads without being pursued by the guard, who will now focus on the bandit.

After reporting, Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, successfully reaching his destination with the medicine.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **report(Tom, Crossroads, Market)** - Tom reports the bandit’s location to the guard, creating a distraction.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)** - Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.

The story is complete, and Tom has successfully reached the cottage with the medicine.
