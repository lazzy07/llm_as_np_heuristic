To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave with Rory and Gargax, while Vince is dead. The treasure is also at the cave, which can help Talia achieve her goal of wealth. 

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's body.**  
   - This action is necessary because Rory needs to acquire the money that Vince had, which can contribute to Talia's happiness and wealth.

2. **Rory proposes to Talia.**  
   - Rory wants to be happy and wealthy, and since Talia is already married to Vince (who is dead), Rory can propose to Talia to create a new bond that can lead to her happiness.

3. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Talia to become happy through the acceptance of Rory's proposal.

4. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This final action solidifies Talia's happiness, as she is now married to Rory, who is alive and can provide her with a sense of security and companionship.

5. **Rory takes the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, which can be shared with Talia, thus contributing to her wealth.

Now, Talia is happy because she is married to Rory, and she can also become wealthy through the treasure that Rory has taken.
