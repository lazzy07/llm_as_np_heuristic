To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following sequence of actions will be taken:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army needs to travel to Tanis to confront the Nazis and retrieve the Ark. This action is necessary to bring the US Army into the same location as the Nazis.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, USA)**: Once the US Army arrives in Tanis, they will take the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is crucial as it allows the US Army to gain possession of the Ark.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: After taking the Ark, the US Army will open it. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army members who opened it. However, the goal is to ensure the Nazis are dead, and this action will also eliminate the threat posed by the Ark.

4. **status(Nazis) = Dead**: The Nazis will be dead as a result of the US Army's actions, fulfilling the requirement that they are no longer a threat.

The sequence of actions ensures that the US Army successfully obtains the Ark while eliminating the Nazis, who mistakenly believed the Ark was safe. The US Army's actions lead to their demise, allowing the Ark to be in the hands of the US Army.
