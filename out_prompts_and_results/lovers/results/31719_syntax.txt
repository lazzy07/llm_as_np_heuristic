To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R12)**: Since Casey (C2) has the chocolates (I3) and wants the item that Alex (C1) has (which is I2, the jewelry), they can trade. This action allows Alex to obtain the chocolates they desire.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I2) and will be happy if they wanted it.
- Blake (C3) will still be in the dining room with the flowers (I1) and will remain unhappy unless they also get what they want.

However, since the goal is to ensure Alex is happy, this single trade action is sufficient.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R12)**: This action is necessary because it allows Alex to acquire the chocolates they want, thus fulfilling their desire for happiness. It also aligns with Casey's desire to make Alex happy, as they are willing to trade their item for what they want.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R12)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates they desire.
