Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, and they both share a mutual desire for safety and friendship. To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and plan her next steps.

**Action: teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**

This action is chosen because it allows Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensure her safety while maintaining her relationship with the Lizard. By teleporting to the ship, she can also strategize on how to further build a friendship with the Lizard in the future.
