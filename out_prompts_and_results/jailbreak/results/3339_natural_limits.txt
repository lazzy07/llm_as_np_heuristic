**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he knows the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, he finds the bully distracted and seizes the opportunity to grab the knife that Roy had left behind during his punishment duties. With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation, kills him to ensure both his and Roy's safety.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now return to the hallway, put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, and escape from the prison through the highway.

1. **Crawl through the vents to the gym**: This action allows Ernest to confront the bully directly, which is necessary for him to eliminate the threat.
2. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This action is crucial for ensuring that both Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to survive and achieve their goal of staying alive.
