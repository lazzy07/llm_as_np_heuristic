To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway believes Jones is alive and is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway should assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment Jones needs.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should also assess Ross, who is also in the admissions room. This will help Hathaway identify Ross's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Jones**: Once Hathaway has assessed Jones and identified their symptoms, Hathaway can treat Jones with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. This is crucial for ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway should treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway should treat Young in Exam Room A, as Young has already been assessed and has a known symptom. This will ensure that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring they are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Jones**: Necessary to identify Jones's symptoms for treatment.
- **Assess Ross**: Necessary to identify Ross's symptoms for treatment.
- **Treat Jones**: Required to make Jones healthy based on the identified symptoms.
- **Treat Ross**: Required to make Ross healthy based on the identified symptoms.
- **Treat Young**: Required to make Young healthy, as their symptoms are already known.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomJ, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomR, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, TreatmentJ, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, TreatmentR, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, TreatmentY, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
```

In this JSON object, `SymptomJ`, `SymptomR`, `TreatmentJ`, `TreatmentR`, and `TreatmentY` would be replaced with the actual symptoms and treatments based on the diseases Flaze and Jarkis, ensuring that Hathaway treats each patient correctly.
