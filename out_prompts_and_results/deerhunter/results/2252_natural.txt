To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also present in the forest, and Bubba has a loaded rifle, which gives him the ability to shoot.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. It also eliminates Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
   
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action directly fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead. 

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat her, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can now take any money she might have had, which fulfills his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
