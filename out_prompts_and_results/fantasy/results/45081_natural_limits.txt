In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, as it will make him wealthy, and he also needs to ensure he is not hungry.

Here's the completed story:

1. Rory travels from the cave to the village. (Rory needs to leave the cave to reach Talia and Vince, who are at the village.)
2. Rory proposes to Talia. (Rory wants to marry Talia to achieve happiness.)
3. Talia accepts Rory's proposal. (This makes both Rory and Talia happy.)
4. Rory and Talia get married. (This solidifies their happiness.)
5. Rory travels back to the cave with Talia. (Rory needs to go back to the cave to get the treasure.)
6. Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. (This action makes Rory wealthy.)
7. Rory and Talia return to the village. (They can now enjoy their happiness and wealth together.)
