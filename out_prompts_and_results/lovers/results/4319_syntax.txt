To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, we need to ensure that Casey receives the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Alex is already happy with the flowers (I1), the focus will be on helping Casey.

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the room where Casey is located (R21). This is necessary for Blake to interact with Casey and help them achieve happiness.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This is important because Casey wants the jewelry (I3), and by giving the chocolates, Blake can create a situation where Casey can trade for the jewelry.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R22). This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially trade for the jewelry.

4. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they received from Blake for the jewelry (I3) from Alex. This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.

After these actions, the happiness status will be:
- Alex is happy with the flowers (I1).
- Blake is happy with the chocolates (I2).
- Casey is happy with the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions ensures that all characters achieve their goals of happiness.
