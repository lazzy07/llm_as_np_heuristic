To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned a symptom, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will need to assess Ross, who is also in the admissions room. This will help determine Ross's condition and the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is in exam room C. This will complete the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the treatment.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to identify his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure he receives the right treatment.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to find out his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.
