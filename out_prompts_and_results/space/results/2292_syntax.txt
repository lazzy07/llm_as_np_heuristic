To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which will also help ensure both characters feel safe.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the cave. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving her goal but can be seen as a way to ensure she is in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is now in the cave, she is safe. This action is included to show the danger of the surface and reinforce Zoe's decision to move to the cave after making peace.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
