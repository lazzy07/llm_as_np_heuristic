To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her current situation. Talia is already married to Vince, which gives her a level of happiness (1). However, she is not wealthy enough to be satisfied with her current wealth (1). 

The quickest way to increase Talia's wealth is for her to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia is already in the cave, she can pick up the treasure. This action will increase her wealth, and since she is already married to Vince, her happiness will remain intact.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.
