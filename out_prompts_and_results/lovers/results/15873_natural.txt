To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (Blake wants the chocolates and needs to move to the dining room to get them.)
2. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.** (Blake needs to return to the living room with the chocolates.)
3. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex in the living room.** (This action allows Alex to receive the chocolates, which they want.)
4. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.** (Alex can now take the flowers since they are in the same room.)
5. **Alex gives the flowers to Blake in the living room.** (This action allows Alex to fulfill their desire for the flowers, making them happy.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room:** This is necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness, as they want the chocolates.
- **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room:** This is required for Blake to be in the same room as Alex to give them the chocolates.
- **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex in the living room:** This action directly helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness by providing them with the flowers.
- **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room:** This is the key action for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
- **Alex gives the flowers to Blake in the living room:** This action ensures that Alex is happy, as they now have the flowers they wanted.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
