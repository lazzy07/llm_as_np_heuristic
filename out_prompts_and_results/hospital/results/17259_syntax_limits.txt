### Story Completion

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes that Jones is alive and healthy. This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms observed. If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If he shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Ross. Similar to Jones, Hathaway needs to determine Ross's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms observed. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy as well.
