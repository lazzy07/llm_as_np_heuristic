To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit will walk from the camp to the crossroads. 
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the market where the merchant and the hero are located, allowing for potential interaction.

2. The bandit will rob the hero, taking the merchant's sword.
   - The bandit is armed and the hero is not armed, making this action possible. By taking the sword, the bandit increases her power and can potentially use it to further her goals.

3. The bandit will walk to the market.
   - This action allows the bandit to confront the merchant and the guard, who are both at the market.

4. The bandit will rob the merchant, taking the hero's coin.
   - The bandit can rob the merchant because the merchant is unarmed. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of acquiring coins.

5. The bandit will walk back to the camp.
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her base with the stolen coin, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

6. The bandit will place the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is chosen to ensure the bandit can acquire coins while avoiding confrontation with the guard, who is a threat to her safety. The bandit strategically robs the hero and the merchant, both of whom are vulnerable, and then returns to her camp to secure her gains.
