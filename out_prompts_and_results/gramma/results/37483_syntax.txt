To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the Market where he can interact with the Merchant and potentially acquire a coin.

2. **Tom buys a coin from the Merchant using the Medicine.**  
   - Tom needs a coin to facilitate his next actions. He can trade the medicine he has for a coin, which is a valuable exchange since he needs to be armed to defend himself.

3. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.**  
   - After acquiring the coin, Tom needs to return to the Crossroads to prepare for his next move towards the cottage.

4. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there while carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his objective without unnecessary conflict or complications.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
