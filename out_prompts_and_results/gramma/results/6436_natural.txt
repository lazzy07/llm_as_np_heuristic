To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, where he can carry the medicine.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to signify that Tom has successfully achieved his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

The story is very straightforward, as Tom only needs to walk to the cottage to fulfill his goal. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, and since Tom is not armed, he cannot engage in any conflict.
