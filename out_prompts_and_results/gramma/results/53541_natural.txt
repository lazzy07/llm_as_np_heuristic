1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the hero and the merchant, allowing her to potentially rob them or take advantage of the situation.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp with the stolen items, ensuring her safety and securing her gains.

### Explanation of Actions
- The bandit first moves to the crossroads to confront the merchant. By attacking and killing the merchant, she eliminates a non-threatening character and gains access to the medicine. Looting the merchant's corpse allows her to take the medicine, which is an item she can carry. Finally, returning to the bandit camp secures her position and the items she has acquired.
