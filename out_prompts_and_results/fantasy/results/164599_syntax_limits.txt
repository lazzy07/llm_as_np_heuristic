In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. After eating both Talia and Vince, Gargax travels back to the cave where the treasure is located. Since Gargax is already at the cave, he can simply pick up the treasure, fulfilling his goal of becoming wealthy and not hungry.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)** - Gargax travels back to the cave after eating Talia and Vince, ensuring he is in the right location to collect the treasure.
2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)** - Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave, achieving his goal of wealth.

The actions are necessary because Gargax needs to be in the cave to access the treasure, and picking it up is the final step to fulfill his desire for wealth.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)"
  ]
}
