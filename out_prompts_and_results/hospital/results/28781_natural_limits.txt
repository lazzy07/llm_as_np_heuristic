Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway confirms that Ross is experiencing a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young, who is still waiting there. Dr. Hathaway assigns Young to Patient Room C. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease. However, since Young is still alive, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with antibiotics, which is a safe option, as it will not harm him. 

This series of actions ensures that both Ross and Young are treated appropriately, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
