**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully believes he is in the laundry room, so he uses this to his advantage.

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.**  
   - This action allows Ernest to sneak into the gym without being detected by the bully, who thinks he is still in the laundry room.

2. **Ernest locks the gym door behind him.**  
   - By locking the door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape once he confronts him.

3. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.**  
   - This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Ernest and Roy are safe.

4. **Ernest takes the civilian clothes from the laundry room.**  
   - After dealing with the bully, Ernest needs to disguise himself to escape. He returns to the laundry room to grab the clothes.

5. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.**  
   - Wearing the civilian clothes will allow Ernest to blend in and avoid detection as he makes his escape.

6. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.**  
   - This final action leads Ernest to the highway, where he can escape from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is strategically chosen to ensure Ernest's survival and to eliminate the threat from the bully. The use of stealth (crawling through vents) and locking doors prevents confrontation until Ernest is ready. Killing the bully is essential to remove the immediate danger. Finally, obtaining and wearing civilian clothes is crucial for a successful escape.
