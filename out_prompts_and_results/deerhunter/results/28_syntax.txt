Bubba's greed is high, and he wants to get money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to shoot the clerk and take the money. The clerk has no means to defend himself since Bubba has a loaded rifle.

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take control of the bank, which is necessary for him to access the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to physically take the money, achieving his goal of obtaining wealth.
