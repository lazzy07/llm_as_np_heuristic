To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave where the treasure is located. Here’s the completed story:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and potentially secure her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. This action is crucial because it fulfills her relationship goal, which contributes to her happiness.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to create a scenario where Rory may need to rely on Talia, enhancing their bond.

5. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money that was with Vince's body. This action is included to ensure Talia has both wealth (from the treasure) and money, solidifying her financial status.

6. **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory accepts Talia's proposal again, reinforcing their relationship and ensuring both characters are happy.

By following these actions, Talia achieves her goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring both treasure and money).
