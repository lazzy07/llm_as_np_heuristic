Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and friendship.

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - Zoe decides to lead the Lizard to a safer location, the cave, where they can discuss their friendship and safety away from the dangers of the surface.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, recognizing the need for safety and wanting to stay close to Zoe, who has become a friend.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship, ensuring that they are both committed to being allies and supporting each other.

4. **The volcano erupts on the surface.** - As they are safe in the cave, the volcano erupts, confirming that they made the right choice to move away from the surface.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship. The cave provides a safe haven from the erupting volcano, and their mutual commitment to friendship ensures they will look out for each other in the future.
