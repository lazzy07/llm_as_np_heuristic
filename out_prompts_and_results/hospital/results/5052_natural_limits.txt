Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B to reduce the number of patients in Admissions. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for better management of the patients.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A to assess Ross. Since Ross is already assigned to Patient Room A, Dr. Hathaway can assess him without any issues. During the assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross is experiencing a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Ross healthy, allowing him to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced back to 1 after treating Ross.
