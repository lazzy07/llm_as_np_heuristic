Zoe, the space explorer, is in the cave, contemplating her next move. She knows that the Lizard is on the surface, and she wants to make friends with it. The Lizard, meanwhile, is feeling unsafe and is looking for companionship. 

To achieve their goals, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because it allows her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' desires to make friends and ensures that they are not fighting, which would hinder their relationship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard feels safe and decides to walk with Zoe back to the cave. This action symbolizes their newfound friendship and allows them to explore the cave together, further solidifying their bond.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
