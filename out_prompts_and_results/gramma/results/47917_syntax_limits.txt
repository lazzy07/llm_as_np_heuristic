To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to acquire the medicine from the merchant and then walk back to the cottage. Since the merchant is currently at the market with the medicine, Tom can buy the medicine from her using one of the coins he has. After acquiring the medicine, he can then walk back to the cottage.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using one of the coins he has. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom walks back to the cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location.

With these two actions, Tom successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
