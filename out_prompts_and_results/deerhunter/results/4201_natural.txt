To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, since he is hungry, he may want to eat something. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. Since Bambi is alive, Bubba cannot eat her yet.
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi, which allows him to kill her and then eat her. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his hunger.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, satisfying his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and has also satisfied his hunger by eating. The clerk remains at the bank, and Bambi is no longer alive.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to find food.
- **Shoot Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to kill Bambi, making her available for eating.
- **Eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a secondary goal but important for his well-being.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json

  "plan": [
    "decide to eat Bambi",
    "shoot Bambi",
    "eat Bambi"
  ]

``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger.
