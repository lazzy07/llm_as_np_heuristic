To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her marrying Vince, who has the money, and then acquiring the treasure. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax, wanting to be wealthy and not hungry, sees Rory as a potential meal. This action removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince without competition for wealth or happiness.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure**: With Rory gone, Vince can now focus on Talia and the treasure. He picks up the treasure located in the cave, which will contribute to Talia's wealth.

3. **Talia picks up the money from Vince**: Talia, now married to Vince, can take the money he has. This action ensures that Talia becomes wealthy.

4. **Talia's happiness increases**: Since Talia is married to Vince and has acquired the money, her happiness increases as she achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy.

The actions taken are necessary to ensure Talia's goals are met while also considering the motivations of the other characters. Gargax's action of eating Rory eliminates competition, while Vince's actions help Talia achieve her wealth.
