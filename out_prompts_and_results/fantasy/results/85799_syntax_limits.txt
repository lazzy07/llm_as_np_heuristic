In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure in the cave and ensure he is happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the cave where Talia and Gargax are located. This is necessary for Rory to be in the same location as Talia, who has proposed to him, and to potentially access the treasure.

2. **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory accepts Talia's marriage proposal. This action makes both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's happiness requirement.

Now, Rory is happy and has the potential to become wealthy by accessing the treasure in the cave. However, since the story only requires Rory to achieve his goal of happiness and wealth, we do not need to include the action of picking up the treasure.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Rory to be in the same location as Talia, allowing him to accept her proposal and work towards his happiness.
- **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Accepting Talia's proposal directly contributes to Rory's happiness, which is one of his primary goals.
