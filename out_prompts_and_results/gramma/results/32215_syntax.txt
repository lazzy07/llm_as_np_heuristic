To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can safely leave the market and reach the cottage without being attacked or hindered by the other characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to head towards the cottage. This action is necessary to move him closer to his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom continues on to the cottage. This action is essential as it takes him directly to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- The first action is necessary because Tom must exit the market where he currently is. He cannot go to the cottage directly from the market, so he must first go to the crossroads.
  
- The second action is crucial as it takes Tom from the crossroads to the cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine.

Since there are no other characters taking actions that would interfere with Tom's journey (the bandit is already dead, and the merchant and guard are not in a position to stop him), these two actions are sufficient for Tom to achieve his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
