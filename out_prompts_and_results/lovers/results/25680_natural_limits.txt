In the living room, Blake looks at the flowers in their hands and realizes that they are not what they want. They want the chocolates that are in the dining room. Blake decides to tell Casey that Alex wants the flowers, hoping to create a distraction. 

Blake says to Casey, "Alex really wants the flowers." This statement is a lie, as Alex actually wants the flowers, but Blake is trying to manipulate the situation to get what they want.
