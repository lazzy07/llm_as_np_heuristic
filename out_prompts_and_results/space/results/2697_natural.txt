Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to take action to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there is a way to help the Lizard protect the planet.
   
2. **The volcano erupts.** - This is a natural event that occurs as a consequence of the previous actions and adds urgency to the situation.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption, which is a critical part of the story's conclusion.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard, realizing Zoe is in danger, rushes to the surface to try to save her, but it is too late.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe's memory.** - Although Zoe has died, the Lizard reflects on their friendship and the importance of their bond, ensuring that they remain friends in spirit.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of Zoe, and the Lizard making peace with Zoe's memory, fulfilling the story's requirements.
