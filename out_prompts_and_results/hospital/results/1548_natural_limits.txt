   - Explanation: Young needs to be in the exam room to be assessed and treated. This action places him in the correct location.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine his symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, this assessment is crucial for the next step.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - Explanation: Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot be sure of the disease. However, treating with steroids is a safe option as it is the treatment for Jarkis, which is a possibility. This action will either make Young healthy or lead to a mistake if he has Flaze.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway knows Ross has a fever, which indicates Flaze. Treating him with antibiotics will ensure he becomes healthy.
