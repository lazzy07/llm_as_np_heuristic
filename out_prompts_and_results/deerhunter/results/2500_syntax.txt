To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba obtaining the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he has just eaten Bambi and heads to the bank to confront the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba uses the rifle he has loaded with ammunition to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle between him and the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

With these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will remain dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
