To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface from the cave. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard back to the surface where the volcano is located, setting the stage for the eruption.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is crucial as it initiates the dangerous event that will lead to a character's demise.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action will result in the death of the Lizard, as it is on the surface when the eruption occurs.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to be present on the surface during the eruption, allowing her to witness the event.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace before the eruption. This action is important as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

The final sequence of actions leads to the Lizard's death due to the eruption while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard have made peace before this tragic event.
