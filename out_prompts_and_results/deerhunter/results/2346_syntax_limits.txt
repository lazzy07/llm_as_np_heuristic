To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle he has loaded. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just shot Bambi, to the bank, where he can access the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint, ensuring that he achieves his goal of acquiring money.
