Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to investigate the situation and possibly make contact with the Lizard. However, this action angers the Lizard, who sees Zoe as a threat to the planet. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (Zoe wants to understand the situation on the surface and potentially make friends with the Lizard.)
2. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** (The Lizard senses Zoe's presence and wants to confront her to protect the planet.)
3. **Zoe and the Lizard are now in the same location.** (This allows them to interact directly.)
4. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (Zoe wants to be safe and healthy, and making peace aligns with her goal of friendship.)
5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** (The Lizard also desires friendship and safety, and by making peace, they can work together.)
6. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** (This solidifies their relationship and ensures both characters feel safe and healthy.)
7. **The surface erupts.** (This is a natural event that occurs regardless of their actions, but since they are now friends, they can work together to find safety.)
8. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the ship.** (They both want to be safe from the eruption, and teleporting to the ship ensures their safety.)

By the end of these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.
