Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, as the cave is a more secure environment. 

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they remain together as friends and can continue to build their relationship in a safe space.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they remain allies, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

4. **The volcano erupts on the surface.** - This event occurs after they have moved to the cave, ensuring that they are safe from the eruption. 

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
