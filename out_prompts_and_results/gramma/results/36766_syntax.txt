To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market to confront Tom and take his coin. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to be in the same location as Tom to rob him.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of his coin. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is part of her goal.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads after robbing Tom. This is necessary for her to move to the Bandit Camp with the coins she has just acquired.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from Tom and places them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.
