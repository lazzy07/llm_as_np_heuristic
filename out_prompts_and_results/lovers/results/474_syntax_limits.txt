In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has, while Casey wants the flowers (I3) that Alex believes are with Blake (C2). To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, they need to get the jewelry from Casey. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve that:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the chocolates (I2) they believe Blake has for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (jewelry) while also ensuring that Casey gets something in return, which may help her be happy as well.

The action sequence is as follows:

- **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates they believe Blake has for the jewelry that Casey has. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the jewelry they wanted.

After this action, the situation is:

- Alex is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey is happy because they received chocolates (I2) in the trade.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of being happy.

### Explanation of the action:
- **trade**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire while also providing Casey with an item she may want, thus potentially making both characters happy.
