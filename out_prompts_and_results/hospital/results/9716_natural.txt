**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A, where Young is also located. Since Dr. Hathaway is overwhelmed, there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosing the patients. Young, wanting to be healthy, decides to take action.

1. **Young walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Young to be assessed by Dr. Hathaway, as Young is currently in the same room as Dr. Hathaway and needs to be in a room where the doctor can assess them without the risk of confusion with other patients.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in Patient Room C, there is no risk of confusion, and Dr. Hathaway can accurately assess Young's condition.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment will ensure Young becomes healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now reduced to 2 after assessing Young, the risk of making a mistake is lower.

After these actions, Young is treated correctly and becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Young's movement to Patient Room C allows for a clear assessment without the risk of confusion from other patients.
- The assessment is crucial for determining the correct treatment.
- The treatment is the final step to ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.
