To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R21)**: After the trade, Casey will give the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1). This action is included to ensure that Alex can also be happy, as they want the flowers (I1) that are still in the room.

3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex will pick up the flowers (I1) from the room. This action is necessary for Alex to achieve their happiness.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: Alex will give the flowers (I1) to Blake (C2). This action ensures that Blake can also be happy, as they want the flowers.

After these actions, all characters will be happy because they will have the items they want.
