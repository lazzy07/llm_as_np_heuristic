To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot the bank clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and shooting the clerk will allow him to take it without resistance.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest after taking the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the scene.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can eat Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
