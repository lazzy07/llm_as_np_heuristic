**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is a threat, and he has the pack of cigarettes, which he can use to distract the bully.

1. **Go to the Hall**: Roy moves from the kitchen to the hallway to get closer to Ernest and assess the situation.
   
2. **Vent to the Gym**: Once in the hallway, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym where the bully is currently located. This allows him to avoid direct confrontation.

3. **Steal the Knife**: While in the gym, Roy quickly grabs the knife that is lying around, which he can use for protection or to eliminate the bully.

4. **Lock the Gym Door**: Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping and to ensure he can confront him without interference.

5. **Kill the Bully**: With the knife in hand and the gym door locked, Roy confronts the bully and kills him, removing the threat to both himself and Ernest.

6. **Disguise with Civilian Clothes**: After dealing with the bully, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier to disguise himself.

7. **Go to the Hall**: Roy then moves back to the hallway, ready to escape.

8. **Escape to the Highway**: Finally, Roy exits the prison through the highway, successfully escaping and achieving his goal of staying alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure Roy can eliminate the threat posed by the bully while also preparing for a successful escape.
- The use of the knife is crucial for self-defense and to ensure the bully cannot threaten them anymore.
- Locking the gym door is a strategic move to isolate the bully and prevent any chance of retaliation.
- Disguising with civilian clothes is necessary for a successful escape, as it allows Roy to blend in outside the prison.
