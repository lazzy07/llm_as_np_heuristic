Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high to effectively assess the patients, decides to prioritize the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B.** This action is necessary to reduce the number of patients in the admissions room and allows Hathaway to start addressing Jones's unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room C.** This further reduces the workload in admissions and allows Hathaway to focus on Ross's unknown symptoms.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A.** Since Young is already assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can now assess Young's symptoms directly. This is crucial to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which successfully makes Young healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway effectively reduces their workload and treats Young, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
