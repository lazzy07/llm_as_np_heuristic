To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to be in her preferred location, where she can interact with customers and potentially sell items for coins.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard is moving to the crossroads to investigate the situation, as he is aware that a criminal (the bandit) is nearby.

3. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit moves to the market to potentially rob the merchant or interact with the guard, as she is looking to acquire more coins.

4. **The bandit robs the merchant and takes the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to acquire a coin from the merchant, which is beneficial for the bandit but also allows the merchant to still have a chance to sell items.

5. **The guard arrives at the crossroads and reports the bandit’s location.**  
   - The guard is now aware of the bandit’s presence and can take action against her, which indirectly helps the merchant by potentially removing the bandit from the scene.

6. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit threat, allowing the merchant to continue her business without fear of robbery.

7. **The merchant loots the bandit's corpse and takes the coin.**  
   - After the bandit is dead, the merchant can take the coin that was stolen from her, thus achieving her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

In this sequence, the merchant successfully navigates the situation to regain her lost coin while avoiding criminal activity. The actions taken by the guard ensure the safety of the merchant and the market, allowing her to continue her business.
