To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army travels to Tanis to confront the Nazis and retrieve the Ark. This action is necessary because the US Army needs to be at the same location as the Ark to take control of it.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, Tanis)**: The US Army takes the Ark from Indiana Jones by force. This action is essential because the US Army wants the Ark, and since Indiana Jones is currently in possession of it, they need to take it to fulfill their goal.
