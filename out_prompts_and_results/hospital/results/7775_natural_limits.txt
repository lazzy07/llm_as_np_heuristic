Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is in Patient Room B.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will assume he has Flaze, as it is the only disease that can be treated with antibiotics.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with antibiotics.** (This action is crucial as it aims to make Jones healthy. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze, the treatment will be effective.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to admit Ross, who is still in Admissions.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** (This action is essential to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room for future assessment and treatment.)

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones, making him healthy, and has also admitted Ross to an exam room for further care.
