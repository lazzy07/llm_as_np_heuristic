To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Bubba goes to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Each Action:
