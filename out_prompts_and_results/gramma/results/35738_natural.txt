The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin and attacked the merchant, now has the opportunity to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. The bandit decides to take the following actions:

1. **Loot the Merchant's Corpse**: The bandit loots the merchant's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the merchant might have had. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count and acquire the medicine, which could be valuable.
