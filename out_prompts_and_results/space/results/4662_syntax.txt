Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are currently safe and healthy, but the surface is dangerous. To ensure their safety and to foster friendship, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their bond in a safe environment. It emphasizes their mutual desire for friendship and safety.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action is taken to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she can monitor the situation from the ship.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Surface)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship to join Zoe. This action is taken to ensure that both characters are safe and can continue their friendship in a secure environment.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Ship)**: Once again, they reinforce their friendship aboard the spaceship, ensuring that both characters feel safe and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard.
