To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to give to Casey in exchange for the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary to interact with Casey and facilitate the trade.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to offer something to Casey in exchange for the jewelry.

5. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) with Alex for the chocolates (I2). This is the final action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy.
