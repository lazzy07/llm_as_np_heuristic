Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He knows he needs to get back to the cottage. The guard is also at the crossroads, and he is armed. The bandit is at the market, and the merchant is there as well. 

To achieve his goal of getting to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it will distract the guard, allowing Tom to safely walk back to the cottage without any threat from the bandit.
