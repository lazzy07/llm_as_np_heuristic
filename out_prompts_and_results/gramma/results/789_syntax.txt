To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom, taking the coin that Tom has. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the crossroads. This action is necessary to move away from the market and towards the bandit camp, where she can secure her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the crossroads, the bandit will take the coins from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the coins are safely stored and count towards her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The bandit robs Tom to acquire his coin, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.
- The bandit then moves to the crossroads to transition towards her camp, where she can secure her loot.
- Finally, she places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring they are safely stored and counted towards her goal.
