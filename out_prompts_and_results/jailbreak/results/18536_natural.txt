1. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** This action is crucial because it removes the immediate threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to feel safe and secure.

2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that no one can enter and interrupt him or discover what has happened, giving him time to think about his next move.

3. **Ernest sneaks through the vent to the hallway.** This action allows Ernest to escape the gym without being seen, maintaining his safety after the confrontation.
