To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he knows that the bank clerk has money. The most efficient way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to go to the bank, steal the money from the clerk, and then leave.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba threatens the clerk and steals the money.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential because Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money. Without this action, he cannot achieve his goal.
  
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully intimidate the clerk into giving up the money, which is the ultimate goal of Bubba.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires.
