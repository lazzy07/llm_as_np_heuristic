To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.** 
   - Action: `give(C2, I3, C3, R21)`
   - Explanation: Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. Since Alex has the jewelry (I3) and Casey wants it, this action allows Casey to receive the item they desire.

2. **Casey is now happy.**
   - Explanation: After receiving the jewelry, Casey's goal is achieved, and they are now happy.

The other characters (Alex and Blake) are not directly involved in this action since the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C2, I3, C3, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Casey gets the jewelry they want, thus achieving their happiness.
