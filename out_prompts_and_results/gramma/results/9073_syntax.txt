To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation without being harmed by the armed characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. This action is necessary as it directly moves him to where he wants to be.

Now, let's explain why this action is included:

- **Tom's Goal**: Tom wants to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. By walking directly to the cottage, he achieves his goal without any conflict or need for confrontation with the other characters.

Since Tom is already carrying the medicine and there are no other actions required to achieve his goal, this single action is sufficient.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows Tom to reach his goal in the simplest manner possible.
