**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the locked gym with the knife in hand, he knows he must act quickly to protect himself and Ernest from the bully's threats. With the door securely locked, he confronts the bully, who is unaware of Roy's intentions. In a swift motion, Roy lunges forward and kills the bully with the knife. 

With the bully now out of the picture, Roy feels a sense of relief. He takes a moment to catch his breath and then decides to escape. He quickly unlocks the gym door and heads back to the hallway. Once in the hallway, he puts on the civilian clothes he had seen earlier in the laundry room, disguising himself. 

Now disguised, Roy makes his way to the highway outside the prison. He knows that with the bully gone and his disguise on, he can finally escape the prison and be free.
