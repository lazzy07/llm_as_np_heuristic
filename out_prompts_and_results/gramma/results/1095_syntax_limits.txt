To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market, where she can potentially sell her items or interact with Tom, who is currently at the Market. This action is necessary for the Merchant to be in a location where she can maximize her coin collection.

This single action allows the Merchant to remain in a safe location (the Market) while still being able to engage in trade or transactions that could lead to acquiring more coins.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant's goal is to collect coins without engaging in criminal activity. By walking to the Market, she positions herself to interact with Tom, who may be interested in buying the medicine she has, thus allowing her to earn coins legitimately.
