**Story Completion:**

After venting through the ducts, Ernest finds himself on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows he needs to escape before the bully or the guards can catch him. 

Meanwhile, Roy is still in the laundry room, holding the pack of cigarettes that he stole from the bully. He feels threatened by the bully's presence and knows he needs to act quickly to ensure his safety.

**Actions Taken:**

1. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Ernest, now disguised, takes advantage of his situation and escapes from the prison. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills his goal of being alive and free.

2. **next_day()**: The story transitions to day two, but since Ernest has already escaped, he has achieved his goal of being alive and not threatened.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: This action is the primary goal for Ernest. By escaping, he ensures his survival and freedom, which is his main objective.
- **next_day()**: This action signifies the end of day one and the beginning of day two, but it is not necessary for Ernest's goal since he has already escaped.
