To complete the story, Tom needs to get to the cottage while carrying the medicine. Since the medicine is currently with the merchant, and the merchant is dead after Tom's attack, Tom can loot the medicine from the merchant's corpse. After that, Tom can walk back to the cottage.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: Tom loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying it.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action is necessary to reach his desired location.

After these actions, Tom will be at the cottage carrying the medicine, thus achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting the Medicine**: This is the only way for Tom to obtain the medicine since the merchant is dead and cannot sell it to him.
- **Walking to the Cottage**: This is the final step for Tom to reach his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
