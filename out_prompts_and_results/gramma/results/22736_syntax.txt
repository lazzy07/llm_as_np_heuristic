To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves from the Bandit Camp to the Crossroads, where she can potentially encounter the Merchant and Tom.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom moves to the Market, where he can interact with the Merchant and potentially buy more items.

4. **rob(Merchant, BanditSword, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, robs the Bandit, taking her sword. This action is necessary for the Merchant to gain an advantage and ensure her safety while maximizing her coin collection.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can access the Bandit’s coins.

6. **take(Merchant, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant takes the coins from the Bandit’s chest, achieving her goal of acquiring more coins without becoming a criminal.
