To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead (which is already the case). Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure the money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk as a threat and to take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having the money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located. Without this action, he cannot interact with the clerk or take the money.

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only obstacle preventing him from taking the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk without any repercussions.

- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action is the final step for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money. After the clerk is eliminated, Bubba can safely take the money from the bank.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
