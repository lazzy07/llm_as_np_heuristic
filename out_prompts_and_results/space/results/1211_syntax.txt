To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on the surface and have made peace, the next step is to ensure they both remain safe from the dangerous environment. 

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe knows that the surface is dangerous, and to ensure both she and the Lizard are safe, she decides to start the eruption of the volcano. This action is necessary to create a sense of urgency for both characters to leave the surface.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After starting the eruption, Zoe quickly walks back to her spaceship. This action is crucial for her safety, as she needs to get off the surface before the eruption becomes dangerous.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, seeing the volcano beginning to erupt, decides to retreat to the cave for safety. This action ensures that the Lizard is also safe from the eruption.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring she is safe from the eruption. Although this action makes the Lizard angry, it is necessary for her safety.

5. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: After both characters have reached their safe locations, Zoe can reach out to the Lizard from her ship and make peace again, solidifying their friendship despite the earlier tension.

This sequence of actions ensures that both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship.
