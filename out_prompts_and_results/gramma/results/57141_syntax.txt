To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Crossroads with a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This is essential for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without needing to commit a more serious crime, which could attract the Guard's attention.
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This movement is necessary to secure the coins in a safe location, away from the market where the Guard is present.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.
