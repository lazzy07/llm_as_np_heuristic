Zoe, aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface of the planet is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the imminent eruption of the volcano. She decides to teleport back to the surface to warn the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship and ensure both their safety.

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to find the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to communicate with the Lizard about the volcano and work towards making peace.

2. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and explains the danger of the volcano erupting. They both agree to work together to ensure their safety and become friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and being safe.

3. **Erupt (Surface)**: As they are talking, the volcano erupts unexpectedly. Unfortunately, Zoe is caught in the eruption and dies. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also highlighting the urgency of their situation.

In summary, the story illustrates Zoe's attempt to connect with the Lizard and warn him about the volcano, leading to their friendship just before the tragic eruption.
