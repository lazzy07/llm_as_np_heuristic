To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross** in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms.
2. **Assess Young** in Admissions to determine his symptoms.
3. **Assess Jones** in Admissions to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat Ross** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
5. **Treat Young** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

### Explanation of Actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake.

2. **Assess Young**: Similarly, assessing Young will help Hathaway determine his condition and the appropriate treatment. 

3. **Assess Jones**: Finally, assessing Jones is crucial to understand his symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the identified symptoms. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

5. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the identified symptoms, ensuring he receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones based on his symptoms, ensuring that all patients receive the appropriate care.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
