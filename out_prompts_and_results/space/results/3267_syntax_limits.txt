Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. The Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is also present, and both characters are in a precarious situation. To achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is chosen because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to stop any potential conflict and work towards a friendship. By making peace, they can both focus on their shared goal of safety and health, especially with the volcano erupting.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can collaborate to find a safe place away from the danger of the volcano, thus achieving their goals of being healthy and safe.
