**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Ernest, feeling the pressure of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to do his chores to avoid further punishment, so he heads to the laundry room to complete them. While there, he finds the knife hidden behind some laundry. 

Meanwhile, in the gym, Roy is locked in with the bully. He knows he needs to escape this situation, so he waits for the right moment. When the bully is distracted, Roy uses his strength to break down the door, surprising the bully. 

Ernest, now armed with the knife, returns to the gym just as Roy breaks free. Together, they confront the bully. With the knife in hand, Ernest takes the opportunity to defend himself and Roy, killing the bully in a swift motion. 

With the bully out of the way, they both feel a sense of relief. They search the gym and find the civilian clothes that Roy had stolen earlier. They quickly put them on, disguising themselves.
