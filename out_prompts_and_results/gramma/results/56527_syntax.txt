To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit starts at the Cottage and walks to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit then walks to the Market, where the Merchant is located. This is important because the Bandit can potentially rob the Merchant, who is carrying a coin.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coin that the Merchant is carrying. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to prepare for the next move.

5. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the stolen coin in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal without being killed or caught by the Guard.
