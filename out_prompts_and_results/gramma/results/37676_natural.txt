To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero**: The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the hero who is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the hero, which is a valuable item that can be sold or used for leverage.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp**: After robbing the hero, the bandit will leave the market and head back to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the medicine and any coins she may have.

3. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit can store the medicine in the chest, ensuring it is safe and that she has achieved her goal of having valuable items secured.

4. **The bandit retrieves the coins from the chest**: If the bandit has coins in the chest, she can take them out, further achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The actions are necessary to ensure the bandit successfully robs the hero, secures the medicine, and either carries or stores coins, fulfilling her objective.
