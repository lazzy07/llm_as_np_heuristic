Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action. He aims the rifle at the bank clerk, who is standing in front of him with the money. Bubba, wanting to have the money, steals the clerk's money while threatening him with the loaded rifle. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money without resistance. 

Now, Bubba has the money he desired, and the story ends with Bubba achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to take the clerk's money by force, ensuring he achieves his goal of having money. However, since the goal is to have Bubba with the money or Bambi dead, this action is not included in the final plan as it leads to unnecessary violence.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is the most direct way for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money without killing anyone, which aligns with the goal of the story.
