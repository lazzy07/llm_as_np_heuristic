To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit starts at the Cottage and walks to the Crossroads to confront the Merchant, who has a coin.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs the Merchant, taking the coin she is carrying. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks back to the Bandit Camp to secure the stolen coin in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit places the stolen coin into the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit first walks to the Crossroads to encounter the Merchant, who is the only character with a coin available for robbery.
- The robbery is executed successfully because the Merchant is unarmed, allowing the Bandit to take the coin without any resistance.
- The Bandit then walks back to the Bandit Camp to ensure the coin is safely stored, which is crucial for her goal.
- Finally, placing the coin in the chest at the Bandit Camp completes her objective of accumulating coins.
