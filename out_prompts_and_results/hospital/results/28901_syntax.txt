To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young is currently unassigned to an exam room, and Hathaway needs to know what treatment is required.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to confirm their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment. Since Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics.

6. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to confirm their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

7. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room B. This is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Jones.
