Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, realizes that she needs to assess Ross, who is in Admissions. She walks to Admissions to admit Young to an exam room, increasing her workload to 3. Then, she assesses Ross in Patient Room B, where she mistakenly believes he is experiencing Flaze due to her high workload. She treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect, and he dies. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Jones, who is experiencing Unknown symptoms. Since she is still at a workload of 3, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis and treats him with steroids, which is also incorrect, and he dies. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. With her workload now at 2, she correctly assesses Young and finds he has Flaze. She treats him with antibiotics, and he becomes healthy.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's actions are aimed at assessing and treating the patients to ensure their health. However, due to her high workload, she makes mistakes with Ross and Jones, leading to their deaths. Ultimately, she successfully treats Young, achieving her goal of having at least one patient healthy.
