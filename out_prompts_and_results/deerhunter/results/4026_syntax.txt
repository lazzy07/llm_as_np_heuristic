To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and has already eaten Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and he has the means (a loaded rifle) to intimidate the clerk into giving it to him.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is included to show that Bubba is moving to a safe location after committing the theft.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already confirmed dead from the previous actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to fulfill his greed by taking the money from the clerk, ensuring he has the money he desires.
- **go**: This action is included to indicate Bubba's movement after the theft, but it is not necessary for achieving the goal of having the money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, House)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
