To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is important to ensure that both patients are treated correctly.

3. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also recovers.

Now, let's assume that Ross has Flaze (fever) and Young has Jarkis (rash). The actions will be as follows:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: This will reveal that Ross has a fever (symptom of Flaze).
2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: This will reveal that Young has a rash (symptom of Jarkis).
3. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: This will cure Ross of Flaze.
4. **Treat Young with steroids**: This will cure Young of Jarkis.

After these actions, both Ross and Young will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Ross**: Necessary to determine his condition and decide on treatment.
- **Assessing Young**: Necessary to determine his condition and decide on treatment.
- **Treating Ross**: Essential to cure him based on the identified disease.
- **Treating Young**: Essential to cure him based on the identified disease.
