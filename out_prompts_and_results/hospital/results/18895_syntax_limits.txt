To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, or if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway walks into PatientRoomB where Jones is located and assesses him. This action is essential to identify the disease Jones may have, which is a prerequisite for effective treatment.

- **Treat Jones in PatientRoomB**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate medication. If Jones has Flaze, he receives antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis, he receives steroids. This action ensures that Jones is treated correctly and becomes healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway successfully diagnoses and treats Jones, achieving the goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
