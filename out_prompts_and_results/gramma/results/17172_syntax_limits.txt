To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to leave the market and head to the cottage. Since he is currently at the market with the medicine he looted from the merchant, he can simply walk to the cottage.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to leave the market, where he is currently located, and head directly to the cottage, which is his desired location. Since he is already carrying the medicine, this action fulfills his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

This is the complete story with the necessary action:
