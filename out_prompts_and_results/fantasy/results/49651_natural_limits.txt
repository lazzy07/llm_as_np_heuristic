In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are all present. Talia is unhappy and desires wealth. Vince has the money but is not wealthy enough to satisfy Talia's desires. Gargax, the dragon, is also present and wants to be wealthy.

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to take the money he had without any opposition. Since Gargax wants wealth and does not care about happiness, he will eat Vince to gain the money.

2. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body.** This action allows Talia to acquire the money that Vince had, which will contribute to her wealth and ultimately make her happy.

After these actions, Talia becomes wealthy, which fulfills her goal of wanting to be wealthy and consequently makes her happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince:** This action is crucial as it eliminates Vince, who is the only character with money that Talia can access. Gargax's goal of wealth aligns with this action, as he does not care about happiness.
- **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body:** This action allows Talia to achieve her goal of wealth, which directly contributes to her happiness.
