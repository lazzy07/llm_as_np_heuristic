To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room so that Hathaway can assess and treat him. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: Similar to Ross, Jones needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, which is still manageable but will require careful assessment to avoid mistakes.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. Since Young is already in Exam Room A, this action is straightforward and necessary for treatment.

4. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the next treatment step.

6. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, making him healthy.

7. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

8. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Jones shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, making him healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
