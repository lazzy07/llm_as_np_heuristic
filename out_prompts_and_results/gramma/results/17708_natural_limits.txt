The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero and the merchant at the crossroads. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine, which she desires, she decides to take action. The bandit approaches the merchant and, using her sword, she robs the merchant, taking the medicine from her.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit robs the merchant because her goal is to carry as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. By taking the medicine, she can potentially sell it for coins or use it to further her criminal activities. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring valuable items.
