Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they want to ensure their safety and health while also fostering a friendship. 

To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship to gather supplies that could help them both. However, this action makes the Lizard feel uneasy, as it reminds him of the potential dangers of teleportation. 

Zoe teleports from the surface to her spaceship, and upon arrival, she realizes that she needs to return quickly to reassure the Lizard and continue building their friendship. She gathers some supplies and teleports back to the surface, where the Lizard is waiting.

Once back on the surface, Zoe offers the supplies to the Lizard, which helps to solidify their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy.
