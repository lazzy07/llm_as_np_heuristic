Hawkins stands on the island, clutching the treasure he has just dug up. Silver, still believing that Hawkins has the treasure, approaches him with a grin, thinking he can convince Hawkins to share the spoils. 

Hawkins, knowing that Silver is a pirate and might try to take the treasure by force, decides to play along. He pretends to be open to sharing the treasure, saying, "We could split it if you help me get back to the port safely." 

Silver, eager to get his hands on the treasure, agrees to help Hawkins sail back to Port Royal. They work together to sail the ship back to the port. Once they arrive, Hawkins quickly makes a plan to keep the treasure safe. 

As they dock, Hawkins thanks Silver for his help and, while Silver is distracted, he slips the treasure into a hidden compartment of the ship. Hawkins then tells Silver that he will go to get the rest of the crew to help carry the treasure. 

While Silver waits, Hawkins sneaks away with the treasure, successfully keeping it for himself. 

In this story, each action is necessary to ensure Hawkins achieves his goal of keeping the treasure. By pretending to cooperate with Silver, Hawkins buys time to secure the treasure and ultimately escape with it.
