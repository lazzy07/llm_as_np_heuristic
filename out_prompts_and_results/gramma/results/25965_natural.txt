### Story Completion

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit wants to be at the market to potentially rob the merchant or the guard, aiming to acquire more coins.

2. **The bandit attacks the merchant.**  
   - The bandit is armed and sees an opportunity to rob the unarmed merchant, which aligns with her goal of acquiring coins.

3. **The bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse.**  
   - After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit takes the medicine, which is valuable and can be sold or used.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit returns to her camp with the medicine, ensuring her safety and allowing her to store her loot.

5. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard, unaware of the bandit's actions, moves to the crossroads to search for the bandit.

6. **The hero walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The hero, believing the merchant is still at the crossroads, goes to check on her.

7. **The hero finds the merchant's corpse and reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - The hero, realizing the merchant has been attacked, informs the guard about the bandit’s whereabouts, which is a noble action but does not directly help the merchant achieve her goal.

### Explanation of Actions
- The bandit’s actions are focused on acquiring coins and valuable items, which is her primary goal. By attacking the merchant, she successfully robs her and takes the medicine, which can be sold for coins.
- The guard and hero's actions are more about responding to the situation rather than achieving their own goals. The guard is trying to maintain order, while the hero is trying to help the merchant, but ultimately, the merchant's goal is not achieved as she is dead.
