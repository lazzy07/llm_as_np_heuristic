To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is crucial because Alex wants the flowers (I1), and Casey has the chocolates, which Alex needs to be happy.

3. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21) with the chocolates. This is necessary for Alex to be in a position to interact with Blake.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action is important because it allows Blake to be happy, which is also a goal for Alex.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the living room (R21) where Alex is. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex.

6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex is happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
