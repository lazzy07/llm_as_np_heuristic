**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that both Ross and Young are still in the admissions room and need to be assigned to exam rooms, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assessed and treated.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the exact disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is now at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake in the assessment.

Despite the risk, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and mistakenly believes Young has Flaze due to the high workload. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Young actually has unknown symptoms. However, since Young is still alive, the treatment does not lead to death.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. Hathaway then walks back to Patient Room A to assess Ross. Again, Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway, still under the pressure of workload, mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is also incorrect, but Ross remains alive.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to assess Jones. Since Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats Jones with antibiotics. Fortunately, Jones is alive, and the treatment does not lead to death.

In the end, all patients remain alive, and Dr. Hathaway has done their best to treat them, even if some treatments were incorrect.
