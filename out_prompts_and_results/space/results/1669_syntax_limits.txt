Zoe, having just made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To ensure both her safety and the Lizard's, she decides to teleport back to her spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and plan for future interactions with the Lizard.

**Action: teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**  
- This action is taken because Zoe wants to ensure her safety by returning to the spaceship, which is a safe location away from the erupting volcano. It also allows her to think about how to foster a friendship with the Lizard in a safer environment.

After teleporting to the ship, Zoe can devise a plan to return to the surface later, once the volcano has calmed down, and continue building her friendship with the Lizard.
