To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the dangerous surface. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being safe.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe location, reinforcing their friendship.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can further solidify their friendship in a safe environment. This action is important for both characters to feel secure and connected.

5. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, which is a natural event that emphasizes the danger of the surface. However, since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, they remain unharmed. This action highlights the importance of their earlier decisions to move to a safer location.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
