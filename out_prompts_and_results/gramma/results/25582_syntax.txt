To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom will walk directly to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Tom to reach the cottage with the medicine he has taken from the merchant. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, as they are either focused on their own goals or are not in a position to stop him.
