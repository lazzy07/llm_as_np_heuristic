To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R22) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) currently has it. 

The simplest action to achieve Alex's goal is for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) is no longer holding the jewelry but is still not happy since they want the chocolates (I2).
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy as they want the flowers (I3).

This action is necessary and sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"]
}
