To achieve Vince's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to be in the same location as Talia and Rory, who are both at the village. Being in the village allows him to interact with them and potentially increase his happiness.

2. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is crucial because it results in Vince's death. Although it seems counterintuitive, Vince's death will allow Gargax to take the money from Vince's body, which will fulfill Gargax's desire to be wealthy and not hungry. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, this action does not affect Gargax's goals negatively.

3. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth. With the money taken from Vince, Gargax becomes wealthy and not hungry, fulfilling his desires.

4. **Talia and Rory remain at the village.**  
   - Talia and Rory's situation remains unchanged, as their goals are not directly affected by Vince's actions. They are still married to each other and to Talia, but their happiness remains at 0.

In this story, Vince's goal of being happy is not achieved due to his death, but he does not become hungry or wealthy. Gargax, however, achieves his goals through the actions taken.
