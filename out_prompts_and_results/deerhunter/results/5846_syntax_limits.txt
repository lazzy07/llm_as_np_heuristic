Bubba, having just stolen the rifle from the bank clerk, realizes he is hungry and decides to eat the deer he shot earlier. He goes back to the forest where Bambi lies dead and eats the animal.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where Bambi is, as he needs to be in the forest to eat the deer.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger by consuming the dead deer, which is a necessary step for him to achieve his goal of feeling full.

By eating Bambi, Bubba addresses his hunger, which is a critical need for him, allowing him to focus on his greed for money afterward.
