To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is important for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Jones from Admissions to Exam Room A**: After treating the other patients, Hathaway will walk Jones to Exam Room A to assess him. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on the symptoms assessed, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This ensures that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
