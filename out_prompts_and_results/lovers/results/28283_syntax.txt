To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Casey moves to the dining room (R21)**: This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.
2. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R21)**: This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is essential for their happiness.
3. **Casey moves back to the living room (R22)**: This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but allows for potential interactions with Alex and Blake, who are also in the living room.
4. **Casey tells Alex that they have the jewelry (I1) in the living room (R22)**: This action is to inform Alex of their success in obtaining the item they wanted, which may also contribute to Alex's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room to access the jewelry.
2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room.
