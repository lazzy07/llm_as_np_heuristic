To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse**: The bandit takes the medicine from the dead merchant. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal, and the merchant is currently dead, making it possible for the bandit to loot her.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp**: The bandit moves to her camp with the medicine. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the medicine in her possession.

3. **The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads**: The bandit returns to the crossroads. This action is necessary for the bandit to be in a position to interact with Tom.

5. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage**: Tom moves back to the cottage with the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location.
