**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, decides to assess Ross first since he is already assigned to Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, this action is necessary to gather information about Ross's condition.

2. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease. However, this is necessary to gather information about Young's condition.

4. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

5. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

6. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease. However, this is necessary to gather information about Jones's condition.

7. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. Since Ross is alive and has unknown symptoms, this treatment is a reasonable assumption. If Ross has Flaze, he will become healthy.

8. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, assuming he has Jarkis. Since Young is alive and has unknown symptoms, this treatment is a reasonable assumption. If Young has Jarkis, he will become healthy.

9. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. Since Jones is alive and has unknown symptoms, this treatment is a reasonable assumption. If Jones has Flaze, he will become healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway ensures that all patients are assessed and treated, leading to their health.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing each patient is crucial to determine their condition, even if the symptoms are unknown.
- Admitting patients to exam rooms is necessary for proper treatment.
- Treating patients with the assumed diseases based on their unknown symptoms is a calculated risk to ensure they become healthy.
