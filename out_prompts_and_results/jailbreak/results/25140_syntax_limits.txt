After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully earlier. Feeling threatened, he decides to take action. 

Roy quickly crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he sees the bully, who is unaware of his presence.
