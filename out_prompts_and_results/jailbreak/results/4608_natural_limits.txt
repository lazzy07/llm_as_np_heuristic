Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his survival. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym and believes that he can use this opportunity to escape. 

Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards when he makes his escape.
