To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the Forest to the Bank to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal the money. This action is necessary as it brings Bubba to the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money, and it also enables Bubba to take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is the final step to ensure that Bubba has the money, fulfilling the goal.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome of Bubba having the money.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can access the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money, achieving the goal of having it.
