To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The simplest way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is already at the bank and the clerk has 1 money. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk directly and prepare to steal the money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, which will allow him to take the money without resistance.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

### Explanation of Actions:
