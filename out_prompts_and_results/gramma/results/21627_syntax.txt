To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where Tom is located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to confront Tom to achieve her goal of obtaining coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of the coins he is carrying. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads. This is necessary for the Bandit to move back to a location where she can access her camp.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks to the Camp, where she can store her coins. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her loot.

5. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit places the coins she took from Tom into the chest at the Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.
