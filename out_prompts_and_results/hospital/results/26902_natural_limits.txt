Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, decides to assess Ross, who is in the same room. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, they can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Ross is experiencing a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. 

Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to an exam room. Since Jones is currently in Admissions and is alive, Hathaway can assign him to Patient Room B. 

This sequence of actions ensures that both Ross is treated successfully and Jones is admitted for further assessment, allowing Hathaway to work towards the health of all patients.
