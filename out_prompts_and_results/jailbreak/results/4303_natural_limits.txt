**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison came to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, stood in the hallway, clutching the stolen pack of cigarettes. He knew that the bully was in the gym, and he had to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. 

Roy decided to crawl through the vents to reach the gym. He knew that if he could lock the gym door behind him, he could confront the bully without the threat of being interrupted. 

Once inside the gym, Roy quickly locked the door, trapping the bully inside with him. The bully, realizing he was locked in, turned to face Roy with a menacing glare. But Roy had a plan. He reached for the knife he had hidden in his clothes, ready to defend himself and Ernest.

With a swift motion, Roy confronted the bully and, in a moment of desperation, he used the knife to kill the bully. The threat was eliminated, and Roy was now free to escape.

With the bully dead, Roy could now safely make his way to the highway. He slipped out of the gym, still disguised, and headed towards the exit.
