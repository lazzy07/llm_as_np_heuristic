To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Since Young is still in the admissions room, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room (Exam Room B) to ensure he can be assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify his condition and provide appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This is also necessary for Ross to become healthy.

7. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
