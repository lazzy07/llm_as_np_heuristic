To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on the surface and have made peace, the next step is to ensure they both remain safe from the dangerous environment. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe knows that the surface is dangerous, and to ensure both she and the Lizard are safe, she decides to start the eruption of the volcano. This action is necessary to create a sense of urgency for both characters to leave the surface.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After starting the eruption, Zoe walks back to her spaceship. This action is crucial for her safety as the surface becomes increasingly dangerous.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, seeing the eruption and understanding the danger, walks to the cave for safety. This action ensures that the Lizard also finds a safe place.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Ship)**: Once Zoe is safely on her ship, she reaches out to the Lizard to solidify their friendship. This action is essential for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports the Lizard to her spaceship, ensuring that they are both safe together. This action completes the goal of ensuring safety and friendship.

The actions are designed to ensure that both characters achieve their goals of safety and friendship while navigating the dangerous environment of the planet.
