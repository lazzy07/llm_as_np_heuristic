In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Alex will have the chocolates (I2) and will still be unhappy since they wanted the flowers (I1).
- Blake's happiness is not directly affected by this trade, but they still want Alex to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken in the story:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R21)**: This action allows Casey to get the jewelry they want, making them happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R21)"]
}
``` 

This is the shortest story that ensures Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
