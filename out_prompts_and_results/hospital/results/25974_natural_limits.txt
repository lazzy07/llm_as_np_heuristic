Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing and treating the patients she has already admitted. She first assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, discovering that he has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: After identifying Ross's symptoms, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B, preparing to assess him next. This action is necessary to manage her workload and ensure that all patients receive attention.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring he is healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
