In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in the hospital admissions room and has a workload of 3. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients assigned to the exam rooms. 

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room B and assesses Young. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Young is necessary to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis. 

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action reduces Hathaway's workload by one and ensures that Young becomes healthy.

By taking these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Young, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
