In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the dining room (R21), while Casey and Blake are in the living room (R22) with the flowers. 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action is taken:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room where Casey and Blake are located. This action is necessary because the flowers are in the same room as Casey and Blake, and Alex needs to be in that room to interact with them.

After this action, Alex can then pick up the flowers from Casey or Blake, which would make Alex happy. However, since the goal is to keep the story short and focused on Alex achieving their goal, we will stop here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: This action is essential for Alex to reach the location where the flowers are, allowing them to eventually obtain the item they want.
