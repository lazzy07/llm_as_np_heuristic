To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential target.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba returns to the bank to confront the clerk. Since Bubba is hungry and wants money, he needs to take action against the clerk to obtain the money.

3. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is crucial because Bubba needs to have a loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining 1 money.

5. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any potential confrontation with the clerk.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully obtains the money he desires while also maintaining a level of safety by leaving the bank afterward.
