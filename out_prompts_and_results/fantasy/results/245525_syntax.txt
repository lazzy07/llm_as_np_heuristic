To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia is currently in the Village, and she has accepted proposals from both Vince and Rory. However, she has not yet married either of them, which is necessary for her happiness. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave where Vince is located. This is necessary because she needs to be with Vince to marry him.
   
2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince in the Cave. This action makes Talia happy, as she has now fulfilled her relationship goal.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the Village with Talia. This is necessary for Talia to be in a location where she can access the money.

4. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action increases Talia's wealth, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Vince, and she will also be wealthy because she has taken the money.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia needs to be with Vince to marry him, so she travels to the Cave.

- **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Talia and Vince need to return to the Village to access the money.
