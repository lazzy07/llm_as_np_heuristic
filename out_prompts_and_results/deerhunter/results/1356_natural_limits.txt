Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money. He points the rifle at the bank clerk and demands the money. The clerk, realizing the danger, hands over the money to Bubba. With the money in hand, Bubba leaves the bank, satisfied with his acquisition.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not taken because Bubba's goal is to get money, and shooting the clerk would not be necessary if the clerk willingly gives him the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is taken as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money without unnecessary violence.
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: This action is taken to signify that Bubba has successfully left the bank with the money, completing his objective.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, achieving his goal.
