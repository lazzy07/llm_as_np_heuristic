Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to confront the Lizard and try to establish a friendship. She teleports from the ship to the surface, where she finds the Lizard. The Lizard, believing Zoe is still at the ship, is surprised to see her. 

Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to communicate, expressing her desire for friendship and understanding. The Lizard, initially wary, listens to Zoe's intentions. As they talk, the volcano begins to rumble ominously, indicating an imminent eruption. 

Seeing the danger, Zoe suggests they work together to find safety. The Lizard, realizing that Zoe is not a threat and shares the same goal of safety, agrees. They both decide to walk towards the cave, where they can find shelter from the eruption. 

As they walk, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. In the chaos, Zoe and the Lizard manage to reach the cave just in time, but the eruption causes a rockslide that blocks the entrance. Zoe is injured in the process, but the Lizard uses its strength to shield Zoe from falling debris, ultimately sacrificing itself to save her.

In the aftermath, Zoe, now safe but grieving, reflects on the Lizard's bravery and realizes that they had formed a bond through their shared experience. She vows to honor the Lizard's memory by protecting the planet and its creatures.
