**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room C with a workload of 2. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Young, who is currently unassigned and has an unknown symptom. This action is necessary to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.
   
2. **Assess Jones**: After assessing Young, Hathaway assesses Jones in the admissions room. This is important to check for any symptoms that could indicate either disease.

3. **Treat Young**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This is crucial for Young's recovery.

4. **Treat Jones**: If Jones is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. This ensures that both patients are treated appropriately based on their symptoms.

5. **Final Assessment**: Hathaway checks the health status of both Young and Jones to confirm they are now healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.
- **Assess Jones**: Similar to Young, assessing Jones is essential to ensure he receives the correct treatment.
- **Treat Young**: If Young has Flaze, treating him with antibiotics is the correct course of action to ensure he becomes healthy.
- **Treat Jones**: If Jones has Jarkis, treating him with steroids is necessary for his recovery.
- **Final Assessment**: This confirms that both patients are healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
