To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary to create distance from the bank and potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.
