To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is an easy target since he is unarmed.

2. **Walk to Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest. This is essential for securing the coins and achieving her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coin he is carrying. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count, moving her closer to her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest, ensuring that they are safe and contributing to her goal of having coins in the camp.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by following these two actions.
