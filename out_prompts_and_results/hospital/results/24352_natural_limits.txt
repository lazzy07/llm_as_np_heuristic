Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Young. Since both are in Admissions and their symptoms are unknown, Hathaway assesses Jones first. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Jones has Jarkis due to the rash symptom. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully curing him as well.
