**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant at the crossroads. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine, the bandit decides to attack the merchant to take the medicine for herself.

1. The bandit attacks the merchant. (This action is necessary for the bandit to take the medicine, which is her goal.)
2. The bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant. (After successfully attacking, the bandit can take the medicine, fulfilling her goal of acquiring valuable items.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit attacks the merchant because she needs to eliminate a non-armed character to take the medicine. This is a direct action towards achieving her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible.
- After the merchant is defeated, the bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse, which is a necessary step to ensure she has the item she desires.
