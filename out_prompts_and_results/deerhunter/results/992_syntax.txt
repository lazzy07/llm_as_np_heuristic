To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank to confront the bank clerk.
   - **Explanation**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to get the money from the clerk.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money.
   - **Explanation**: Since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he will use the rifle to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will confirm his desire to have the money.
   - **Explanation**: This action solidifies Bubba's greed and ensures he acknowledges his new wealth.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will remain dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also confirming that Bambi is dead, thus satisfying the conditions of the story.
