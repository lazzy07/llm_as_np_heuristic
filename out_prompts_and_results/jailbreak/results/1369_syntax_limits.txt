Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his goal of having a pack of cigarettes. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that he has the cigarettes. To avoid confrontation, Ernest locks the gym door, preventing the bully from coming out and threatening him or Roy. 

With the gym locked, Ernest feels a sense of relief and can now focus on his next steps without the immediate threat of the bully. He then decides to disguise himself with the civilian clothes he stole earlier, which will allow him to escape the prison without being recognized. 

Finally, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway, where he can put on the civilian clothes and escape from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
