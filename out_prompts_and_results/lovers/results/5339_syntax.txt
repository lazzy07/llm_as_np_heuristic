To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Blake involved.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, which means Alex is happy. 

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: While this does not directly affect Alex's happiness, it keeps Blake in the story and allows for potential future interactions.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:
