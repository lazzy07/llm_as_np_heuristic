After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain some energy. However, he is still focused on his greed and the desire for money. 

Next, Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk. Since he is now in a position of power with the rifle, he can threaten the clerk to get the money. 

Bubba goes to the bank and, with the rifle loaded, he steals the money from the clerk. This action fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba goes to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the clerk using the rifle as a threat.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of getting money while also addressing his hunger.
