To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the bedroom (R12) and does not have the flowers, which are currently with Casey (C2) in the dining room (R22). 

The simplest action to achieve this is for Alex to move to the dining room and pick up the flowers. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bedroom to the dining room where the flowers are located. This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the flowers.
2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers and will be happy.
