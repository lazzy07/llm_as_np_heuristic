To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must first find the gun, then move to the same location as the mastermind, and finally kill the mastermind. Here’s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **find(SecretAgent, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent needs to find the gun to be able to kill the mastermind. Since the gun is not currently with any character, the secret agent must discover it in the lobby.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Cache)**: After finding the gun, the secret agent needs to move to the cache to confront the mastermind. The mastermind is not in the lobby, so the agent must go to a location where they can potentially find the mastermind.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Cache, Office)**: The secret agent moves from the cache to the office, as the office is a location where the mastermind could be hiding.

4. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: Finally, the secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the office.

Now, the story is complete, and the mastermind is dead. Each action is necessary to ensure the secret agent can successfully eliminate the mastermind.
