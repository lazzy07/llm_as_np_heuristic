To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to make peace and become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe begins by walking towards the Lizard.** This action is necessary to initiate a conversation and potentially resolve their differences, as they are currently not fighting.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This action is inevitable and will lead to the death of one character. Since the surface is already dangerous, the eruption will create a catastrophic situation.

4. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** This action concludes the story with Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

The sequence of actions ensures that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption occurs, allowing for a positive resolution to their relationship, even as the story ends tragically with Zoe's death.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard to facilitate communication.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with their mutual goals of safety and companionship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation that leads to the next action.
- **kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)**: Zoe dies as a result of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story. 

This sequence effectively meets the story's requirements while maintaining a coherent narrative.
