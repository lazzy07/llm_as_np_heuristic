Zoe and the Lizard are both on the surface of the planet, and they have already made peace with each other. However, the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe needs to take action quickly.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where it is safer from the volcanic activity. This action is necessary to avoid the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important for the Lizard to stay safe and to continue building their friendship with Zoe.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their friendship in a safe environment. It ensures that they both feel secure and connected.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is crucial for her goal of being healthy and safe.

5. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Cave)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship to join Zoe. This action allows the Lizard to also be safe and continue their friendship with Zoe.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
