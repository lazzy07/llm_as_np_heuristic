To complete the story where the Lizard achieves their goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are not enemies.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the cave, which is a safer location away from the dangerous surface where the volcano is beginning to erupt. This action helps the Lizard to ensure its safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave, ensuring that she is also safe from the erupting volcano. This action reinforces their friendship as they choose to stay together in a safer location.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is necessary to show the danger that was present on the surface and to highlight the importance of their decision to move to the cave.

By completing these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe, while also solidifying their friendship.
