To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave where the treasure is located, and she is married to both Rory and Vince. Since Vince has the money, he can help Talia achieve her goals.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia becoming happy or wealthy:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure.** (Rory is at the cave with Talia and can pick up the treasure.)
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and it will help Talia become wealthy.

2. **Rory gives the treasure to Talia.** (Rory can give the treasure to Talia since they are married.)
   - This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

3. **Talia becomes happy.** (Talia's happiness increases because she now has the treasure.)
   - This action is implied as a result of Talia receiving the treasure, fulfilling her desire to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Rory picks up the treasure:** This allows Talia to potentially become wealthy.
- **Rory gives the treasure to Talia:** This directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.
- **Talia becomes happy:** This is the result of Talia receiving the treasure, fulfilling her goal of happiness.

With these actions, Talia achieves her goals of becoming both happy and wealthy.
