Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young is experiencing a fever, which indicates that Young has Flaze. This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine the correct treatment for Young.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Young's recovery and fulfills Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring patient health.

3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room, allowing for future assessment and treatment.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A. This action is also necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room, allowing for future assessment and treatment.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, and sets up the potential for treating Jones and Ross in the future.
