To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom carries the medicine.**  
   - This action is implicit in the first action since Tom already looted the medicine from the merchant. He now has the medicine with him as he walks to the cottage.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage while carrying the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking from the crossroads to the cottage** is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal. Since he already has the medicine, he simply needs to move to the cottage.
