To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will loot the coins from the Merchant's corpse. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to go to the bandit camp, thus achieving her goal of carrying coins.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully loots the coins from the Merchant and then takes the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of having coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting the Merchant**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain coins immediately after the Merchant is killed, which is a direct way to increase her wealth.
- **Taking from the Chest**: This action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, which is another aspect of her goal.
