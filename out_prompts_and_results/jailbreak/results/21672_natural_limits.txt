Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway with a knife. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Roy is in the cells with the stolen cigarettes. To ensure his safety and achieve his goal of being alive and free, Ernest decides to lock the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening him or Roy further.

After locking the gym door, Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself further. With the disguise on, he successfully escapes from the prison, ensuring his safety and achieving his goal of being alive.
