To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a loaded rifle, and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money without resistance. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only obstacle to Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a condition that has been established in the story.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can now focus on his greed and decide to take the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and the previous actions taken to eliminate the clerk.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **shoot**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **eat**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a condition he has.
- **decide_to_get_money**: Reinforces Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **pickup**: Finalizes the action of obtaining the money.
