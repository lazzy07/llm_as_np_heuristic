To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and it will lead to Rory's death. Although it seems counterintuitive, this action will allow Rory to become wealthy through the treasure Talia possesses, as Rory will be able to take the treasure from Talia's dead body later.

2. **Talia takes the money from Rory's dead body**: After Rory is dead, Talia can take the money from Rory. This action is essential for Talia to become wealthy, which indirectly contributes to Rory's goal of wealth since Talia will be able to share her wealth with Rory in the afterlife.

3. **Talia proposes to Vince**: Talia, now wealthy, proposes to Vince. This action is necessary for Talia to seek happiness through marriage, which is also a step towards Rory's happiness as Talia's happiness can reflect on Rory's spirit.

4. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal**: Vince accepts Talia's proposal, leading to both characters being happy. This action is crucial for Talia's happiness, which indirectly fulfills Rory's goal of happiness as well.

5. **Talia and Vince get married**: This action solidifies Talia's happiness and wealth, which can be seen as a fulfillment of Rory's goal of happiness through Talia's success.

In summary, the actions taken lead to Rory's death, which allows Talia to gain wealth and happiness through marriage to Vince. Rory's goal of being wealthy is achieved through Talia's actions after his death.
