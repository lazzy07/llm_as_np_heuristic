Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess each patient in the admissions room to identify their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B.** This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room A.** This action assigns Young to an exam room, allowing for his assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 4.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room C.** This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms. However, due to Dr. Hathaway's workload being 3 or more, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** Assuming Jones has a rash (which is incorrect due to the previous assessment mistake), Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. This results in Jones dying, which is not ideal but necessary for the story's progression.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as a fever and administers antibiotics, successfully making Ross healthy. This action is essential to achieve Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a fever and administers antibiotics, successfully making Young healthy as well.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has treated two patients successfully, achieving the goal of ensuring that at least some patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
