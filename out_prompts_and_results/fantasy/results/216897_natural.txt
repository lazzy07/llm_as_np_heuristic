To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave, where the treasure is located. The following sequence of actions will lead to Talia's success:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can provide her with wealth.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to return to the village to interact with Rory and Vince, who are both there and can help her achieve happiness.

3. **Talia proposes marriage to Rory.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is symbolic, but it reinforces her commitment to Rory, which is important for her happiness.

4. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action ensures that both Talia and Rory are happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

5. **Talia and Rory get married.**  
   - This formalizes their relationship and solidifies Talia's happiness.

6. **Talia takes the money from Vince's body.**  
   - Since Vince is alive, this action cannot happen. Instead, we will assume that Talia convinces Vince to give her the money, which is necessary for her to achieve her goal of wealth.

7. **Vince gives Talia the money.**  
   - This action allows Talia to become wealthy, as she now has the money.

At the end of these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to the treasure and the money from Vince).
