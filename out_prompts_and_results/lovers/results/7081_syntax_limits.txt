In the current situation, Casey (C3) is in the bedroom (R11) and wants the jewelry (I3) that is currently with Alex (C1) in the same room. To achieve their goal of being happy, Casey needs to get the jewelry. 

Here’s the action that will help Casey achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R11)**: Casey can trade the item they have (flowers, I1) with Alex for the item they want (jewelry, I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy as well since they have given away the item they were holding.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey gets the jewelry they want, fulfilling their desire for happiness.
