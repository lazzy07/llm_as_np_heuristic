To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.** - This action is necessary because Rory needs to increase his happiness, and marrying Talia will fulfill that requirement.
  
2. **Talia accepts the proposal.** - Talia's acceptance is crucial for both characters to become happy through marriage.

3. **Rory and Talia get married.** - This solidifies their relationship and ensures that both Rory and Talia are happy.

4. **Rory picks up the treasure.** - Rory already has the money, and picking up the treasure will increase his wealth, which is part of his goal.

5. **Rory travels to the village.** - Rory needs to be in the village to ensure he is not hungry, as Gargax is there and could potentially eat him if he stays in the cave.

6. **Rory gives the money to Gargax.** - By giving the money to Gargax, Rory can appease the dragon, ensuring his safety and preventing Gargax from being hungry.

7. **Rory gives the treasure to Gargax.** - This further ensures that Gargax is satisfied and will not pose a threat to Rory.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage), wealthy (by having both money and treasure), and not hungry (by ensuring Gargax is satisfied).
