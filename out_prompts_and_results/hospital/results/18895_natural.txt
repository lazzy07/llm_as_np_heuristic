**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C, allowing him to be treated. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but he can still manage it.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is alive, he survives the treatment and becomes healthy. This reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross in Patient Room C with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Since Ross is alive, he also survives the treatment and becomes healthy.

At this point, both patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved his goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
