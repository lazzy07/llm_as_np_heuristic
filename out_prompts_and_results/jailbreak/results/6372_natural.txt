**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, so he has a moment to act without immediate danger.

1. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to move more freely without being recognized as a prisoner.)
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This allows him to escape the prison without being seen by the bully or guards.)
3. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the civilian clothes on, he successfully leaves the prison and is now safe.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Putting on civilian clothes**: This is crucial for Ernest to avoid being recognized as a prisoner when he escapes.
- **Crawling through the vents**: This action allows him to bypass the locked gym and any potential encounters with the bully or guards.
- **Escaping from the prison**: This is the ultimate goal for Ernest, ensuring his survival and freedom.
