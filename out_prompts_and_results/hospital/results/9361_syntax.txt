To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat them. This will also increase Hathaway's workload to 3, which is important for the next steps.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in Exam Room A, this action is straightforward and necessary for diagnosis.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for diagnosis and treatment.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the last assessment needed to ensure all patients are evaluated.

5. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Young healthy.

6. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy.

7. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Jones shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Jones healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
