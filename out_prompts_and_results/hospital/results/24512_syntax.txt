To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Ross is also in the same room as Jones, and Hathaway needs to understand Ross's condition to treat him appropriately.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat Jones for the disease that matches his symptoms (SymptomB). Since Jones has a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to PatientRoomA**: Young, who is currently in the admissions room, will walk to PatientRoomA. This is necessary to ensure that Young is in the same room as Hathaway for assessment and treatment.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment for his condition.

5. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. If Young has a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is necessary for Young to also become healthy.

By following these steps, both Jones and Young will achieve their goals of being alive and healthy.
