To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure located in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her primary goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This action is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially secure her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.

4. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels back to the cave to retrieve the money he has there. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness but is included to ensure that Vince can also achieve his goal of not being hungry.

5. **take(Vince, Money, Gargax, Cave)**: Vince takes the money from Gargax, who is a dragon and is not a character that Talia is concerned with. This action ensures that Vince has the money, which he can use to help Talia in the future.

Now, Talia is happy because she is married to Vince, and she is wealthy because she has the treasure.
