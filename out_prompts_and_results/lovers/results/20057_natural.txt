To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, we can outline the following actions:

1. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex and Casey to interact with them.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.**  
   - This action is a lie, but it is intended to mislead Casey into thinking that Alex is interested in the jewelry, which may prompt Casey to act.

3. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.**  
   - Casey believes that Blake wants the jewelry, and since Blake is now in the living room, this action allows Casey to give the jewelry away.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.**  
   - Blake, now holding the jewelry, can give the chocolates to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire for the jewelry.

5. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but allows Blake to be in a different room after the exchange.

At the end of these actions, Casey has the jewelry and is happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Blake moving to the living room** allows for interaction with both Alex and Casey.
