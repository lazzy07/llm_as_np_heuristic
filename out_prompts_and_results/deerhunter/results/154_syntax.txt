To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to obtain money from the bank. Given the current situation, he is already in the bank with a loaded rifle and the bank clerk is present. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only obstacle preventing Bubba from obtaining the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to remove the bank clerk, who is a barrier to Bubba's goal of getting money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is eliminated, Bubba can safely pick up the money from the bank, fulfilling his goal of acquiring money.
