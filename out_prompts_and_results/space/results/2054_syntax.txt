To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while the volcano is about to erupt. The goal is to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano starts to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending eruption, which is a key part of the story's conclusion.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to put aside their differences and become friends. This action is crucial as it fulfills their mutual desire to make friends and ensures that they are no longer fighting.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface, where the volcano is erupting. This action is necessary for Zoe to be on the surface when the eruption occurs.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the death of Zoe, who is now on the surface. This action concludes the story with a character dying, fulfilling one of the possible endings.

The actions taken ensure that both characters achieve their goals of making friends while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, resulting in Zoe's death.
