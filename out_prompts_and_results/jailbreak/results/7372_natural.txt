**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the bully's threat, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and since he has the knife, he can confront the bully. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to enter the gym without being seen and to confront the bully.)
3. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (This action is not necessary since the gym is already locked, but it indicates he is prepared to confront the bully.)
4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the crucial action that ensures Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened by the bully.)

After killing the bully, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He now has the pack of cigarettes and the knife, and he can safely return to Roy. 

5. **Ernest returns to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for him to regroup with Roy.)
6. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to escape without being recognized.)
7. **Ernest goes to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

With the civilian clothes on, Ernest successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
