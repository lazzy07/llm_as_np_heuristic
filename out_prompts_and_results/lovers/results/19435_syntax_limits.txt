In the current situation, Casey wants to be happy and has a desire for the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). However, Casey is currently not happy because they do not possess the jewelry. 

To achieve Casey's goal, the simplest action would be for Alex to give the jewelry to Casey. Since Alex is currently in the same room as Casey (R12), this action can be performed directly.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(Alex, I3, Casey, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the living room (R12). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have made Casey happy.
- Casey will be happy because they now possess the jewelry they wanted.
- Blake's happiness is not directly affected by this action, but they will be content knowing that both Alex and Casey are happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving the jewelry is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire and leads to their happiness. Since Alex wants Casey to be happy, this action aligns with both of their goals.
