To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom can walk directly to the cottage, where he wants to be.

This sequence of actions is necessary because Tom needs to move from the market to the cottage, and the only way to do that is by first going to the crossroads and then to the cottage. There are no other characters or actions needed in this scenario since Tom already has the medicine after buying it at the market.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine he purchased.
