To achieve the secret agent's goal of killing the mastermind, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby.**  
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to be in the same location as the mastermind to carry out the kill.

2. **The secret agent picks up the gun in the lobby.**  
   - The gun is essential for the secret agent to achieve their goal of killing the mastermind. Since the gun is not mentioned as being in any other location, it must be in the lobby.

3. **The secret agent moves from the lobby to the courtyard.**  
   - This action is not necessary for the goal, but it allows the secret agent to reposition themselves strategically.

4. **The secret agent moves from the courtyard to the lobby.**  
   - The secret agent returns to the lobby to confront the mastermind.

5. **The secret agent kills the mastermind in the lobby.**  
   - This is the final action that fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that the secret agent can successfully kill the mastermind while adhering to the rules of movement and item acquisition.
