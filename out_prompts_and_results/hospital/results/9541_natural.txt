**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, this assessment is crucial to understand Young's condition.

After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing Young has Flaze due to the increased workload. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Dr. Hathaway then walks back to Patient Room C to assess Jones. Since Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway again cannot determine the disease. However, it is essential to check on Jones.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing Jones has Jarkis. This treatment is also incorrect, and Jones dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Young and Jones, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at assessing and treating all patients, fulfilling the goal of wanting all patients to be healthy, even if the results were not as intended.
