In the village, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are all present. Talia is unhappy and desires wealth. Vince has some money but is not wealthy. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and wants wealth. 

To achieve Talia's goal of happiness or wealth, the following actions take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, being hungry and wanting wealth, sees Vince as a means to fulfill his hunger. By eating Vince, Gargax not only satisfies his hunger but also takes the money that Vince had. This action is crucial because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her goals without competition for wealth.

2. **Talia picks up the money from Vince's body**: After Gargax eats Vince, Talia can now take the money that Vince had. This action directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her primary goals. With the money, Talia can now be considered wealthy, which may also lead to her happiness.

After these actions, Talia becomes wealthy, fulfilling her goal.
