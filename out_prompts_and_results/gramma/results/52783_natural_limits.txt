The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant at the crossroads. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine, which she believes could be valuable, she decides to rob the merchant. The bandit approaches the merchant and, with a swift motion, she threatens her with the sword, demanding the medicine. The merchant, unarmed and realizing the danger, hands over the medicine to the bandit without resistance. 

With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit feels accomplished. She has successfully obtained an item of value without needing to resort to violence against the merchant. The bandit then walks back to her camp, satisfied with her haul.
