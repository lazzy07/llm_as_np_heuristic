To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to access the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the bank with the stolen money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba then decides to shoot Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action is taken to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is optional but aligns with Bubba's needs.
