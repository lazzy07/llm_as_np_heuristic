To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who has just proposed to her and she accepted. Since Rory is now dead, Talia can take the treasure he has, which will make her wealthy. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Talia takes the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action makes Talia wealthy, fulfilling her goal of wanting to be wealthy.

Now, Talia is wealthy, and since she is in a relationship with Rory (even though he is dead), she can still feel a sense of happiness from their union, even if it is bittersweet.

- **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: This action is necessary because it allows Talia to acquire the treasure that Rory had, thus achieving her goal of wealth. Since Talia's happiness is tied to her wealth, this action also indirectly contributes to her happiness.
