To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the money and treasure while eliminating any threats. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action eliminates a potential threat to Gargax and allows Gargax to satisfy their hunger. Talia is a human who could potentially interfere with Gargax's plans.
  
2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body.** - Since Vince is already dead, Gargax can take the money that Vince had, which contributes to Gargax's wealth.

3. **Gargax picks up the treasure.** - The treasure is at the cave, and by picking it up, Gargax increases their wealth further.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring both the money and the treasure) and is no longer hungry (having eaten Talia).

### Explanation of Actions:
