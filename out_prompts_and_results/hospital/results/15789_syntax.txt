To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Jones without reducing their workload. However, Jones is in the admissions room, and Hathaway needs to assess them to determine their symptoms. 

2. **Walk Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will need to walk Jones to Exam Room C, where they can be treated.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Similarly, Hathaway should assess Ross to determine their symptoms. 

4. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will need to walk Ross to Exam Room B for treatment.

5. **Treat Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young is already in Exam Room A and has been assessed with SymptomB, Hathaway can treat Young with antibiotics, as they have Flaze.

6. **Treat Jones in Exam Room C**: After determining Jones's symptoms, Hathaway can treat Jones accordingly. If Jones has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids.

7. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross based on their symptoms. If Ross has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
