To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to join Talia and Rory in the village, where they can interact and potentially resolve their situations.

2. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is crucial because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Rory to focus on his relationship with Talia without competition for her affections or resources.

3. **Rory gives Talia the treasure.**  
   - By giving Talia the treasure, Rory can increase Talia's happiness, which in turn can contribute to his own happiness since they are married.

4. **Rory and Talia become happy.**  
   - This action is implicit in the previous step, as Talia's happiness increases due to receiving the treasure, which also makes Rory happy.

5. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's body.**  
   - After Vince is eaten by Gargax, Rory can take the money that Vince had, thus increasing his wealth.

6. **Rory's wealth increases.**  
   - This action is implicit in the previous step, as Rory now possesses the money, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy.

At the end of these actions, Rory is happy (due to Talia's happiness), wealthy (due to acquiring Vince's money), and not hungry (as there is no mention of hunger in the actions taken).
