To complete the story, Tom needs to return to the cottage while carrying the medicine. Since he is currently at the crossroads and has the medicine, he can simply walk back to the cottage. The other characters are either dead or not in a position to interfere with Tom's goal.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly leads Tom to his desired location with the medicine, fulfilling his objective.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

In summary, the story is completed with a single action that allows Tom to achieve his goal without any complications, as the other characters are no longer a threat.
