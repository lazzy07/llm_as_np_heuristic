To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market where Tom is located. This is necessary because the bandit needs to confront Tom to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit robs Tom of the coin he has. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to gain coins directly from Tom, which contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the camp. This is necessary for the bandit to secure the coins in her chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that the bandit has coins stored in her camp, further solidifying her goal of having coins.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The bandit walks to the market to confront Tom.
- The bandit robs Tom to acquire coins.
- The bandit walks back to the camp to secure her loot.
- The bandit takes the coins from the chest to ensure she has coins.
