**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife, which gives him an opportunity to confront the bully.

1. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully directly and take control of the situation.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (Locking the door prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that they are alone, allowing Ernest to confront him without interference.)
3. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to be safe from the bully's violence.)

With the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison with Roy.

4. **Ernest goes to the hallway.** (This action is necessary to move towards the laundry room where the civilian clothes are located.)
5. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the laundry room.** (This allows him to access the clothes without being seen by guards or other prisoners.)
6. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (Wearing the civilian clothes will disguise him, making it easier to escape.)
7. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action takes him directly to the escape route.)
8. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (This final action achieves his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure Ernest's safety and to eliminate the threat posed by the bully. The sequence of actions is designed to confront the bully, secure the environment, and ultimately escape the prison without further threats.
