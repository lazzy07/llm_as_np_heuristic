To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has accepted proposals from both Vince and Rory, she can choose to marry one of them, which will make her happy. Additionally, Vince currently has money, which can contribute to her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for her to access the treasure, which can contribute to her wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly increases her wealth.

3. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. Since she has accepted his proposal, this will make her happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Traveling to the cave** is essential because Talia needs to be in the location where the treasure is to pick it up. 
- **Picking up the treasure** is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.
- **Marrying Vince** is the final step that ensures Talia's happiness, as she has accepted his proposal.

By completing these actions, Talia will achieve both happiness and wealth.
