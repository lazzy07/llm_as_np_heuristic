To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures a cooperative atmosphere.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe can walk to the cave. This action is necessary for Zoe to explore the cave, which may provide a safer environment away from the dangers of the surface.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe to the cave. This action is important as it keeps both characters together in a safe location, furthering their friendship and ensuring their safety.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt. This action introduces a sense of urgency and danger, emphasizing the need for both characters to be in a safe location.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action highlights the importance of their previous decisions to move to the cave.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
