**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy sneaks back through the vent to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to return to the prison and help Ernest.)
2. **Roy moves to the gym.** (Roy needs to confront the bully to ensure he won't threaten Ernest anymore.)
3. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and allows Roy to deal with him without interference.)
4. **Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (Roy needs the knife to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action removes the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)
6. **Roy returns to the hallway.** (After dealing with the bully, Roy needs to get back to the hallway to escape.)
7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (Although he is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise before escaping.)
8. **Roy escapes to the highway.** (This final action allows Roy to successfully leave the prison and achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure Roy can eliminate the threat of the bully while also ensuring his own safety and that of Ernest. The locking of the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from retaliating. Killing the bully is the only way to ensure that both Roy and Ernest can live without fear. Finally, escaping to the highway is the culmination of Roy's efforts to achieve freedom.
