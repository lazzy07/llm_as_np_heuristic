Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she correctly identifies that Jones is experiencing Flaze due to the fever. She then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting. She assesses Ross and discovers he is experiencing Jarkis due to the rash. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully making him healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to assess Young. She finds Young is also experiencing Jarkis and treats him with steroids, making him healthy too.
