To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the Cave to the Surface. This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to confront Zoe directly to establish a relationship and ensure both characters are in the same location.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Once the Lizard is on the Surface, it will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to stop fighting and work towards friendship, which is one of the Lizard's goals.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard will then cause the volcano to erupt. This action is taken to create a sense of urgency and danger, prompting both characters to work together for survival, which can further solidify their friendship.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the Cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action ensures the Lizard's safety.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Finally, Zoe will walk to the Cave as well. This action allows Zoe to join the Lizard in a safe location, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring both characters are healthy and safe.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
