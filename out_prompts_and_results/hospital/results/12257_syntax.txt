To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomB with Jones and has a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, we need to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Jones to Admissions**: After treatment, Jones can walk to the admissions room, which is a logical step to signify that they are ready to leave the hospital.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine what disease Jones has, which is essential for the next step of treatment.
2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment for their condition, leading to their recovery.
3. **Walk(Jones, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: This action signifies that Jones is now healthy and can leave the hospital.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Assess**: This is the first step to identify Jones's condition. Without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.
- **Treat**: This is the critical action that directly impacts Jones's health. If Hathaway correctly identifies the disease as Flaze, treating with antibiotics will ensure Jones's recovery.
- **Walk**: This action represents the successful outcome of the treatment, showing that Jones is now healthy and can leave the hospital.
