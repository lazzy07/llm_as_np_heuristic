To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I3) they have with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3), which is not what they want, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, Alex is happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex gets the jewelry they want. Since Alex's happiness is contingent on having I1, this trade directly fulfills that requirement.
