**Story Completion:**

After the events that transpired, Ernest, who is currently in the hallway, knows he needs to act quickly to ensure his safety and secure a pack of cigarettes. He decides to lock the gym door to trap the bully inside, preventing any threats from him. 

1. **lock_gym(Ernest, Hall)**: By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot come out and threaten him or Roy. This action is crucial for Ernest's safety and allows him to focus on his next move without the immediate threat of the bully.

With the gym locked, Ernest can now safely make his way to the highway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier and escape from the prison.

2. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: This action allows Ernest to leave the prison entirely, achieving his goal of being alive and free. By escaping, he no longer has to worry about threats from the bully or the prison environment.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Locking the gym door is a defensive move that protects both Ernest and Roy from the bully, ensuring they are not threatened while they plan their next steps.
- Escaping to the highway is the ultimate goal for Ernest, allowing him to leave the prison and secure his life outside.
