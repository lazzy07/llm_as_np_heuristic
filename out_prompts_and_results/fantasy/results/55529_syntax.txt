To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, she can leverage her relationships to achieve her goals. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the Cave to join Talia and Rory. This is necessary because Talia needs to interact with Vince to achieve her goal of happiness or wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the Treasure in the Cave. This action is crucial because acquiring the Treasure will increase her wealth.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's goals but helps to clear the Cave for the next actions.

4. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince also travels back to the Village. This is to ensure that Talia is alone in the Cave, allowing her to focus on her next actions without interference.

5. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry, which is a natural consequence of the story's progression. This sets up the next action.

6. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia. This action is necessary to conclude the story, as it leads to Talia's death, which ultimately results in her happiness due to the fulfillment of her desires in life.

7. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Village)**: Vince takes the Money from himself, which is a redundant action but emphasizes his wealth.

In this story, Talia becomes wealthy by picking up the Treasure, and her happiness is achieved through the fulfillment of her desires, even if it leads to her demise. The actions taken are necessary to ensure Talia's goals are met, even if the outcome is tragic.
