The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the guard is now the only threat to her plans. She decides to take action to secure her goal of having as many coins as possible. 

The bandit approaches the guard and, with her sword drawn, she attacks him. The guard, unarmed against her assault, is unable to defend himself and is killed. The bandit then loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword and any coins he may have had. With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now safely return to the bandit camp with her coins and the sword.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit attacks the guard**: This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate the only character who poses a threat to her goal of collecting coins. 
2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse**: After successfully attacking the guard, this action allows the bandit to gather more coins and potentially a sword, further securing her position.

The bandit achieves her goal of having coins in her possession and can now return to the bandit camp without fear of being pursued.
