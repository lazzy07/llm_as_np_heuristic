To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of his coin. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently in the Market with a coin. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can successfully rob him.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins secured in her possession.

The sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins and having them secured in the chest at the bandit camp.
