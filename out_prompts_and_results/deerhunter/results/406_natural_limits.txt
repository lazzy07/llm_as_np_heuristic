Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has the rifle and ammunition, he loads the rifle. This action is necessary because it prepares him to shoot Bambi, which will allow him to eat and satisfy his hunger. 

Next, Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba being able to eat, fulfilling his immediate need. Afterward, Bubba decides to eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger.

Now that Bubba has eaten, he feels more capable and confident. He then decides to go back to the bank, where he knows the clerk has money. Since he is no longer hungry, he can focus on his goal of obtaining money.
