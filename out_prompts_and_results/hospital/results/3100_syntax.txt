To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment results. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment results. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

Now, let's assume the assessments reveal the following:
- Jones has Flaze (fever).
- Young has Jarkis (rash).
- Ross has Flaze (fever).

Thus, the treatments will be:
- Treat Jones with antibiotics.
- Treat Young with steroids.
- Treat Ross with antibiotics.

This sequence of actions ensures that all patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms, leading to their recovery.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Treating each patient** with the correct treatment based on their symptoms is necessary to achieve Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.
