To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and heads towards the forest. This action is taken to create distance from the bank and potentially encounter Bambi.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba uses his rifle to shoot Bambi. This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money he stole from the bank, and Bambi is dead, achieving both possible endings.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba moves to the forest to avoid any potential consequences from the bank robbery and to find Bambi.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second condition of the story.
