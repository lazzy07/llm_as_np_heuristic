To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire money. The bank clerk has money, and Bubba is currently in the forest with a loaded rifle. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the bank clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located. Without this action, he cannot interact with the bank clerk or obtain the money.
   
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money, achieving the goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead from the previous action.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
