The key to Talia's happiness lies in her relationship with Rory. Since they are married, Talia can become happy if Rory accepts the proposal. However, since Rory has already proposed, we can assume that he will accept it, leading to both characters being happy.

Now, let's outline the story with the actions taken:

1. **Rory proposes to Talia**: This has already happened.
2. **Rory accepts the proposal**: This action will make Talia happy.

After this action, Talia will be happy, and she will also retain her treasure, which contributes to her wealth.
