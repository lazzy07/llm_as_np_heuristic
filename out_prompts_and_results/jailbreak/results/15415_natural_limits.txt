As the first day in prison continued, Ernest found himself in the gym, facing the bully who had just returned from his recreation time. The bully, still furious about the stolen cigarettes, threatened Ernest, making it clear that he would not let this slide. 

Meanwhile, in the laundry room, Roy realized that the only way to protect both himself and Ernest was to act quickly. He decided to sneak into the kitchen to retrieve the knife, knowing it was the only way to defend themselves against the bully. 

Roy successfully sneaked into the kitchen, grabbed the knife, and then crawled through the vents to the gym. He emerged silently behind the bully, who was still focused on threatening Ernest. In a swift motion, Roy plunged the knife into the bully, finally getting revenge for the threats against both of them.
