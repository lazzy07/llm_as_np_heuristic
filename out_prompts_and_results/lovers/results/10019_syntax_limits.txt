In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R12)**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I1) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Alex wants. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy. Since Blake also wants to be happy, they will be satisfied with the chocolates in exchange.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- Alex will be happy because they now have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates (I1).
- Casey remains unhappy as they still do not have the item they want (I2).

This single action allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy.
