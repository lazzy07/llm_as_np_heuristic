To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will decide to steal from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to acquire the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary to create distance from the bank and potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money he stole from the clerk, and Bambi will be dead, satisfying the requirements of the story.
