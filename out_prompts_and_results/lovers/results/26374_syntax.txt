To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation shows that I2 is not in the room, and we need to get it to Blake. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to pick up the chocolates (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to retrieve the item that Blake wants.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R12).
   - This action is necessary to have the chocolates in Casey's possession.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) with the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary to bring the chocolates back to where Blake is.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R22).
   - This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want, which will make Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the chocolates, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
