The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the crossroads to the merchant. She attacks the merchant, killing her and taking the medicine. With the merchant dead, the bandit now has the medicine and can return to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may acquire later.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the merchant**: This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the merchant and take the medicine.
2. **The bandit attacks the merchant**: Since the merchant is not armed, the bandit can successfully kill her and take the medicine, which is part of her goal to carry as many coins or items as possible.

The story is short and direct, focusing solely on the bandit's actions to achieve her goal.
