To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given that Bubba is currently at the bank and wants to get money, he can take actions that will lead him to achieve his goal. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk:** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has the only money available.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
