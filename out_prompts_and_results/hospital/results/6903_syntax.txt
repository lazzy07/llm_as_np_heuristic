To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room and assess Young. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients receive the necessary care.

5. **Walk to Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room C to assess and treat Jones, ensuring that he also receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This completes the treatment for all patients.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the treatment.
2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: This action is necessary to evaluate Young's condition and ensure he receives treatment.
