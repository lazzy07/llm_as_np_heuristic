In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: Although this action does not directly affect Jones, it is necessary to ensure that Ross is not left unattended in the admissions room, which could lead to complications for him. 

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to identify Jones's symptoms, which is essential for determining the correct treatment.

2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to provide Jones with the necessary treatment based on the symptoms identified in the previous step, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**: This action is taken to move Ross to a more appropriate location, ensuring he is not left in the admissions room.

By following these actions, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
