To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the bank and is hungry. He decides to go to the forest where Bambi is located, as he might want to eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain food, which will help him satisfy his hunger.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action fulfills his hunger and allows him to regain energy.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba returns to the bank. He is still greedy and wants money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Back at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steals the money from him. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

The story is structured to ensure that Bubba's actions lead him to satisfy his hunger first and then achieve his greedy goal of acquiring money. Each action is necessary to progress towards the final outcome.
