To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in a location where she can interact with the Bandit, who is carrying coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, will rob the Bandit, taking the coins from her. This action is necessary for the Merchant to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as she is not attacking or killing anyone.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: After successfully robbing the Bandit, the Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads to be in a safer location and to avoid any potential confrontation with the Guard.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to continue her business and potentially find more opportunities to acquire coins.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity, as she only robs the Bandit who is a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary to position the Merchant in the Market where the Bandit is located.
- The second action allows the Merchant to acquire coins directly from the Bandit, fulfilling her goal.
- The third action is a strategic move to ensure the Merchant is not in the same location as the Bandit after the robbery, reducing the risk of retaliation.
- The fourth action allows the Merchant to return to her preferred location, the Market, to continue her business.
