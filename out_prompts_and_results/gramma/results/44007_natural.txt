To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a location where she can interact with other characters, particularly the guard and the hero.

2. **The merchant gives the hero's coin to the guard.**  
   - The merchant needs to give away the hero's coin to the guard to avoid being seen as a criminal. This action allows her to maintain her non-criminal status while still acquiring a coin.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to be at the crossroads to confront the bandit and ensure that the merchant is not implicated in any criminal activity.

4. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant.**  
   - This action helps the merchant understand the situation regarding the bandit and ensures that the guard is aware of the bandit's presence, which is crucial for the merchant's safety.

5. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant needs to return to the market to continue her business and potentially acquire more coins.

6. **The merchant buys a sword from the merchant (herself) using the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to acquire an item that can help her in future dealings, while also ensuring she has a coin in her possession.

By following these actions, the merchant successfully acquires a coin and a sword without engaging in any criminal activity.
