After walking to the Crossroads, Tom realizes he needs to get back to the cottage with the medicine he looted from the merchant. However, he knows that the bandit is also at the market and could pose a threat. To ensure his safety and achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, who is also at the market.

Tom takes the action to report the bandit’s location to the guard. This action is necessary because it alerts the guard to the presence of a criminal, which could lead to the bandit being dealt with, allowing Tom to safely return to the cottage with the medicine.

After reporting, Tom can then walk back to the cottage without fear of the bandit.

Here’s the complete action:

1. **report(Tom, Market, Market)** - Tom reports the bandit’s location to the guard, ensuring that the guard can take action against the bandit.

Now, Tom can safely walk back to the cottage with the medicine.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)** - Tom walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

The story is complete with these two actions, and Tom successfully reaches his goal.
