Ernest, currently in the locked gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to ensure his survival and secure the pack of cigarettes. He decides to take revenge on the bully by killing him with the knife he stole earlier. This action will eliminate the threat posed by the bully and allow him to keep the cigarettes, which he desires.

**Action:**
1. **revenge(Ernest, Bully, Gym)** - Ernest kills the bully with the knife.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Ernest's goal of not being threatened and allows him to keep the pack of cigarettes. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on his escape.

After killing the bully, Ernest can then put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier and escape through the highway, but since the goal is to achieve Ernest's immediate safety and possession of the cigarettes, the story ends here.

**Final Plan:**
