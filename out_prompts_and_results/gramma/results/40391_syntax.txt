To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coin that Tom was carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the bandit camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully robs the Merchant and then returns to the camp with the stolen coin, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without directly attacking or killing anyone, which would draw attention from the Guard.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit can store the coins in a safe location, thus achieving her goal.
