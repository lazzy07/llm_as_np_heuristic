**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, having completed his chores in the kitchen, decides to take a risk. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs to help Ernest, who is currently in the gym and threatened by the bully. 

1. **Action: Roy sneaks into the kitchen and takes the knife.**  
   - This action is necessary because Roy needs a weapon to protect himself and Ernest from the bully. 

2. **Action: Roy moves to the gym and locks the door behind him.**  
   - This action ensures that the bully cannot escape and that Roy can confront him without the risk of being interrupted. 

3. **Action: Roy kills the bully with the knife.**  
   - This action is crucial as it eliminates the threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing them both to be safe and achieve their goal of staying alive.

With the bully dead, Roy can now help Ernest without fear of being threatened. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of taking the knife is essential for self-defense and to protect Ernest. 
- Locking the gym door prevents the bully from escaping and allows Roy to confront him directly. 
- Killing the bully is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened, allowing them to survive.
