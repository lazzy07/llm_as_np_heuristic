To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) to be closer to Casey, who is in the same room.
2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the bathroom (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This action is essential as it transfers the jewelry from Blake to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
