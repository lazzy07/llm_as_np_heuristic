To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** This action directly gives Bubba the money he desires.

Here’s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has 1 money. Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and stealing is a direct way to achieve that.
   
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can successfully take the money from the clerk without any resistance.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.
