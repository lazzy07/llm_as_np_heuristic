To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage. This is necessary as the cottage is not directly accessible from the market.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom will walk to the cottage. This is the final step to reach his destination.

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way for Tom to end up at the cottage with the medicine he has purchased.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom leaves the market where he has just bought the medicine. He needs to get to the crossroads to access the path to the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom arrives at the crossroads and then walks directly to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

The actions taken are necessary to ensure Tom reaches his desired location without any unnecessary interactions or complications.
