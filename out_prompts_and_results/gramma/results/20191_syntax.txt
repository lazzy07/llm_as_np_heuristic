To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Market**: This action is necessary because Tom needs to reach the Merchant to obtain the medicine.
   
2. **Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant**: Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal, and since the Merchant is at the Market with the medicine, this action is essential.

3. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom needs to return to the Crossroads to head towards the cottage.

4. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage**: Finally, Tom walks to the cottage, completing his goal of being there with the medicine.

The Bandit and the Guard are present at the Market, but they do not interfere with Tom's actions since Tom is not a criminal and does not pose a threat to them. The Merchant is willing to sell the medicine to Tom, as she is not a criminal and wants to make a profit without breaking the law.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom needs to go to the Merchant to buy the medicine.
2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant.
3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom returns to the Crossroads after acquiring the medicine.
4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom finally walks to the cottage with the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal in the shortest possible way.
