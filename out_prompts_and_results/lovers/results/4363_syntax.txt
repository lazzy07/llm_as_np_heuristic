To achieve Blake's goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake needs to get the item that Alex wants (I1 - jewelry) to make Alex happy.** 
2. **Blake also needs to ensure that they themselves are happy, which means they need to get the item they want (I2 - chocolates).**

Given the current situation, we can see that:
- Alex (C1) wants I1 (jewelry) and is currently unhappy.
- Casey (C3) has I1 (jewelry) and wants I3 (flowers).
- Blake (C2) is currently unhappy and wants I2 (chocolates).

To achieve the goal, Blake can take the following actions:

1. **Trade I1 (jewelry) with Casey for I2 (chocolates).** This will make Blake happy because they will have the chocolates they want, and it will also make Alex happy because they will receive the jewelry they want.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)** - Blake trades chocolates (I2) with Casey for jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want while also giving Alex the item they want.

After this action:
- Blake is happy because they have I2 (chocolates).
- Alex is happy because they have I1 (jewelry).
- Casey is unhappy because they have given away I1 (jewelry) but still has I3 (flowers).

Now, Blake has achieved their goal of being happy, and Alex is also happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
