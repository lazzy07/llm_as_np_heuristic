To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will reflect the characters' goals of safety and friendship, while also leading to the inevitable eruption of the volcano.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both Zoe and the Lizard. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption and the subsequent consequences.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to seek shelter from the eruption. This action shows her desire to be safe and healthy, as she is trying to avoid the danger of the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard also walks to the cave, following Zoe. This action indicates that the Lizard is also seeking safety and is willing to be near Zoe, which is a step towards friendship.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt and results in the death of any character that remains on the surface.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard make peace with each other. This action solidifies their friendship, showing that despite the danger outside, they have found common ground and a desire to be friends.

In summary, the story progresses through actions that lead to the eruption of the volcano while also allowing for the characters to become friends. The characters' actions reflect their goals of safety and friendship, culminating in the eruption that results in the death of Zoe, as she was on the surface when the volcano erupted.
