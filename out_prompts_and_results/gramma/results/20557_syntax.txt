To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has just purchased from the Merchant. This action is possible because the Bandit is armed and Tom is not. This will allow the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then moves to the camp, where she can store her coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without risking her status as a criminal, since Tom is not armed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit can secure her coins in the chest, which is part of her goal.
