To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to the item they want (jewelry).
2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey follows Alex to the dining room, as they want to be near Alex.
3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake also moves to the dining room to stay with Alex and Casey.
4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for the item they want.
5. **put_down(C3, I3, R12)**: Blake puts down the flowers (I3) in the dining room, as they are not relevant to Alex's goal.
6. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) with the jewelry, ensuring they have the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Moving to the dining room** allows all characters to be in the same location, facilitating interaction.
- **Giving the jewelry** is the crucial action that directly fulfills Alex's goal of happiness.
- **Putting down the flowers** is a minor action that does not affect the main goal but shows Blake's willingness to prioritize Alex's happiness.
- **Moving back to the living room** is a final action to signify that Alex has achieved their goal and is now happy.
