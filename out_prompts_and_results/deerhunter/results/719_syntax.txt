To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Bubba enters the bank with a loaded rifle, driven by greed and hunger. He sees the bank clerk, who has money. 
- In a moment of desperation and greed, Bubba shoots the clerk, ensuring that he can take the money without any resistance.
- With the clerk incapacitated, Bubba picks up the money, achieving his goal.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
