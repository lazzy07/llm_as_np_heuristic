Bubba is determined to get money, and since he is currently at the bank, he can take direct action to achieve his goal. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**

At the end of these actions, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted, fulfilling his goal.
