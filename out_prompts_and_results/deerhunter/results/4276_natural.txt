To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is hungry and wants to eat, he will first need to ensure he has the money to satisfy his hunger. The clerk has 1 money, which Bubba desires. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to hand over the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Decide to steal:** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to obtain money, and the only way to do that without any other means is to threaten the clerk.
- **Steal the money:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, and the story will conclude with him achieving his goal.
