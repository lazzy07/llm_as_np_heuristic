To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the living room. This is important for Alex to share their happiness with Casey.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it not only makes Alex happy by obtaining the flowers but also helps Casey feel happy as they receive a gift.

5. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey. This is necessary for Blake to be part of the happy moment.

6. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I3) to Blake. This action helps Blake achieve their happiness, as they also want to be happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Casey is happy because they received the flowers, and Blake is happy because they received the chocolates.
