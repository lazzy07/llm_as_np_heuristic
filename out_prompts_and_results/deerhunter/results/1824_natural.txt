To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk, but he needs to be at the bank to do that. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to steal the money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, which will allow him to take the money without any resistance.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Going to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be in the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
2. **Shooting the clerk** is a direct action that allows Bubba to eliminate the threat and take the money.
3. **Picking up the money** is the final action that ensures Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions leads to the conclusion that Bubba has the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
