**Story Completion:**

Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to protect himself and his friend Ernest. He takes a deep breath, grips the knife tightly, and confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he lunges forward and kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now focus on escaping. He unlocks the gym door and rushes back to the hallway. There, he puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he sneaks out through the hallway and crawls through the vent to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
