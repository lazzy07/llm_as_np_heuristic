To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then walk to the admissions room and assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and decide on the correct treatment.
2. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and decide on the correct treatment.
3. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
4. **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
