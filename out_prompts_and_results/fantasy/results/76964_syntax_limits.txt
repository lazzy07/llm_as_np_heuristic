After the events that have transpired, Rory is in the cave, and Talia is in the village with the money. To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, he needs to acquire the treasure from the cave and ensure he has enough resources to satisfy his hunger.

1. **Travel from Cave to Village**: Rory travels back to the village to meet Talia. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Talia to interact with her and potentially gain access to the money she has.

2. **Take the Money from Talia**: Once Rory is in the village, he takes the money from Talia. This action is crucial as it allows Rory to become wealthy, which is one of his primary goals.

With these two actions, Rory successfully achieves his goal of being happy (due to his relationship with Talia), wealthy (by acquiring the money), and not hungry (as he can now afford food).
