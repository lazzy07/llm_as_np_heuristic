To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already at the bank and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use this to intimidate the bank clerk into giving him the money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and ensure he can take the money without resistance. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money without facing opposition.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is not strictly necessary for acquiring money but serves to fulfill Bubba's hunger and greed, as he has already eaten Bambi.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any risk.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger and greed, as he has already consumed Bambi.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Acquires the money, fulfilling Bubba's goal.
