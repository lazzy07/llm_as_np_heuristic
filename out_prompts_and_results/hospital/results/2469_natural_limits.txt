Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit the remaining patients in the admissions room to the available exam room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is in Patient Room B.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.)
