To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey (C3) tells Alex (C1) that they want the chocolates (I2)** in the living room (R22). This is a strategic lie to redirect Alex's focus, as Casey knows Alex has the jewelry (I1) that they actually want. 
   - **Action:** `tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)`

2. **Alex (C1) moves to the living room (R22)** to talk to Casey and understand their needs better.
   - **Action:** `move(C1, R22, R22)`

3. **Blake (C2) picks up the jewelry (I1)** from Alex (C1) since they are in the same room (R22).
   - **Action:** `pick_up(C2, I1, R22)`

4. **Blake (C2) gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3)** in the living room (R22). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry.
   - **Action:** `give(C2, I1, C3, R22)`

5. **Casey (C3) is now happy** because they have received the jewelry (I3) they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is a strategic lie by Casey to redirect Alex's attention, ensuring that Alex does not realize that Casey actually wants the jewelry.
- The second action is simply moving Alex to the same room to facilitate communication.
- The third action allows Blake to pick up the jewelry, which is essential for fulfilling Casey's goal.
- The fourth action is the crucial step where Blake gives the jewelry to Casey, making Casey happy.
