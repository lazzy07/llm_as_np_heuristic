To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at her camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored safely, which is part of her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action (robbing Tom) is crucial because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without needing to engage in a more dangerous confrontation with the Guard or Merchant.
- The second action (walking to the Bandit Camp) is necessary for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- The third action (taking coins from the chest) is the final step to ensure that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in her possession.
