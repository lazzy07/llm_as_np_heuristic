To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Given the current situation, Alex is in the dining room (R22) and the flowers are also in the dining room. 

The simplest action for Alex to take is to pick up the flowers. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, thus making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, the state changes as follows:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex is now happy because they have the flowers).

The final plan in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, achieving Alex's goal with the minimum necessary action.
