To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. If he has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Young. This is important because Young is also a patient who needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both patients effectively, achieving the goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
