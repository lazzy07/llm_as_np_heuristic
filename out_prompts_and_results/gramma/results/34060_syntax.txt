To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location.

The story is very straightforward because Tom already has the medicine and just needs to get to the cottage. There are no other characters that can interfere with his goal at this point since the Merchant is dead, the Guard is at the Market, and the Bandit is also at the Crossroads but does not pose a threat to Tom since he is armed and can simply walk away.

Here’s the complete story:

1. Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, successfully reaching his destination while carrying the medicine.

This single action is sufficient for Tom to achieve his goal.
