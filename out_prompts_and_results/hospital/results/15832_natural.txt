**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, noticing that Young is experiencing a fever, decides to treat Young for Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the urgency of treating Young outweighs this risk. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** 
   - This action is necessary because Young has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. Treating Young correctly will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 2. Young is now healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are still in the admissions room and experiencing unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat him.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is also necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

Now, Dr. Hathaway can assess both patients.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which are also currently unknown.

Assuming that both patients show symptoms of their respective diseases (Jones has a rash indicating Jarkis, and Ross has a fever indicating Flaze), Dr. Hathaway can now treat them.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**
   - This action is necessary because Jones has a rash, which is a symptom of Jarkis. Treating him correctly will ensure that he becomes healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**
   - This action is necessary because Ross has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. Treating him correctly will ensure that he becomes healthy.

At this point, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients based on their symptoms. The sequence ensures that all patients are treated correctly and efficiently, leading to their recovery.
