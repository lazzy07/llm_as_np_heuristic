To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is in an unknown location, but we know that I1 (the flowers) is with Casey (C3) and I3 (the chocolates) is in the living room (R22). 

Since Blake (C2) wants Alex (C1) to be happy and Alex wants the chocolates (I3), Blake can help Alex first, which will also help Blake achieve their goal indirectly. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Blake tells Alex that Casey has the jewelry (I2)** in the living room (R22). This is a lie, but it will motivate Alex to act.
   - **Action**: `tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)`

2. **Alex moves to the living room (R22)** to check on Casey and the jewelry.
   - **Action**: `move(C1, R12, R22)`

3. **Blake picks up the chocolates (I3)** from the living room (R22).
   - **Action**: `pick_up(C2, I3, R22)`

4. **Blake gives the chocolates (I3)** to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22).
   - **Action**: `give(C2, I3, C1, R22)`

5. **Now that Alex has the chocolates (I3), they are happy**. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, Blake is also happy now.
   - **Action**: No further action needed as Blake's goal is achieved.

In this sequence, Blake successfully helps Alex achieve happiness by giving them the chocolates, which in turn makes Blake happy as well. The lie about the jewelry serves to motivate Alex to move and act, allowing Blake to pick up the chocolates and give them to Alex.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)",
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "pick_up(C2, I3, R22)",
    "give(C2, I3, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by facilitating Alex's happiness through the chocolates.
