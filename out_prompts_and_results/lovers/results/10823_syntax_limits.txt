In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R12), while Casey (C3) is in the bathroom (R22) with the jewelry. 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action is necessary:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the bathroom to reach Casey, who has the jewelry.

After this action, Alex will be in the same room as Casey, and since Casey wants to make Blake happy and has the jewelry that Alex desires, Casey will likely be willing to give it to Alex.

Now, let's summarize the action taken:

- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: This action is essential because it allows Alex to reach Casey, who has the item Alex wants. 

After this action, Alex can then receive the jewelry from Casey, achieving their goal of happiness.
