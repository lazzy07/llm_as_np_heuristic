Ernest, realizing he is locked in the gym with the bully, decides to take action to ensure his survival. He knows he has the knife, which gives him a chance to defend himself. 

**Action:** Ernest kills the bully with the knife.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, who has already threatened both him and Roy. By killing the bully, Ernest ensures that he and Roy are no longer in danger, allowing him to focus on his goal of staying alive and potentially finding a way to get cigarettes later.

After killing the bully, Ernest can then escape from the gym, but since the story only requires one action to achieve the goal, we conclude here.
