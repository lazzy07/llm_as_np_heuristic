In this story, Zoe is currently on her spaceship, while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve this, Zoe will teleport from the spaceship to the surface of the planet, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to approach the Lizard and attempt to establish a friendship. However, since the surface is currently dangerous due to the erupting volcano, Zoe must act quickly.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is essential for her to interact with the Lizard and work towards making friends.

Once Zoe arrives on the surface, she will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe while fostering friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is necessary to improve their relationship and ensure that they can work together to navigate the dangerous situation caused by the erupting volcano.

However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts, which is a critical event that will lead to one of the characters dying. Since the surface is uninhabitable, Zoe will not survive the eruption.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death. This action concludes the story with the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

In summary, the actions taken are necessary for Zoe to attempt to make friends with the Lizard while also facing the imminent danger of the erupting volcano. The story ends with Zoe's death due to the eruption, but the attempt to make peace signifies a step towards friendship, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.
