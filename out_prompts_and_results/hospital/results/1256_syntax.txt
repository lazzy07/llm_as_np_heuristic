To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has a symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway can admit Jones to an exam room. This action is necessary to start the treatment process for Jones.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Ross's current symptom is unknown to Hathaway, and assessing him will help Hathaway decide on the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. Since Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, this treatment will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Young is currently in the admissions room and has a different symptom (SymptomB). Admitting Young will allow Hathaway to treat him later.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis (the disease associated with SymptomB). This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, both Ross and Young will achieve their goals of being alive and healthy.
