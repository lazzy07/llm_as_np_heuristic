In the living room, Alex, holding the flowers, sees that Blake is unhappy because he wants the chocolates, and Casey is unhappy because she wants the jewelry. To help Blake and Casey, Alex decides to give the flowers to Casey, knowing that this will make her happy. 

**Action: Alex gives flowers to Casey.** 

This action is included because it allows Alex to achieve their goal of making Casey happy, while also fostering goodwill among the characters. Although it doesn't directly make Alex happy, it aligns with their desire for Casey's happiness, which is a part of their overall goal.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is no longer holding the flowers.
- Casey is now happy because she has the flowers.
- Blake is still unhappy because he still wants the chocolates.
- Alex is still happy because they achieved their goal of making Casey happy.
