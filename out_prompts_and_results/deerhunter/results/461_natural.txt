To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the ability to shoot. Bambi is also in the forest, which makes it possible for Bubba to shoot Bambi and potentially eat her, satisfying his hunger.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and shooting Bambi will allow him to eat, which is one of his goals.
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat her, satisfying his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of eating, and Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still does not have any money. To achieve the goal of Bubba having money, we can add the following actions:

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located.
5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having money.

Now, we have both conditions satisfied: Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba's hunger drives him to consider shooting Bambi.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead and allows Bubba to eat.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
- **Go from the forest to the bank:** Necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and steal the money.
- **Steal the money from the clerk:** Achieves the goal of Bubba having money.
