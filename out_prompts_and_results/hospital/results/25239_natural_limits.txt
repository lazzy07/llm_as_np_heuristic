Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room B with Jones. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a chance of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to understand Jones's condition.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - After assessing, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the assessment. If Hathaway misdiagnoses Jones due to the high workload, it could lead to a negative outcome. However, treating Jones is crucial for his health.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess and treat Young.**  
   - After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to ensure Young is also healthy. Walking to Patient Room C allows Hathaway to assess and treat Young, fulfilling the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

In this scenario, the story is kept concise while ensuring that Dr. Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy is achieved.
