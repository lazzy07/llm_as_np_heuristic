To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to give away.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2) in the bathroom (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves from the bathroom (R12) to the living room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's goal but helps to position Blake in a different room after receiving the item.

4. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the bathroom (R12). This action is included to allow Alex to check on Casey and Blake after they have exchanged items.

5. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bathroom (R12) to the dining room (R22). This action is included to allow Alex to be in the same room as Casey and Blake after the exchange.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry (I2), making Blake happy. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "give(C3, I2, C2, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R12)",
    "move(C1, R12, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the bathroom to give the jewelry to Blake.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: This is the key action that makes Blake happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to a different room after receiving the jewelry, which is a natural progression.
- **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex checks on the situation after the exchange, ensuring they are involved in the story.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room, maintaining the flow of the story and keeping all characters engaged. 

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
