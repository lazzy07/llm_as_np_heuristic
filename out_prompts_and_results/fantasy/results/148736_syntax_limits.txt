In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. The current situation shows that Rory is already happy due to his marriage to Talia. However, he is not wealthy, as he has no treasure or money, and he is not hungry. To achieve his goal, Rory needs to acquire wealth.

Since Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located, Rory can travel to the cave to join her. Once there, he can pick up the treasure, which will make him wealthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels from the village to the cave to be with Talia and to access the treasure.
2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, achieving his goal of becoming wealthy.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy while maintaining his happiness.
