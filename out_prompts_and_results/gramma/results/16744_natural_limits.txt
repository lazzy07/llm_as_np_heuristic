The bandit, having just robbed the hero of their coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is at the market and the merchant is dead, leaving her free to act without immediate threat. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the hero's coin in the chest. 

This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. By moving to the bandit camp, she secures her loot without the risk of being confronted by the guard.
