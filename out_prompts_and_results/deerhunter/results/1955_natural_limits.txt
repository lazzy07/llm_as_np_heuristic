Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, spots Bambi in the forest. He decides to shoot Bambi with the rifle he has loaded with ammunition. This action serves two purposes: it satisfies Bubba's hunger by allowing him to eat Bambi, and it also results in Bambi being dead, which fulfills the requirement of the story.

After shooting Bambi, Bubba can then decide to eat the deer, which will satisfy his hunger. However, since the goal is to end with Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead or both, the first action of shooting Bambi is sufficient to meet the criteria.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: This action results in Bambi being dead, which is one of the required outcomes of the story.
2. **(Optional) Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: This action would satisfy Bubba's hunger, but it is not necessary to achieve the ending since Bambi being dead is already sufficient.
