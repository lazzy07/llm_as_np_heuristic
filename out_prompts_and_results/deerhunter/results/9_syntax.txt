To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, he will need to go to the bank where the clerk is located. Since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he will use the rifle and ammunition he picked up to intimidate the bank clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba leaves the house where he picked up the rifle and ammunition and heads to the bank to confront the clerk. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Once at the bank, Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is crucial because it prepares him to threaten the clerk, ensuring he has the means to enforce his demands.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk. This action is taken to eliminate any resistance and ensure he can take the money without opposition.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go**: To reach the bank where the money is located.
- **load**: To prepare the rifle for intimidation or defense.
- **shoot**: To remove the threat posed by the clerk and secure the money.
