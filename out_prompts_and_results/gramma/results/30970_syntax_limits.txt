In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp with a sword, and Tom is at the Crossroads with the Medicine. The Bandit is at the Cottage, and the Guard is at the Market.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Merchant can rob Tom, who is unarmed and carrying the Medicine. This action allows the Merchant to take the Medicine from Tom, which she can then sell for coins later.
