Ernest is on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes, and has the pack of cigarettes. He knows that Roy is still in the cell block and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to achieve his goal of being alive and having a pack of cigarettes, Ernest decides to escape from the prison.

**Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)**

This action is taken because it allows Ernest to leave the prison safely while he is disguised, ensuring he is no longer threatened by the bully or the prison environment. By escaping, he achieves his goal of being alive and having the pack of cigarettes, as he can keep them with him outside the prison.

**Final Plan:**
