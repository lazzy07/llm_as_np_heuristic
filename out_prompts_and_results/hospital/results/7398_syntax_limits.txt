**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is currently unassigned and has an unknown symptom. This action is necessary to determine if Young has either Flaze or Jarkis, as Hathaway needs to ensure all patients are healthy.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway admits them to Exam Room B. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to treat Young based on the assessment results.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (which presents as a rash), Hathaway treats them with steroids. This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's condition, which is critical for providing the correct treatment.
- **Admit Young**: Admitting Young to an exam room is required to facilitate treatment. Without this step, Hathaway cannot provide care.
- **Treat Young**: This action is the culmination of Hathaway's efforts to ensure all patients are healthy. By treating Young correctly, Hathaway achieves their goal.
