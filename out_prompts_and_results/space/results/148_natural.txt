1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate threat of eruption.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard, demonstrating her commitment to their friendship and her desire to ensure the Lizard's safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They move to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps both characters achieve their goal of being healthy and safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave until the eruption is over.** - This action is implied as they wait for the danger to pass, ensuring both characters remain healthy and safe.
