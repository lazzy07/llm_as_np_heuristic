To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the guard is located, allowing her to potentially steal coins or loot from the guard.

2. **The bandit attacks the guard.**  
   - The bandit is armed and can attack the guard, who is not armed. This action is crucial for the bandit to eliminate the guard and take his sword and any coins he may have.

3. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.**  
   - After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit can loot his corpse to take any coins he has. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying more coins.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - With the coins now in her possession, the bandit walks back to her camp to secure the coins in her chest, ensuring her goal is achieved.

5. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully stored the coins, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the guard, who is a potential threat to her goal. By attacking the guard, she eliminates a risk and gains access to more resources (coins). Looting the guard's corpse allows her to collect the coins she needs. Finally, returning to the bandit camp and placing the coins in the chest secures her success.
