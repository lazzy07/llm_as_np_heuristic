The bandit, having just looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is at the market and that the hero is at the crossroads, unaware of her criminal actions. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the medicine and any coins she may acquire later.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp: This action allows the bandit to secure her loot (the medicine) in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. 

This is the shortest story where the bandit achieves her goal.
