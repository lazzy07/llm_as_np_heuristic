In the current situation, Blake (C3) is already happy because they have the item they want (I3). However, to ensure that Alex (C1) also becomes happy, Blake needs to help Alex get the item they want (I1). 

Since Alex wants I1 and believes that Casey (C2) has it, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Give (Blake gives I3 to Alex)**: Blake can give the jewelry (I3) they have to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action will make Alex happy because they will receive the item they want (I1).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have I1.
- Casey will still be unhappy because they do not have I2.
- Blake will still be happy because they have given away I3 but have achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

The action is necessary because it directly leads to Alex's happiness, which is Blake's goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["give(C3, I3, C1, R22)"]
