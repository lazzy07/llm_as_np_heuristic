To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to return to her preferred location, where she can engage in trade and potentially acquire more coins.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard is moving to the crossroads to investigate the situation, which may lead to the merchant being able to sell more items or trade without the threat of criminal activity.

3. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit is moving towards the crossroads, where she may encounter the merchant and the guard. This action is necessary to create a situation where the merchant can take advantage of the bandit's presence.

4. **The merchant buys the hero's coin from the bandit.**  
   - The bandit, who has the coin in her possession, can sell it to the merchant. This action allows the merchant to acquire a coin without engaging in criminal activity.

5. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant returns to the market with the newly acquired coin, solidifying her position and allowing her to continue her trade.
