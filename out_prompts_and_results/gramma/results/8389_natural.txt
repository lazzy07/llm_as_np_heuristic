The bandit, having just looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. The guard, who is armed and present at the market, poses a threat to the bandit. To ensure her safety and maximize her coin collection, the bandit needs to act quickly.

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to create distance from the guard, who may want to retaliate against her for her criminal actions.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action takes the bandit to her safe haven, where she can store her loot and avoid any confrontation with the guard.

3. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action secures the medicine, ensuring that it is safe and that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having valuable items in her camp.

At this point, the bandit has successfully moved to her camp with the medicine, fulfilling her goal of having valuable items secured.
