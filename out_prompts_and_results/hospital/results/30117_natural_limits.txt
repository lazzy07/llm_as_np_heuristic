Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, decides to assess Young, who is also in Patient Room B. This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates that Young has Jarkis. This assessment is crucial as it allows Hathaway to identify the correct disease and treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: After identifying the rash as a symptom of Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action ensures that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

With these two actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, and since both Ross and Jones are still in the admissions room and have not been assessed or treated, they remain alive and healthy as well.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's condition and ensure the correct treatment is administered.
- **Treat Young**: This action is essential to cure Young of Jarkis, thereby achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
