In this story, Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous for the Lizard. Zoe has made peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship, but the Lizard is still in a perilous situation.

To complete the story, Zoe will teleport to the surface to help the Lizard, but the volcano will erupt before she can ensure the Lizard's safety. This will lead to the Lizard's demise, but their friendship will remain intact as they shared a moment of connection before the disaster.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface to assist the Lizard, demonstrating her desire to help and make friends.
2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, which fulfills the condition of a character dying.

The actions are necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, and the Lizard dies, while also highlighting the friendship that was formed between Zoe and the Lizard.
