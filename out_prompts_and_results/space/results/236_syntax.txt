To complete the story, Zoe needs to make friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy. The current situation indicates that Zoe is in the cave, while the Lizard is on the surface, and the surface is dangerous due to the volcano beginning to erupt. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that Zoe will take to achieve her goal:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the cave. This action is taken to ensure that both characters can remain safe from the erupting volcano, as the surface is now dangerous.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship from the surface. This action ensures her safety and allows her to monitor the situation from a safe distance.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully makes friends with the Lizard and ensures both characters remain healthy and safe.
