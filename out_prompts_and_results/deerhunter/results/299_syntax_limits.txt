Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, decides to hunt for food in the forest. He spots Bambi, the deer, and aims his rifle at her. Since he has loaded ammunition, he can shoot her. After successfully shooting Bambi, he eats her to satisfy his hunger. With Bambi dead, he can now take her money, which he believes is with the bank clerk.

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)** - Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition to prepare for hunting.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)** - Bubba shoots Bambi, fulfilling his goal of hunting for food.
3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of eating, and Bambi is dead.

```json

  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
```
