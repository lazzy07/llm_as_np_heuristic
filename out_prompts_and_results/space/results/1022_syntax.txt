To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship for safety.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is taken to solidify their friendship. Since they are not fighting, this action will help them become friends, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe can safely teleport back to the spaceship. This action is necessary for her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **make_peace**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.
- **teleport_to_ship**: Ensures Zoe's safety by moving her away from the dangerous surface.

With these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
