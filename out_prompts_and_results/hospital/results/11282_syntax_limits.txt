**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, as knowing the correct diagnosis is crucial for treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess and admit Young, who is still waiting. This action is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients receive the care they need.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Jones** is the first step to determine his condition accurately. Since Hathaway's workload is at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if he assesses another patient without first treating one.
- **Treating Jones** with the correct treatment (antibiotics) ensures that he recovers from his illness, which is a direct step towards Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
- **Walking to Admissions** allows Hathaway to continue his work and ensure that Young is also assessed and treated, which is necessary for the overall health of all patients.
