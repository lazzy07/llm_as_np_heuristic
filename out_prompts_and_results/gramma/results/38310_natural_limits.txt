The bandit, armed with her sword and holding the medicine she looted from the merchant, decides to take action to secure her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She knows that the guard is a threat to her plans, so she quickly walks from the market to the crossroads, where she can hide the medicine and prepare for her next move.

At the crossroads, the bandit finds a safe spot to stash the medicine in a hidden location. This way, she can return to the bandit camp without being pursued by the guard, who is still at the market. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins and the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Walk from the market to the crossroads**: The bandit needs to create distance from the guard and find a safe place to hide the medicine.
2. **Hide the medicine at the crossroads**: This action ensures that the bandit has the medicine secured and can return to the bandit camp without the risk of losing it to the guard.
3. **Walk from the crossroads to the bandit camp**: This final action allows the bandit to return to her base, where she can safely keep her coins and the medicine.

By taking these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying the medicine and securing her coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
