To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads to meet Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads with the Medicine and has a coin. This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be in the same location as Tom to conduct any transactions.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys the coin from Tom using the coin she has. This action allows the Merchant to gain an additional coin without committing any crimes, thus achieving her goal of acquiring more coins.

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way for the Merchant to achieve her goal without engaging in criminal activity.
