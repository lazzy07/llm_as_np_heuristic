To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the fact that Talia has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince. Since she is already in a relationship with both, we can have her marry one of them, which will make her happy.

Here's the action that will complete the story:

1. marry(Talia, Rory, Village)

**Explanation of the action:**
- By marrying Rory, Talia will achieve happiness, as marriage is a significant event that fulfills her desire for happiness. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her primary goals.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["marry(Talia, Rory, Village)"]
}
``` 

This single action effectively concludes the story by ensuring Talia becomes happy through marriage.
