To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment Jones needs.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomB (which is assumed to be Flaze). This will make Young healthy.

5. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: After assessing Jones and determining his symptoms, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of making them healthy.
