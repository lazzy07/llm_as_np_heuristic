To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake is currently in the living room (R21) and wants to be happy.** Blake's happiness is contingent on having the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). 
2. **Casey is in the dining room (R22) and has the jewelry (I3), which they want.** Casey is currently happy because they have the item they want.
3. **Alex is also in the dining room (R22) and has the flowers (I1), which they want.** Alex is currently happy as well.

Since Blake is in the living room and wants the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R22), Blake needs to move to the dining room to pick up the chocolates. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room to the dining room to get the chocolates.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room.
3. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake puts down the chocolates in the living room, achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and they also want Alex to be happy, which they are. 

The actions are necessary to ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
