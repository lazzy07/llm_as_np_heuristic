The Hero, despite having stolen the money initially, is now at the mercy of the Villain, who has effectively achieved their goal of controlling the President.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The Villain has already bribed the President with the money, which is the only action needed to achieve their goal of control. The Hero's fear of the Villain prevents them from intervening, ensuring the Villain's success.
