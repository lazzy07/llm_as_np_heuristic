The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and looted the hero's coin, sees the guard at the market. The bandit knows that the guard is a threat to her freedom and her goal of accumulating coins. To achieve her goal, the bandit decides to take action against the guard.

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the guard to ensure her safety and to continue her criminal activities without being pursued.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's sword.** After successfully attacking and killing the guard, the bandit can now take the guard's sword, which will further protect her and allow her to defend herself against any future threats.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** With the guard dead and her new sword in hand, the bandit can safely return to her camp, where she can store her coins and feel secure.

4. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she now has the hero's coin safely stored in her chest.

The bandit has now accomplished her goal of accumulating coins without being caught by the guard.
