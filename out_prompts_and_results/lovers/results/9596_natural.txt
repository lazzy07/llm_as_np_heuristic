To achieve Blake's goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to leave the bathroom to access the living room where the jewelry is located. Casey believes the jewelry is with Blake, and by moving to the living room, Casey can potentially interact with Blake.

2. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, which they believe is what they want. Although Casey actually wants the jewelry, this action is crucial for the next step.

3. **Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Blake needs to move to the bathroom to interact with Casey, who now has the jewelry. Blake believes that the chocolates are in the bathroom, so this movement aligns with Blake's goal.

4. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom.**  
   - This action is a lie, as Blake does not know where the chocolates are. However, it is a strategic move to get Casey to give up the jewelry.

5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.**  
   - Casey, believing Blake's lie, gives the jewelry to Blake, thinking it will help Blake find the chocolates.

6. **Blake puts down the jewelry in the bathroom.**  
   - Blake puts down the jewelry to create a distraction and to keep Casey from wanting it back.

7. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.**  
   - Finally, Blake picks up the chocolates, achieving their goal of being happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to manipulate the beliefs and desires of the characters to achieve Blake's goal. The movement between rooms allows for interaction, while the lies and trades create a scenario where Blake can ultimately obtain the chocolates.
