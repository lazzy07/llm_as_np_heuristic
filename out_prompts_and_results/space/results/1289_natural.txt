Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and health.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is taken because Zoe needs to ensure her safety by getting to the spaceship, which is a safe location. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends, and Zoe's priority is her safety.

2. **Zoe uses the spaceship's communication system to send a message to the Lizard.** This action is necessary to maintain their friendship and ensure the Lizard knows Zoe is safe. It also allows Zoe to express her concern for the Lizard's safety.

3. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** This action is taken by the Lizard to find a safe place away from the erupting volcano. The cave is a safer location for the Lizard, ensuring its health and safety.

4. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** This action is taken to reunite with the Lizard in a safe location. Since they are friends, Zoe wants to ensure they can continue to support each other.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they both feel safe and healthy together in the cave.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
