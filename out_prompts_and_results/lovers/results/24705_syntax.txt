To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Action: move(C2, R22, R21)** - Blake (C2) moves to the dining room (R21) where Casey (C3) is currently located. This is necessary because Blake needs to interact with Casey to help them both achieve happiness.

2. **Action: tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)** - Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move because it can influence Casey's actions and help Blake achieve their goal indirectly.

3. **Action: move(C3, R21, R22)** - Casey moves to the living room (R22) where Alex (C1) is located. This is necessary for Casey to potentially get the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3).

4. **Action: give(C3, I2, C1, R22)** - Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1). This action is important because it helps Casey to feel happy by giving Alex something they want, which is the chocolates.

5. **Action: trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)** - Alex trades the flowers (I1) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey wants. This is crucial because it allows both Alex and Casey to achieve happiness.

6. **Action: give(C1, I3, C2, R22)** - Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2). This final action ensures that Blake is happy because they now have the item they wanted.

By following this sequence of actions, Blake achieves their goal of happiness while also ensuring that Alex is happy with the chocolates and Casey is happy with the jewelry.
