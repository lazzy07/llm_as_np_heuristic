To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will lead to this outcome while adhering to the constraints provided.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano has already begun to erupt, which sets the stage for the impending danger on the surface. This action is necessary to create a sense of urgency and danger.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave to seek shelter from the eruption. This action is taken to avoid the immediate danger of the volcano while also moving closer to the Lizard, which is essential for their friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is taken to ensure that both characters are in the same location, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once both characters are in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard take the opportunity to make peace with each other. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of their goals.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying, as the eruption will have consequences for the characters on the surface.

In this sequence, Zoe and the Lizard successfully make peace and become friends while the volcano erupts, leading to the death of one of them. Since Zoe is in the cave and the Lizard is on the surface, the Lizard will die in the eruption.
