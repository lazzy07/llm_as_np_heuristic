Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with other creatures. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, creating an immediate threat to both Zoe and the Lizard. This action is necessary to escalate the urgency of their situation and prompt them to seek safety together.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is the guardian. This action is taken to find a safe place away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is necessary for both characters to stay together and ensure their safety.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship. This action solidifies their bond and ensures that they are no longer in conflict, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of making friends.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts fully, but since both characters are now safely in the cave, they are unharmed. This action concludes the immediate danger on the surface and highlights the success of their cooperation.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
