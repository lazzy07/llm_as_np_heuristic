**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment, and Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in the admissions room. Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway, now with a workload of 2, correctly identifies that Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, making him healthy as well.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and Jones, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
