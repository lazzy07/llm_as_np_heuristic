In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and wants to be wealthy. The quickest way for Gargax to achieve this goal is to eat a human who possesses money. Since Vince is at the Village with the money, Gargax will travel to the Village and eat Vince to take the money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels from the Cave to the Village to reach Vince, who has the money.
2. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax eats Vince, which allows Gargax to take the money that Vince had.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring the money) and will no longer be hungry (since they have eaten Vince).
