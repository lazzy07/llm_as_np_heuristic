To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is already in the bank and has stolen the rifle from the clerk. Since Bubba is greedy and hungry, he will take actions that align with his desire for money while also considering his hunger.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank who could potentially stop Bubba from achieving his goal of acquiring money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a way to utilize the situation to his advantage, as he is hungry.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to take the money from the clerk's body. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Shooting the clerk** is crucial for Bubba to remove any obstacles in his way to obtaining money.
- **Eating the clerk** addresses Bubba's hunger, ensuring he is not left vulnerable after committing the act.
- **Deciding to get the money** is the final step in achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.
