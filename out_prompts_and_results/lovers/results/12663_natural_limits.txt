In the living room, Casey, who currently has the jewelry, wants to be happy by keeping the jewelry. Blake, who is not happy, wants the chocolates, which are in the dining room. Alex is happy with the flowers but is unaware of Blake's desire for the chocolates. 

To achieve their goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Casey gives jewelry to Blake.** This action is necessary because it allows Casey to make Blake happy by giving him the item he wants, which is the jewelry. In return, Blake will feel happy, and since Casey already has the jewelry, this action fulfills Casey's goal of being happy with the jewelry.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy with the flowers.
- Blake is happy with the jewelry.
- Casey is happy with the jewelry.

Thus, Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
