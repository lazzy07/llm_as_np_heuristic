In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where Tom, the Merchant, and the Guard are also present. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit can rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying the Merchant's coin. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin from Tom, increasing her total coins.

This action is necessary because it directly helps the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins. Since the Bandit is armed and Tom is not, the robbery is successful.

After this action, the Bandit will have the coin, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible story that allows the Bandit to achieve her goal with just one action.
