To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit needs to leave the cottage to allow Tom to safely return with the medicine. 

2. **The hero walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - Tom needs to go to the market to retrieve the medicine from the merchant.

3. **The hero buys the medicine from the merchant using the hero's coin.**  
   - This action is essential for Tom to obtain the medicine, which is his goal.

4. **The hero walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom returns to the cottage with the medicine in hand.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully ends up at the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.
