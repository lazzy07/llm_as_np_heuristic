In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. 

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk Ross from the Admissions room to Exam Room A. This action is not strictly necessary for Jones's immediate goal but is included to ensure that Ross is also attended to, as he is a patient in the hospital.

Now, let's outline the story with the actions taken:

1. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms.
2. Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment, ensuring he receives the correct treatment for his condition.
3. Hathaway walks Ross to Exam Room A to ensure he is also seen by the doctor.

By following these actions, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Jones is treated correctly and achieves his goal of being healthy while also considering the care of another patient, Ross.
