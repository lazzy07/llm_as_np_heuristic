To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to potentially find more opportunities to acquire coins or items. This action is necessary as it moves the Bandit away from the Crossroads, where she could be a threat to Tom.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom will walk to the Market to retrieve the medicine from the Merchant. This action is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

3. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom will buy the medicine from the Merchant using the coin he has. This action is crucial for Tom to fulfill his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads with the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to progress towards his ultimate goal of reaching the cottage.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk to the Crossroads to meet Tom. This action is important as it allows the Merchant to be in the same location as Tom, facilitating further transactions.

6. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, thus increasing her total coins without committing a crime. This action is essential for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

7. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market, where she can continue her business and potentially acquire more coins. This action is necessary for her to maintain her preferred location.
