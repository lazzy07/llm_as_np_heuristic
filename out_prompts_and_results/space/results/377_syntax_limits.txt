Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the dangerous surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. She knows she needs to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both their safety. Since they are already on good terms, Zoe decides to take a proactive step.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action solidifies their friendship and aligns their goals of being healthy and safe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: With their newfound friendship, Zoe suggests they move to the cave, which is safer from the volcanic eruption. They walk together to the cave, ensuring they are out of danger.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Once in the cave, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship to gather supplies and prepare for a safe return to the surface, ensuring she can help the Lizard and any other creatures on the planet.

By making peace with the Lizard and moving to a safer location, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
