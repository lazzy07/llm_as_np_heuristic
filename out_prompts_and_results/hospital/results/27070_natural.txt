**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Ross, who is currently in Patient Room A and exhibiting a fever, a symptom of the disease Flaze. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Ross has a fever, and treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is only 1, there is no risk of making a mistake.
