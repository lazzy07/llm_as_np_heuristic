To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant buys the medicine from herself**: The Merchant can buy the medicine from her own stock using one of the coins she has. This action is necessary because it allows her to sell the medicine to Tom later, thus increasing her coin count.

2. **Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant**: Tom, who wants to be at the cottage carrying the medicine, will buy the medicine from the Merchant using the coin he has. This action is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage.

3. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads**: After selling the medicine, the Merchant will walk to the Crossroads to position herself for further transactions or to return to the Market if needed.

4. **Merchant walks back to the Market**: The Merchant will return to the Market to continue her business and potentially sell more items or acquire more coins.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity, while also allowing Tom to fulfill his desire to carry the medicine to the cottage.
