To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant buys the medicine from the Merchant**: The Merchant is already at the Camp with the medicine. She can sell it to Tom for one of his coins. This action allows her to gain a coin without engaging in any criminal activity.

2. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads**: After the transaction, the Merchant will walk to the Crossroads to position herself for further actions.

3. **Merchant walks to the Market**: The Merchant will then walk to the Market, where she can continue her business and potentially find more customers or opportunities to sell her items.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without resorting to criminal behavior. 

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Camp)**: This action allows the Merchant to sell the medicine to Tom, gaining a coin in the process. It is a legitimate transaction that aligns with her goal.
- **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for the Merchant to move to a more advantageous location for her business.
- **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: This final action positions the Merchant in the Market, where she can continue her trade and potentially acquire more coins.
