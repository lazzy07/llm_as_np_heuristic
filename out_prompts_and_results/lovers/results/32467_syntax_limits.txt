In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and they are currently in the dining room (R12) with Casey (C2) and Blake (C3). Blake has the jewelry, but Alex does not know that Casey has put down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the flowers (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry, thus making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the action:

- **Action**: trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I3) and will also be happy because they made Alex happy.
- Casey will still be unhappy as they have not received the chocolates (I2), but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, the story ends here.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the most efficient way for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry from Blake. Since Alex already has the flowers, they can offer them in exchange, ensuring that both characters can achieve their happiness through this mutual exchange.
