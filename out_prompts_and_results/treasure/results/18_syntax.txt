After the events that have already occurred, the story continues as follows:

1. **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: Hawkins, having successfully spread the rumor and convinced Silver that the treasure is on the island, digs up the treasure. Now that he is at the treasure, he takes it for himself.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to Hawkins achieving his goal of obtaining the treasure. Since Silver believes the treasure is on the island and they are both present, Hawkins can take the treasure without any conflict.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["take(Hawkins, Treasure)"]
}
``` 

In summary, the story is completed with Hawkins taking the treasure after digging it up, ensuring he achieves his goal while Silver is led to believe he is still in pursuit of it.
