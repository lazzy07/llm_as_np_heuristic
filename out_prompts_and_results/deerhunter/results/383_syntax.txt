To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the clerk, and he is hungry and greedy. The clerk also has money, which Bubba desires. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to threaten the bank clerk and take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle between Bubba and the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and the bank clerk is dead, which also satisfies the condition of Bambi being alive or dead, but in this case, Bambi's fate is irrelevant to the outcome.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to have the means to threaten the clerk and take the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action directly leads to the clerk's death, allowing Bubba to take the money without resistance.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
