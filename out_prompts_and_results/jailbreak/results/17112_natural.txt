**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Ernest realizes he must act quickly to protect himself and his friend Roy from the bully's threats. He decides to do his chores in the laundry room, hoping to find a way to help Roy.

1. **Ernest goes to the laundry room.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to complete his chores and potentially find a way to help Roy.)
   
While in the laundry room, Ernest finds the civilian clothes. He knows that disguising himself could be crucial for his survival.

2. **Ernest steals the civilian clothes.** (This action allows Ernest to prepare for a potential escape, which is vital for his survival.)

Meanwhile, in the gym, Roy is still threatened by the bully. He knows he needs to find a way to defend himself and Ernest. 

3. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from easily accessing Roy and gives him a moment to think about his next move.)

With the gym door locked, Roy feels a bit safer but knows he needs to act fast. He decides to confront the bully.

4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is necessary for Roy to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both his and Ernest's safety.)

After killing the bully, Roy feels a rush of adrenaline and quickly checks the area for any signs of the cigarettes. He finds them hidden in the gym.

5. **Roy takes the pack of cigarettes.** (This action allows Roy to have the cigarettes, fulfilling his desire and potentially using them as leverage later.)

Now that the bully is dead and the cigarettes are in his possession, Roy decides to escape. He unlocks the gym door and heads towards the hallway.

6. **Roy goes to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to make his way towards the highway for escape.)

Once in the hallway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself.

7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action is crucial for Roy to avoid detection by the guards as he makes his escape.)

Finally, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway.

8. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows Roy to escape the prison successfully.)

With the bully dead and the threat eliminated, Roy escapes into the night, leaving the prison behind.
