1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle and is in the bank. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money.

2. **Go**: Bubba will go from the Bank to the Forest. This action is necessary to reach Bambi, who is in the forest.

3. **Shoot**: Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and having a loaded rifle, decides to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
