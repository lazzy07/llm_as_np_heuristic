To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is already at the Market, so she can walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to create distance from the Bandit and to position herself for the next action.

2. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Merchant can then walk to the Cottage. This action is necessary because it allows her to leave the Market, where the Bandit and the Guard are present, and to find a safe place to store her coins.

3. **take(Merchant, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant can take the coins from the Banditâ€™s chest at the Camp. This action is necessary for the Merchant to acquire coins without engaging in criminal activity, as she is not robbing or attacking anyone.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired coins without becoming a criminal, achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions are about moving away from danger (the Bandit and the Guard) and finding a safe place to store her coins.
- The last action allows the Merchant to gain coins without committing a crime, thus fulfilling her goal.
