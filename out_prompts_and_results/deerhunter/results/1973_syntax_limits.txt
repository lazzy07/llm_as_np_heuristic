To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the Forest to the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential as it allows Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located. Without this action, he cannot interact with the bank clerk or obtain the money.
  
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money, achieving the story's goal.
