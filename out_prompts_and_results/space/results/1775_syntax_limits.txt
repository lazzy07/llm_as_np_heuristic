In this story, we will have Zoe teleport from the spaceship to the surface of the planet, where she will encounter the Lizard. The Lizard is currently on the surface and is in a dangerous situation due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe's goal is to make friends with the Lizard, and the Lizard also desires friendship. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary for her to meet the Lizard and attempt to establish a friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to make peace. Since they are not fighting, this action allows them to become friends, fulfilling both characters' desires for friendship.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

In this scenario, Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship before the volcano erupts. However, since the eruption is dangerous, it results in Zoe's death, which aligns with the story's requirement of a character dying.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that both characters achieve their goals of friendship, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano and the death of Zoe, completing the story as required.
