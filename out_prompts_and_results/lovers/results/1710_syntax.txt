To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to pick up the item they want to give to Casey.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This is essential for Blake to have the item they want to give to Alex, which will help Alex become happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary to facilitate the next action where Blake can interact with Alex and Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex. This is important because it allows Alex to become happy, which is one of Blake's goals.

5. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the jewelry (I3) is located. This is necessary for Alex to pick up the item that Casey wants.

6. **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex picks up the jewelry. This is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill Casey's desire.

7. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary for the final action where Alex can give the jewelry to Casey.

8. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey. This is the final action that ensures Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
