To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially use the rifle.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the Forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to obtain money, and shooting Bambi will allow him to eat her, fulfilling his hunger and potentially gaining resources.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat her. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a priority for him.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will return to the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to be back at the location where the money is held.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will steal the money from the Clerk while he has the rifle loaded. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and greed, ultimately leading to him acquiring money.
