To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is in the dining room (R12), but its exact location is unknown to Blake. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to check for the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to help Blake.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Blake is.
   - This action is necessary to bring the jewelry to Blake.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want, thus making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
