After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain energy. After eating, Bubba feels a surge of greed and decides to go to the bank to steal money from the bank clerk. He knows the clerk has money and is still alive, so he loads his rifle again to ensure he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using his rifle as a threat. This action fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
