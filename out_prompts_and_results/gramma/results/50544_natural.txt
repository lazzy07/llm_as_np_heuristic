To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to fulfill Tom's goal of carrying the medicine, as he is now at the cottage.

The story is very short because Tom's goal is straightforward: he needs to get to the cottage with the medicine. The other characters' actions are not relevant to Tom's goal, so they are not included in the story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.",
    "Tom uses the medicine."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage while carrying the medicine, thus achieving his goal.
