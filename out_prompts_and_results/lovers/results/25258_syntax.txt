To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake is currently in the dining room (R21) and wants to be happy.** Blake's happiness is contingent on having the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). 
2. **Alex is in the dining room (R22) and is already happy with the flowers (I1).** 
3. **Casey is in the dining room (R22) and is also happy with the jewelry (I3).** 

Since Blake wants the chocolates (I2), which are currently in the living room (R21), Blake needs to get them. 

### Actions to Achieve Blake's Goal:

1. **Blake moves to the living room (R21 to R22)**: This is necessary for Blake to access the chocolates.
2. **Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R22)**: This is necessary for Blake to obtain the item they want.
3. **Blake moves back to the dining room (R22 to R21)**: This is necessary for Blake to be in a room where they can be happy with the chocolates.
4. **Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21)**: This action is necessary because it will make Alex happy, which is also Blake's goal.
5. **Blake picks up the flowers (I1) from Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21)**: This is necessary for Blake to achieve their own happiness by obtaining the item they want.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Move (Blake to R22)**: Blake needs to be in the living room to access the chocolates.
- **Pick up (Blake, I2, R22)**: Blake needs to obtain the chocolates to be happy.
- **Move (Blake to R21)**: Blake needs to return to the dining room to interact with Alex.
