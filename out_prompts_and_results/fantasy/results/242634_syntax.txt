To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has a proposed relationship with Rory, but she is already engaged to Vince. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village to be in a location where she can interact with Vince and Rory more easily.
2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory also travels back to the village, allowing for a potential resolution of the relationship dynamics.
3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which will make both of them happy. This fulfills Talia's goal of happiness.
4. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels back to the cave to be with Talia and Rory.
5. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave to be with Talia and Vince.
6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which removes him from the story but does not affect Talia's happiness or wealth since she is already married to Vince and has the treasure.

After these actions, Talia is married to Vince, which makes her happy, and she possesses the treasure, which makes her wealthy. 

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **Travel actions**: These are necessary to bring characters to the same location for interactions and decisions.
- **Marry action**: This is crucial for Talia to achieve her happiness goal.
- **Eat action**: This action is included to remove Rory from the story, as his presence is no longer needed for Talia to achieve her goals.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Talia, Cave, Village)",
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Talia, Vince, Village)",
    "travel(Vince, Village, Cave)",
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures Talia achieves her goals of happiness and wealth efficiently.
