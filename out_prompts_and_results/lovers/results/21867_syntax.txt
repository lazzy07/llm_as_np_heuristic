To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is necessary for Alex to be with the other characters after obtaining the flowers.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is important because it helps Casey to be happy, which is also a goal for Alex.

5. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want. This is necessary for Blake to achieve their own happiness.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This is essential for Blake to obtain the item they want.

7. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves back to the living room to be with Alex and Casey.

8. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex. This action ensures that Alex has another item they want, contributing to their happiness.

9. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the jewelry (I3) that they want. This is necessary for Casey to achieve their own happiness.

10. **pick_up(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry. This is essential for Casey to obtain the item they want.

11. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room to be with Alex and Blake.

12. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action helps Blake to be happy, which is also a goal for Casey.

After these actions, Alex has the flowers, which makes them happy. Blake has the chocolates, and Casey has the jewelry, making them happy as well.

    "move(C1, R12, R21)",

    "move(C3, R12, R21)",
