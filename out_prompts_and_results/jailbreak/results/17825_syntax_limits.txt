**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Ernest realizes he is trapped with the bully, who is now aware of his presence. The bully, feeling threatened by the lock, becomes aggressive. However, Ernest has a plan. He quickly grabs the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously noted was there, and confronts the bully. In a moment of desperation, he uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring his own safety and that of his friend Roy.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping. He takes a moment to catch his breath and then heads to the hallway. Once there, he crawls through the vents to reach the highway. Finally, he puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he steps out onto the highway and successfully escapes from the prison.
