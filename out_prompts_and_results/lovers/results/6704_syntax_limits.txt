To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the living room (R22) and the flowers are also in the living room. Since Alex is already in the same room as the flowers, the simplest action for Alex to take is to pick up the flowers.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the living room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers they wanted.

### Explanation of the action:
- The action of picking up the flowers is necessary because it directly leads to Alex achieving their goal of happiness. Since the flowers are in the same room as Alex, this action is both efficient and effective.
