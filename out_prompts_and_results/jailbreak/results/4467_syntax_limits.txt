**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry and kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he has the pack of cigarettes he stole from him. Feeling threatened, Roy decides to take action. He crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he can confront the bully.

Once in the gym, Roy locks the door behind him, ensuring that no one can interrupt their confrontation. With the knife he also stole from the kitchen, Roy prepares to take revenge on the bully, who has been a constant threat to him and Ernest. In a swift motion, he attacks the bully, killing him and finally freeing himself and Ernest from the bully's reign of terror.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Disguised, he makes his way to the highway, successfully escaping from the prison.
