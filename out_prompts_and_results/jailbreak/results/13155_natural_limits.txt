On day one, Roy, having completed his chores in the kitchen, decides to take action to help his friend Ernest. Knowing that the bully is in the gym threatening Ernest, Roy sneaks through the hallway to the gym. Once there, he finds the bully distracted and takes the opportunity to lock the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. 

With the bully now locked in, Roy pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen. He confronts the bully, who is furious and tries to fight back. However, Roy, fueled by the need to protect himself and Ernest, uses the knife to kill the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy quickly checks for the pack of cigarettes, which he finds hidden in the bully's belongings.
