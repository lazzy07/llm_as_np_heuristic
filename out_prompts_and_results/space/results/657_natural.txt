Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having made peace and become friends. However, the surface is still dangerous due to the erupting volcano. Zoe realizes that they need to ensure their safety and the safety of the Lizard. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to assess the situation on the surface and to understand the threat posed by the volcano. 

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is triggered as Zoe is on the surface, fulfilling the condition that the volcano can erupt at any time. 

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This outcome occurs because Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, leading to her demise.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - After the eruption, the Lizard, who is also a guardian of the surface, comes to check on Zoe, demonstrating their friendship and concern.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** - Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard acknowledges their friendship and the bond they shared, solidifying their connection even in the face of tragedy.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard's actions reflect their friendship and concern for Zoe, even after the unfortunate event.
