In the cave, Zoe and the Lizard are currently safe and have established a friendly relationship. However, the volcano on the surface is still a threat, and they need to act quickly to ensure their safety. 

Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship further. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy and safe while making friends. 

After making peace, Zoe realizes that they need to leave the cave and head back to the surface to escape the impending eruption. However, she knows that teleporting back to the ship would anger the Lizard, so she chooses to walk back to the surface instead. 

As they walk to the surface, the volcano erupts, catching them off guard. Unfortunately, the eruption is too sudden, and the Lizard is unable to escape in time, resulting in its demise. 

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting and the Lizard dying, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard made peace before the tragic event.
