To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but her happiness is at 0. The treasure is at the cave, and Vince has the money. 

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, sees Rory as a potential meal. By eating Rory, Gargax can satisfy his hunger. This action also removes Rory from the story, which simplifies the situation for Talia.

2. **Vince takes the treasure**: After Gargax eats Rory, Vince can now take the treasure that is at the cave. This action increases Vince's wealth and allows him to share it with Talia.

3. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia**: Vince, wanting to make Talia happy, gives her the treasure. This action directly increases Talia's happiness.

4. **Talia becomes happy**: With the treasure given to her, Talia's happiness increases, fulfilling her goal of becoming happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary to remove one of the competing humans and allow for a clearer path to Talia's happiness.
- **Vince takes the treasure**: This action is crucial as it allows Vince to gain the treasure, which can then be used to make Talia happy.
- **Vince gives the treasure to Talia**: This action directly addresses Talia's goal of becoming happy, as receiving the treasure will fulfill her desire for wealth and happiness.
- **Talia becomes happy**: This is the final outcome we want to achieve, ensuring that Talia's happiness is realized.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Rory",
    "Vince takes the treasure",
    "Vince gives the treasure to Talia"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions leads to Talia becoming happy, fulfilling the story's requirement.
