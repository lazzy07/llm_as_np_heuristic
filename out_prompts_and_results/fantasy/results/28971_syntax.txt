To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, who has the treasure, and the fact that she can propose marriage to him. Since they are already in a relationship where Rory has proposed and Talia has accepted, they can get married, which will make them both happy. Talia can then take the treasure from Rory, which will make her wealthy.
