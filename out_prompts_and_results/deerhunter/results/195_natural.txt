To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate or threaten the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba wants to acquire the money and the clerk has it, shooting the clerk will eliminate the threat and allow Bubba to take the money without resistance.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be in the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a direct action to ensure that Bubba can take the money without any opposition, as the clerk is the only character with money.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
