To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to be with Rory and Vince, as they are both at the cave. Being with them is essential for her happiness.

2. **Talia gives the treasure to Rory.**  
   - Talia wants to be wealthy, and since she has the treasure, giving it to Rory (who has 0 wealth) will make him wealthy. This action is crucial because Rory's happiness is tied to his wealth, and Talia's happiness is also linked to Rory's happiness.

3. **Rory accepts the treasure from Talia.**  
   - This action solidifies the transfer of the treasure, ensuring that Rory is now wealthy, which contributes to his happiness.

4. **Rory proposes to Talia.**

6. **Talia and Rory get married again.**  
   - This action is symbolic and reinforces their commitment to each other, contributing to Talia's happiness.

7. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince's departure from the cave to the village is necessary to ensure that he is not in the way of Talia and Rory's relationship, allowing them to focus on their happiness.

8. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is necessary to remove Vince from the story, as he does not care about being rich and is not a direct contributor to Talia's happiness. With Vince gone, Talia can focus on her relationship with Rory.
