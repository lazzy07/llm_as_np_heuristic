**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, decides to admit Jones to Patient Room C to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to assess and treat Jones.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C to assess Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway proceeds to assess Jones. 

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones is actually experiencing an unknown condition. As a result, Jones dies.

Dr. Hathaway then returns to Patient Room B to assess Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Hathaway's workload is now back to 2 after treating Jones. Hathaway correctly assesses Young and determines that Young has Flaze, as Young is showing symptoms of fever. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Hathaway assesses Ross and mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the previous workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect since Ross is also experiencing an unknown condition. As a result, Ross dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
