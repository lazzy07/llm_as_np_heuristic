**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Ernest is in the cell block with the pack of cigarettes, but they are both threatened by the bully. To ensure their safety and to help Ernest, Roy decides to take action. 

Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where the bully is currently spending his recreation time. Once inside the gym, Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening either him or Ernest. 

With the bully locked in, Roy then retrieves the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously left there. He uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. 

Now that the bully is gone, Roy can safely return to the cell block to reunite with Ernest. They can now enjoy the pack of cigarettes together without fear.
