To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest after having shot and eaten Bambi, and he is aware that the bank clerk has money. The next logical step for Bubba is to go to the bank and steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Although Bubba already has the rifle loaded with ammunition, this action is included to emphasize that he is prepared for confrontation. It reinforces his readiness to use the rifle if necessary.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba decides to return to the house. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal but provides closure to the story by indicating that he has left the bank.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Ensures Bubba is ready for any confrontation.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: Bubba returns home after successfully stealing the money.
