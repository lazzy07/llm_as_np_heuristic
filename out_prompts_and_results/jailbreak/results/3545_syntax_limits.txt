**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, and he has the knife with him. He decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. 

Roy takes a deep breath and uses the knife to kill the bully in the gym. With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief and no longer feels threatened. He then quickly moves to the laundry room to put on the civilian clothes he had seen earlier. Once dressed in the civilian clothes, he heads to the highway, successfully escaping from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: This action is necessary for Roy to eliminate the threat posed by the bully. Since the bully has been a constant source of fear for both Roy and Ernest, killing him ensures their safety.

2. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Laundry)**: After dealing with the bully, Roy needs to disguise himself to escape the prison. Putting on civilian clothes is crucial for blending in and avoiding detection.

3. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: This final action is the culmination of Roy's efforts. By escaping, he achieves his goal of being alive and free, no longer threatened by the bully or the prison environment.
