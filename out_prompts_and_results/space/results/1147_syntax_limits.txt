To complete the story, we will focus on the actions that lead to the volcano erupting and the characters making peace. The goal is to ensure that the story ends with the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends.

1. **Action: begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action will initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to create a sense of urgency and danger, which will lead to the next actions.

2. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - After the volcano begins to erupt, Zoe will teleport to the surface to warn the Lizard. However, instead of fighting, they will realize the imminent danger and decide to make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends despite the chaos around them.

The story will unfold as follows:

- Zoe, realizing the volcano is about to erupt, decides to teleport to the surface to warn the Lizard. However, she understands that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and that they need to work together to survive.
- The Lizard, sensing the danger, is willing to listen to Zoe. They both agree to put aside their differences and become friends in the face of the impending eruption.

However, since the volcano has begun to erupt, it will eventually lead to a character dying. In this case, we can assume that the Lizard, being on the surface, will not escape in time.

Thus, the final outcome will be that the volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's demise, while Zoe and the Lizard make peace before the eruption.
