**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A. She knows that Jones is in the admissions room and has a symptom (SymptomA) that she believes corresponds to a disease. Since she has a workload of 2, she can still assess and treat patients without making a mistake.

1. **Admit Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to get Jones into an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

2. **Walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Jones walks from the admissions room to Exam Room B. This is necessary for him to be in the room where Hathaway can assess him.

3. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomA, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B. She confirms that Jones has SymptomA, which she believes corresponds to Flaze.

4. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Young walks from the admissions room to Exam Room C. This action is not strictly necessary for the completion of the story but helps to set up for any future actions if needed.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to admit Jones to an exam room, which is essential for Hathaway to be able to assess and treat him.
- The second action allows Jones to be in the correct location for assessment and treatment.
- The third action is critical as it confirms Jones's symptoms, allowing Hathaway to make an informed treatment decision.
- The fourth action is the treatment itself, which is necessary for Jones to recover and for Hathaway to achieve her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
- The fifth action is included to show Young's movement but does not impact the immediate goal of treating Jones.
