To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The current situation shows that Casey is already happy with the chocolates (I3), and Alex is unhappy because they want the flowers (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to give the chocolates to Alex.
   
2. **give(C3, I2, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is crucial because it will make Alex happy, fulfilling their desire for the chocolates.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Blake. This is important for the next action where they will trade items.

4. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I1) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is essential because it allows Blake to give away the jewelry, which is what they want.

5. **give(C2, I3, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to themselves, ensuring they are happy. This final action is necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the dining room to give chocolates to Alex.
2. **give(C3, I2, C1, R21)**: This makes Alex happy, which is important for Blake's happiness.
3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to return to the living room to trade with Blake.
4. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: This allows Blake to give away the jewelry, which is what they want.
5. **give(C2, I3, C2, R22)**: This ensures Blake is happy with the jewelry.
