Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway outside the prison. He knows that he is safe from the bully and the guards in this location. His goal is to escape from the prison and be alive. Since he is already on the highway and wearing the civilian clothes, he can simply walk away from the prison.

**Action: Ernest escapes from the prison.**

This action is included because it directly fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free. He has successfully avoided the threats posed by the bully and the prison guards by disguising himself and making it to the highway.
