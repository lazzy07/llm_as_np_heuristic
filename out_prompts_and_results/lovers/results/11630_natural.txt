To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey knows the flowers are in the bathroom and needs to retrieve them.

2. **Casey picks up the flowers in the bathroom.**  
   - Casey needs to pick up the flowers to fulfill Alex's desire for them.

3. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - After picking up the flowers, Casey needs to return to the living room where Alex is located.

4. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to fulfill Alex's wish by giving them the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is happy because they have helped Alex.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
