To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory's happiness and wealth while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave where Talia and Vince are located. This is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and Vince to achieve his goals.

2. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax, who is also in the cave, eats Vince. This action is crucial because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Rory to focus on his relationship with Talia without competition.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, this action makes both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

4. **pickup(Rory, Money, Cave)**: Rory picks up the money that Vince had. This action increases Rory's wealth, helping him achieve his goal of being wealthy.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is necessary to show that Rory is not currently hungry, as he has just married Talia and picked up money.

6. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with Talia. This action is necessary for them to enjoy their new life together.

By following these actions, Rory achieves his goals of happiness, wealth, and not being hungry.
