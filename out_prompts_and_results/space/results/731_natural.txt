To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also maintaining the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to be on the surface where the volcano is located. It also allows her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is important for their friendship.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action results in Zoe's death, which is one of the required outcomes of the story.

4. **The Lizard mourns Zoe.** - This action is implied as a result of Zoe's death, reinforcing the bond of friendship they had developed. The Lizard's reaction signifies the emotional connection they formed, even though Zoe is no longer alive.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, while also highlighting the friendship that was established between Zoe and the Lizard.
