To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom carries the medicine.**  
   - This is already established in the current situation, so no action is needed here. Tom already has the medicine.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking from the crossroads to the cottage** is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal. Since he already has the medicine, he does not need to take any further actions to acquire or use it.
