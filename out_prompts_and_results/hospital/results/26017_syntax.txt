To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Jones. This is important because Jones is currently in Admissions, and Hathaway needs to determine his symptoms to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. Similar to Ross, if Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze, and if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will walk back to Admissions to assess Young. This is important because Young is also in Admissions, and Hathaway needs to determine his symptoms to provide the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly and achieve the goal of making them healthy.
