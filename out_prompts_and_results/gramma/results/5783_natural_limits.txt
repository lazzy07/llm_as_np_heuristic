**Story Completion:**

The guard, realizing that the bandit is a criminal, decides to take action. He walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp to confront the bandit. Upon arriving at the camp, the guard attacks the bandit with his sword, successfully killing her. 

With the bandit defeated, the guard loots the bandit's corpse, taking the coins that were in the chest. This action fulfills the guard's goal of eliminating a criminal.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Guard walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp:** This action is necessary for the guard to reach the bandit and confront her, as he needs to be at the location where the bandit is to achieve his goal of killing her.

2. **Guard attacks and kills the bandit:** This action directly fulfills the guard's goal of killing a criminal, as the bandit is indeed a criminal.

3. **Guard loots the bandit's corpse:** This action is not explicitly required for the guard's goal of killing criminals, but it is a logical consequence of the guard's actions, allowing him to gain coins from the bandit.
