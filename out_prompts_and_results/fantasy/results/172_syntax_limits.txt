In the cave, Talia and Rory are together after their engagement, but they need wealth to achieve their happiness. Vince is in the village with the money, and Gargax, the dragon, is also in the cave, eyeing Talia and Rory. 

To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure in the cave.** This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth to fulfill her goal of being happy and wealthy. The treasure is located in the cave where she is currently present.

2. **Talia and Rory travel back to the village together.** This action is important as it allows Talia to bring the treasure back to the village, where Vince is located. It also keeps them together, which is essential for their relationship.

3. **Talia proposes to Vince.** This action is taken because Talia wants to secure her happiness and wealth. By proposing to Vince, she can potentially gain access to the money he possesses, which will help her achieve her goal.

4. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.** This action is crucial as it solidifies their relationship and ensures that Talia's happiness is achieved through the acceptance of her proposal.

By following these actions, Talia successfully acquires the treasure, travels to the village, and secures a relationship with Vince, which ultimately leads to her happiness and wealth.
