To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he has just shot Bambi, who is now dead. Bubba is also hungry, which means he might want to eat Bambi. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will prioritize getting money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and focus on his next goal of getting money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings him closer to his goal of obtaining money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can obtain money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Acquires money from the bank clerk, fulfilling Bubba's greedy desire.
