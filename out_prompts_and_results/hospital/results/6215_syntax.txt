To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated correctly, as he is in the same situation as Ross.

4. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that all patients are taken care of, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will walk Jones from the Admissions room to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is also assessed and treated, as he is currently unassigned and may also need care.
