**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to secure his safety and get the pack of cigarettes. 

1. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him and allows him to move more freely without being recognized as a prisoner.)
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to avoid the bully directly and get to a location where he can confront him.)
3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference.)
4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This eliminates the threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to be safe.)
5. **Ernest escapes to the highway wearing the civilian clothes.** (This is the final step to ensure his freedom and survival.)
