To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is about to erupt, which poses a danger to both characters. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety, and then she can return to the surface later to continue building a friendship with the Lizard.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the impending eruption. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface to continue her efforts to befriend the Lizard. This action is important for her goal of making friends.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes peace with him. This action is crucial as it solidifies their friendship, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Teleporting back to the surface** allows Zoe to re-engage with the Lizard after ensuring her safety.
