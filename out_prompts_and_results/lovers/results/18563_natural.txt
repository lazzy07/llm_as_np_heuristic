To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers.** (Casey is in the bedroom with the flowers, so they can pick them up.)
2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.** (Casey wants to make Alex happy, so they give the flowers to Alex.)
3. **Alex is now happy.** (Alex has the flowers they wanted.)

This sequence of actions is necessary because it directly leads to Alex achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers. The other characters' goals are not prioritized in this scenario since the focus is solely on Alex's happiness.
