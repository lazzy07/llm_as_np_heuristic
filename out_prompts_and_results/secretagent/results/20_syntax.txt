To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must first move to a location where they can confront the mastermind and then use the gun to kill them. Since the gun is not currently in the story, the secret agent must first find it. The most logical path is to move to the courtyard, then to the lobby, where the gun can be found. After acquiring the gun, the secret agent can then move to the office to confront and kill the mastermind.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Move from Dropbox to Courtyard**: The secret agent needs to leave the Dropbox to find the gun and confront the mastermind.
2. **Move from Courtyard to Lobby**: The secret agent continues to the Lobby, where the gun can be found.
3. **Find the Gun in the Lobby**: The secret agent discovers the gun in the Lobby, which is necessary for the next action.
4. **Move from Lobby to Office**: The secret agent moves to the Office, where the mastermind is located.
5. **Kill the Mastermind with the Gun in the Office**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind, achieving the goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Dropbox, Courtyard)**: The secret agent needs to leave the Dropbox to progress towards the mastermind.
2. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Lobby)**: The secret agent continues towards the Lobby to find the gun.
3. **find(SecretAgent, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent finds the gun, which is essential for killing the mastermind.
4. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The secret agent moves to the Office to confront the mastermind.
5. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent kills the mastermind, fulfilling their goal.
