To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can admit him to an exam room. This will allow Hathaway to treat him based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway should assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway can admit him to an exam room, allowing for treatment based on his symptoms.

5. **Treat Young**: Since Young is already in Exam Room A and has been assessed, Hathaway can treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomA.

    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomC, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomC)",
