To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling satisfied after his recent actions. He has successfully stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and shot Bambi, which has left him with a sense of accomplishment. He checks his pockets and confirms that he has 1 money. Bubba is hungry, but he decides to wait until he feels like eating. For now, he is content with what he has.

1. **Bubba stands in the forest** - This establishes Bubba's current location and state of mind.
2. **Bubba checks his pockets** - This action confirms that he has achieved his goal of having 1 money.
3. **Bubba decides to wait until he feels like eating** - This shows that while he is hungry, he is not compelled to take any further actions that could jeopardize his current situation.
