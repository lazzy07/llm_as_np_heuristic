To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard will initiate peace with Zoe while they are in the Cave. This action is crucial because it allows both characters to stop fighting and start building a friendship, which is essential for the Lizard's goal of making friends.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk from the Cave to the Surface. This action is necessary to ensure that the Lizard is aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano and to stay close to Zoe.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the Surface. This action is important as it keeps both characters together, allowing them to support each other in a dangerous situation.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will erupt. This action is included to demonstrate the danger of the environment, but since both characters are now friends, they can work together to find safety.

5. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the Cave to find safety from the eruption. This action is necessary for the Lizard to ensure its safety.

6. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard back to the Cave. This action ensures that both characters remain together and safe from the eruption.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
