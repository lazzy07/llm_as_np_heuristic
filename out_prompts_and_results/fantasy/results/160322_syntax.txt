To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the same location (Cave) and is alive, making him a viable target for Gargax to eat. This action will also eliminate Rory, who is a competitor for wealth and happiness.

2. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Talia, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax will take the treasure from Talia, who is still in the Cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to increase their wealth, as they already have the money taken from Vince.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is no longer hungry after eating Rory, so this action is not necessary. Instead, we can skip this step since Gargax has already satisfied their hunger.

The final sequence of actions will ensure that Gargax becomes wealthy (by acquiring the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Rory).

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory to satisfy their hunger. This action is crucial as it allows Gargax to fulfill their need for food and eliminates a competitor.

2. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax takes the treasure from Talia, which increases their wealth. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve their goal of being wealthy.
