To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is hungry and has a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to utilize the resources available in the forest.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Although Bubba already has a desire for money, this action reinforces his greed and aligns with his goal of acquiring wealth. However, since he has not yet obtained money from the bank, this action is more about his intent rather than a direct action to acquire money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending. Bubba's hunger is also satisfied, and he remains greedy, which aligns with his character's motivations.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)"
  ]
}
``` 

In summary, the actions taken are necessary to achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead, with the first two actions directly leading to Bambi's death and Bubba's satisfaction of hunger. The last action reinforces Bubba's greed, keeping him aligned with his character's motivations.
