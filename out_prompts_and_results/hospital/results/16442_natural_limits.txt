Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that he needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment. With a workload of 3, he is at risk of making a mistake, but he knows he must act quickly to ensure the health of his patients.

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to his high workload. This action is necessary to gather information about Jones's condition.

2. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly impacts Jones's health. However, since Jones is actually healthy, he remains alive and healthy after the treatment.

3. **Walk to Patient Room A and Assess Young**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. He assesses Young and finds that he is experiencing Unknown. Again, due to his high workload, he mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young, like Jones, is actually healthy, so he also remains alive and healthy.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, ensuring they remain healthy, which aligns with his goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
