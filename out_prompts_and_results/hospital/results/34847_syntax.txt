To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat Jones and Young, ensuring all patients are healthy, but this action is not necessary for Ross's immediate goal.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Admissions to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young is also treated correctly.

5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. This ensures that all patients are healthy, but again, this is not directly related to Ross's goal.

6. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in Admissions to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated correctly.

7. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway will treat Jones based on the assessment results. This ensures that all patients are healthy, but again, this is not directly related to Ross's goal.

The focus of the story is on Ross's treatment, which is the primary concern. The additional actions for Young and Jones are included to ensure the overall health of all patients, but they are not essential for Ross's immediate goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Ross is treated correctly and achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
