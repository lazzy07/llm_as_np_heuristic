### Story Completion

1. **The bandit attacks the hero.**  
   - The bandit wants to take the hero's medicine and potentially any coins the hero has. Since the hero is armed but believes they are at the market, the bandit sees an opportunity to attack and eliminate the hero, who is a criminal and poses a threat.

2. **The bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the hero.**  
   - After successfully attacking the hero, the bandit can now take the medicine from the hero's body. This action directly helps the bandit achieve her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - With the medicine in hand, the bandit returns to her preferred location, the bandit camp, where she can store her loot and coins safely.
