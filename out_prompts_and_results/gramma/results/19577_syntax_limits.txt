**Story Completion:**

After arriving at the crossroads, the Bandit sees Tom, who is unarmed and vulnerable. The Bandit decides to take advantage of this opportunity. 

1. **Action:** The Bandit robs Tom to take one of the coins he is carrying. 

This action is taken because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count without risking confrontation with an armed opponent. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can successfully rob him without any threat to her safety.

With the coin taken from Tom, the Bandit now has more coins, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

**Final Explanation:**
- The Bandit successfully robs Tom, achieving her goal of increasing her coin count. This action is the only necessary step to ensure the Bandit has more coins, as she prefers to be at the bandit camp but can achieve her goal by simply increasing her wealth at the crossroads.
