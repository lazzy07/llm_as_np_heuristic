**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to help Ernest and ensure their safety. He decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.

1. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, making it safer for him to navigate outside the prison.)

Now disguised, Roy looks for a way to help Ernest. He knows the bully is in the gym and that the gym door is locked. He decides to sneak back through the vent to the gym to confront the bully.

2. **Roy sneaks through the vent to the gym.** (This allows him to access the gym without being seen by the guards or the bully.)

Once inside the gym, Roy finds the bully, who is unaware of his presence. Roy knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest, so he decides to take action.

3. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Ernest, ensuring their safety.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to the kitchen to reunite with Ernest. He sneaks back through the vent to avoid detection.

4. **Roy sneaks through the vent back to the kitchen.** (This allows him to return safely to Ernest without being caught.)

Finally, Roy finds Ernest in the kitchen, and they can now plan their escape together.

5. **Roy tells Ernest about the bully and the civilian clothes.** (This ensures that Ernest is aware of the situation and can prepare for their escape.)

With the bully out of the way and the civilian clothes ready, they can now escape together.

6. **Roy and Ernest put on civilian clothes.** (This disguises both of them, allowing them to leave the prison without being recognized.)

7. **Roy and Ernest go to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

8. **Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** (This fulfills their goal of being alive and free.)
