To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market where she can find Tom, who is currently at the crossroads. This is necessary for the bandit to confront Tom and potentially rob him.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit robs Tom of the coin he has after arriving at the market. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to gain a coin without needing to kill Tom, thus avoiding drawing the guard's attention.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp to secure her newly acquired coin in the chest. This is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins without engaging in any lethal actions that would attract the guard's attention.
