To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is crucial because it places Zoe in the dangerous area where the eruption will occur.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: This action is included to ensure that despite the circumstances, Zoe and the Lizard have a moment of understanding and friendship before the eruption takes place. However, since Zoe is on the surface when the eruption occurs, this action will not be completed.

The final sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the relationship between Zoe and the Lizard remains friendly, as they had made peace before the eruption.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **begin_erupt**: Starts the eruption process, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk**: Moves Zoe into the danger zone, setting her up for the eruption.
- **erupt**: Causes the volcano to erupt, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
- **make_peace**: Although Zoe will not survive, this action signifies the bond formed between them, highlighting the theme of friendship even in dire circumstances.
