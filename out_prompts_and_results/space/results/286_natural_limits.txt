Zoe stands in the cave, realizing that the surface is too dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She knows that she needs to establish a connection with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety and to make a friend. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to form a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the danger posed by the volcano.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the surface.** This action is necessary for them to assess the situation together and find a way to ensure their safety. By walking together, they strengthen their bond and show mutual trust.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** This action is taken to escape the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface. Although teleporting from the surface to the spaceship would normally anger the Lizard, their newfound friendship allows for understanding and cooperation.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again on the spaceship.** This final action solidifies their friendship and ensures that they can communicate and collaborate in the future, achieving Zoe's goal of making friends.

Through these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
