The bandit, armed with her sword, stands at the crossroads with the medicine and the hero's coin. She sees the hero nearby, also at the crossroads, and decides to take action. 

The bandit approaches the hero and, using her sword, she attacks and kills him. This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate a potential threat and to take the hero's items. After the hero is dead, the bandit loots the hero's corpse, retrieving the merchant's sword and any remaining coins the hero might have had.

With the hero defeated, the bandit now has the medicine and the hero's coin, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the hero**: The bandit needs to eliminate the hero to secure her position and take his items.
2. **Loot the hero's corpse**: This allows the bandit to collect additional items, furthering her goal of accumulating coins.

The story is short and direct, focusing solely on the actions that lead to the bandit achieving her goal.
