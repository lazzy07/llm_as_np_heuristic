To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in the Admissions Room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This will ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.
