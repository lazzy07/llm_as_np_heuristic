To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted Vince's proposal, which can lead to her happiness if they marry. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.
2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with Vince.
3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village with Talia.
4. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village from the cave.
5. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels back to the village from the cave.

After these actions, Talia will be married to Vince, which makes her happy, and she will still possess the treasure, ensuring her wealth. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This is essential for Talia to achieve happiness, as she has accepted Vince's proposal.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)** and **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: These actions are necessary to move Talia and Vince back to the village, where they can be part of the community and enjoy their marriage.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)** and **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: These actions are included to ensure all characters are accounted for in the village, but they do not directly affect Talia's happiness or wealth.
