To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Crossroads with a coin.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that the Bandit maximizes her coin count by retrieving the coins she has stored.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by robbing Tom and then taking the coins from the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action allows the Bandit to ensure that she has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal of maximizing her coin count.
