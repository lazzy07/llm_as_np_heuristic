Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, is currently in Patient Room A with Young, who is showing symptoms of Fever. Since Young has Fever, Dr. Hathaway can treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for the disease Flaze.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Young is experiencing Fever, and treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy.

After treating Young, he becomes healthy. Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced by one, bringing it down to one. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address the patients in Admissions, Jones and Ross, who are both experiencing Unknown symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still manageable, he can admit one of the patients.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which will allow for appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** Assuming that Jones has a rash (the only symptom left unaddressed), this action is necessary to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated both Young and Jones, achieving his goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

The final story is as follows:

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.
3. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.
4. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.
