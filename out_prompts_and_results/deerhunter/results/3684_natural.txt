Bubba is currently at the forest, having just shot Bambi. He is hungry and wants to have money. Since he already has 1 money, he needs to ensure he can keep it and not lose it to the bank clerk. The clerk is at the bank and has 0 money, but believes that Bubba has 1 money. 

To achieve his goal of having 1 money, Bubba can take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Since Bubba is hungry and has just killed Bambi, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to feel fulfilled and not distracted by hunger.

2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action allows Bubba to eat the animal he has killed, which satisfies his hunger. 

After these actions, Bubba will have satisfied his hunger and still retain his 1 money, achieving his goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry and needs to eat to feel satisfied.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action allows Bubba to consume the deer he has killed, fulfilling his hunger.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has 1 money and is no longer hungry, achieving his goal.
