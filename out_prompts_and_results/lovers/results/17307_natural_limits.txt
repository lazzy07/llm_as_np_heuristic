In the dining room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry that Alex is holding. 

To achieve their goal, Casey decides to take action. 

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.** This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and since Alex is holding it, Casey needs to take it to be happy.

After this action, the situation changes: 
- Alex is now unhappy because they no longer have the jewelry.
- Blake is still unhappy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
