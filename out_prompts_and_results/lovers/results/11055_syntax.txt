To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to give them to Alex.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the bedroom (R21) where Alex is now happy with the flowers. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps Blake to be aware of Alex's happiness.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the bedroom (R21) to be with Blake. This action is also not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to create a sense of togetherness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
