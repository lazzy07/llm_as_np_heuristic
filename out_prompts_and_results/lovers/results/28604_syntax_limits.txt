To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R22) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) has it. 

The simplest action to achieve Alex's goal is for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the dining room.

After this action, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is necessary because it allows Casey, who currently has the jewelry, to give it to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for the item they want. This single action is sufficient to make Alex happy.
