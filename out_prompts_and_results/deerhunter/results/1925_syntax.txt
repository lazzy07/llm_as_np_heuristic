To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba obtaining the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he is currently located and go to the bank where the clerk is. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Clerk)**: The clerk, realizing the situation, will decide to give Bubba the money to avoid confrontation. This action is included to show the clerk's response to the threat.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the clerk. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and the previous actions taken to ensure he gets the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to intimidate the clerk and take the money.
- **decide_to_get_money(Clerk)**: The clerk decides to comply to avoid violence.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money, achieving his goal.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
