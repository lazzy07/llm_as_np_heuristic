Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing the patients in the exam rooms to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** 
   - This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms, which will help Hathaway determine the correct treatment. Since Young is in Patient Room B, Hathaway can assess them directly.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**
   - Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats them with antibiotics. This action is crucial for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross.**
   - This action allows Hathaway to check on the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are still in Admissions. By assessing them, Hathaway can determine their symptoms and provide the necessary treatment.

After these actions, Young is treated successfully and becomes healthy. Dr. Hathaway can then assess Jones and Ross to ensure they receive the appropriate care as well.

### Explanation of Actions:
