To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to acquire the money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the Forest to the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Although Bubba is not hungry anymore after the previous actions, this action can be interpreted as Bubba deciding to eat Bambi later, but it is not necessary for the goal of acquiring the money. However, it can be included to show Bubba's intent to consume the deer he shot.

The final story is as follows:

Bubba, after shooting Bambi, decides to go to the bank. He enters the bank and, with his rifle loaded, he steals the money from the bank clerk. With the money in hand, Bubba contemplates eating Bambi later.
