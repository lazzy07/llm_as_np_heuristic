To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The merchant will walk to the market to be in her preferred location, allowing her to sell items and maximize her coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The bandit will walk to the cottage, where she can potentially find Tom and take advantage of the situation.

3. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk to the crossroads to meet the merchant and acquire the medicine.

4. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: Tom will buy the medicine from the merchant using one of the coins he is carrying. This action is crucial as it allows Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

5. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk back to the cottage, now carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully acquires the medicine and returns to the cottage, fulfilling his goal.
