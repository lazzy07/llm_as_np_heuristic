To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant is located, as the merchant has the medicine and the bandit can potentially rob her.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit is armed and the merchant is not armed, allowing the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant. This action is crucial for the bandit to gain an item of value.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After robbing the merchant, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to either head back to the camp or to stash the medicine.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may have.

5. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having valuable items (the medicine) in her possession at the bandit camp.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that the bandit can successfully rob the merchant and return to her camp with the medicine, fulfilling her goal of carrying valuable items.
