To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Alex and Casey are. This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate the next actions.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the living room (R21). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) back to the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Casey engaged in the narrative.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
