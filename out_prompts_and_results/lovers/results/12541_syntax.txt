To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R21). This is necessary because Casey has the jewelry (I3) that Alex wants to give to Blake, and it will help facilitate the next actions.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). This action is important because it allows Alex to have an item that they can potentially trade or use to make someone else happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where the flowers (I1) are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to pick up the flowers.

4. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire to have the flowers, making them happy.

5. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21) with the flowers. This is a simple movement to return to the previous room.

6. **give(C1, I1, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Blake (C3) in the living room (R21). This action is important because it ensures that Blake is happy, which in turn makes Alex happy as well.

7. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R22) to be with Casey. This is a final movement to ensure that all characters are in the same area.

8. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2) in the dining room (R22). This action ensures that Casey is happy, completing the cycle of happiness among the characters.

By following these actions, Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers and ensuring that both Blake and Casey are also happy.
