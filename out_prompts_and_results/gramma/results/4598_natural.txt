The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, sees an opportunity to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She knows that the merchant has the medicine, which she can use to her advantage. 

1. The bandit loots the corpse of the merchant to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to have valuable items, and the medicine can be used for trade or leverage later.
2. The bandit then walks from the market to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her position and store her loot, including the medicine, in a safe place.
3. The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that she has the medicine stored safely along with her coins.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying valuable items (the medicine) and has secured her coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting the merchant's corpse**: This is essential for the bandit to gain the medicine, which adds to her collection of valuable items.
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This action is crucial for the bandit to move her loot to a secure location where she can keep it safe from any potential threats.
- **Placing the medicine in the chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully stored her valuable items, achieving her goal of having as many coins and valuable items as possible.
