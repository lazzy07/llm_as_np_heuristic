To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire the treasure and ensure his happiness. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure in the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince currently has money but no treasure. Acquiring the treasure will increase his wealth, which is one of his goals.

2. **Vince proposes to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia has already accepted Vince's previous proposal, proposing again will solidify their relationship and lead to happiness for both characters.

3. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary to complete the marriage process, which will make both Talia and Vince happy.

4. **Vince and Talia get married.**  
   - This final action ensures that both characters achieve happiness through their union.

By following these actions, Vince will achieve his goal of being happy and wealthy, while also ensuring he is not hungry since he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger.
