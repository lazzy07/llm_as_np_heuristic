To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Jones's health status is currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Young will walk from Admissions to PatientRoomC. This action is included to ensure that Young is in a position to be assessed and treated later, but it does not directly affect Jones's immediate goal.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are being looked after, even though it does not directly impact Jones's health.

5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. This ensures that all patients are healthy, aligning with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are well.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms.
2. **Treat Jones**: This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.
3. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: This action prepares Young for assessment and treatment.
4. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms.
5. **Treat Young**: This action ensures Young's health.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
```

This sequence of actions ensures that Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy while also addressing the health of Young.
