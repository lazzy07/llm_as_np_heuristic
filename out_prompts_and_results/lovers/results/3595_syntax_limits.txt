In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is not happy because they want item I1 (jewelry), which is with Casey. Casey is happy because they have item I3 (chocolates). 

To achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy, Blake can take the following action:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake is happy because they have helped Alex achieve happiness.

This sequence of actions is the shortest way for Blake to achieve their goal of making Alex happy.
