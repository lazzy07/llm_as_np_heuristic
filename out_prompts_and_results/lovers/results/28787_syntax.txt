To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with Blake, who is currently in the living room (R22) with the chocolates.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22). This is crucial because Blake is currently unhappy and needs to receive the item that Alex wants to make Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves back to the bedroom (R12) where Alex (C1) is located. This is necessary for Blake to give the jewelry to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the bedroom (R12). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
