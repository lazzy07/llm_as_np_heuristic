To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Threaten(Hero, Villain)**: The hero threatens the villain, which establishes a power dynamic where the villain must respond to the hero's threat. However, this action does not directly help the villain control the president but sets the stage for the next action.

2. **Coerce(Villain, President, Money)**: The villain coerces the president into wanting the money. Since the villain already has control over the president due to the bribe, this action reinforces that control and makes the president desire the money, which is currently with him.

3. **Give(Villain, President, Money)**: The villain gives the money to the president. This action solidifies the villain's control over the president, as the president now has the money and is under the influence of the villain.

After these actions, the villain successfully controls the president, achieving the desired ending.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Threaten(Hero, Villain)**: This action is included to show the hero's attempt to assert dominance, but it ultimately does not affect the villain's control over the president.
- **Coerce(Villain, President, Money)**: This action is crucial as it manipulates the president's desires, making him more susceptible to the villain's influence.
- **Give(Villain, President, Money)**: This final action is the key to the villain's control over the president, as it directly ties the president's power to the villain through the money.
