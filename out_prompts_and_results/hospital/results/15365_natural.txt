**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis instead of Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Jones is then assigned to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 2, Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to admit Young. Young is then assigned to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 2, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young dies.

In the end, Ross does not achieve his goal of being alive and healthy, but Jones does.
