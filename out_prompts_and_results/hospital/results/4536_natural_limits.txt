Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room B where Jones is located. Since Dr. Hathaway is overwhelmed, he mistakenly believes that Jones is experiencing Jarkis instead of the unknown symptoms. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms, but due to his high workload, he misdiagnoses Jones with Jarkis.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with steroids.**  
   - Explanation: Believing Jones has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. However, since Jones does not actually have Jarkis, this treatment is incorrect.

   - Explanation: After the treatment, Jones, despite the incorrect treatment, feels better and decides to leave the exam room, heading to Admissions, where he can confirm his health status.
