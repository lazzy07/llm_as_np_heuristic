To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the surface is dangerous due to the volcano, and both characters are currently safe and healthy. The goal is to make friends with the Lizard while ensuring they both leave the dangerous surface.

Here’s the sequence of actions Zoe will take:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave to find a safer location away from the volcano.
2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave, ensuring they are both in the same location.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe will make peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship.

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard. By moving to the cave, they avoid the danger of the erupting volcano, and by making peace, they establish a friendly relationship.
