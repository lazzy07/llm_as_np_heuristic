In this story, Gargax, the dragon, wants to be wealthy and not hungry. The treasure is located in the cave, and Gargax is already at the cave. The only obstacle is that Vince, who has the money, is dead, and Gargax can take the money from Vince's body. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will allow Gargax to achieve their goal:

1. Gargax takes the money from Vince's body. 
   - This action is necessary because Gargax needs to acquire wealth, and Vince has the money. Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money without any opposition.

2. Gargax picks up the treasure.
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is also located in the cave, and acquiring it will further increase Gargax's wealth.

After these actions, Gargax will have both the money and the treasure, achieving their goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
