To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is a dragon and does not care about happiness, will eat Rory. This action is necessary because Rory is currently in the cave with Gargax, and since Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, he will choose to eat Rory, thus fulfilling his own goal. Although this action results in Rory's death, it ultimately leads to Rory not being hungry anymore, as he is no longer alive to experience hunger.

This is the shortest story that allows Rory to achieve his goal, albeit in a tragic manner.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action is the only one that leads to Rory not being hungry anymore. While it does not lead to wealth or happiness in the traditional sense, it fulfills the condition of not being hungry, which is one of Rory's goals.
