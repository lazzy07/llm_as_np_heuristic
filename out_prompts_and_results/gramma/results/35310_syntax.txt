1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to ensure she has something valuable to trade or use later, and the Merchant is unarmed, making her an easy target.

2. **Take Coins from the Chest**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp and take the coins from the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
