To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic lie because Blake actually wants the jewelry (I2). This action is necessary to create a situation where Alex believes they need to help Blake.

3. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. Since Blake has successfully misled Alex into thinking they want the chocolates, this action allows Blake to receive an item.

4. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R12) after receiving the chocolates. This is necessary for Blake to be in a position to interact with Casey.

5. **tell(C2, C3, I3, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I3). This is a truthful statement, as Blake genuinely wants the jewelry.

6. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake. This action fulfills Blake's desire and makes them happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex and Casey to interact.
- **tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake lies to Alex to manipulate the situation in their favor.
- **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives chocolates to Blake, fulfilling the lie.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to return to the living room to interact with Casey.
- **tell(C2, C3, I3, R12)**: Blake tells Casey the truth about wanting the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
