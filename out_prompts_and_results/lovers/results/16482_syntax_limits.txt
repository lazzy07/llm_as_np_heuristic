To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R12) and has the chocolates (I3) in their possession. 

Since Casey (C3) is in the living room (R12) and has the jewelry (I1) with them, Alex can simply trade the chocolates for the jewelry. This action will make Alex happy because they will have the item they want.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this trade, Alex will be happy because they will possess the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade**: This action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal. By trading, Alex gives away the chocolates they have (which they do not want) in exchange for the jewelry (which they do want).
