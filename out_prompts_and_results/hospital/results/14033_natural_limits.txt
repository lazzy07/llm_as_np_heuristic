Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway is unaware of the specific disease but decides to treat him with antibiotics, believing it might be Flaze. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to attempt to help Ross, even though there is a risk of misdiagnosis.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. If Ross has Flaze, he will become healthy; if he has Jarkis, he will unfortunately die. However, this action is necessary to fulfill Hathaway's goal of ensuring patients are healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action is important because it allows Hathaway to continue helping patients, ensuring that Young can be assessed and treated next.

In this scenario, the story ends with the potential for Ross to be healthy, and Young is now assigned to an exam room for further care.
