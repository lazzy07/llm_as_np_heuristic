**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym with Roy, and he fears for both their lives. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to the gym where Roy and the bully are.)
   
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to enter the gym without being seen, avoiding the bully's immediate threat.)

3. **Ernest locks the gym door behind him.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Ernest a moment to strategize.)

4. **Ernest finds the knife in the kitchen.** (This is a crucial item that will allow him to defend himself and potentially get revenge on the bully.)

5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action resolves the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Roy are safe.)

With the bully dead, Ernest and Roy can now breathe a sigh of relief. They have overcome the bully's threats, and while the situation is dire, they have survived the day.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at either escaping the bully's threats or getting revenge. Moving to the hallway and crawling through the vents allows him to avoid confrontation. Locking the gym door secures the area, and finding the knife is essential for the final confrontation. Killing the bully resolves the immediate danger and allows for a potential escape later.
