In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure from the cave, as it will make him wealthy, and he is currently not hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Rory to reach the location where the treasure is located. 

2. **Rory picks up the treasure.** - By picking up the treasure, Rory achieves wealth, which is one of his goals. 

3. **Rory travels back to the village.** - This action is necessary for Rory to return to the village, where he can share his newfound wealth with Talia and Vince, potentially increasing his happiness.

4. **Rory shares the treasure with Talia and Vince.** - This action will increase Rory's happiness as he is now wealthy and has shared his wealth with his partners.
