Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, establishing a friendly relationship. To ensure their safety and to further their friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in a safe location away from the erupting volcano and to continue building her friendship with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important for the Lizard to ensure its own safety and to maintain the bond of friendship that has just been established.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action demonstrates the danger that was present and reinforces the importance of their decision to move to the cave.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action can be seen as a reaffirmation of their friendship in a safe environment. It solidifies their bond and ensures that both characters feel secure and happy.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.
