Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on them without confusion. After assessing Young, Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the attention they need.
