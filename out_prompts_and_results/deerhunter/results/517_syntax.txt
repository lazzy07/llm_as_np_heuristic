To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. The clerk is also in the bank and is greedy, wanting money. Bambi is in the forest and is alive.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk because he is greedy and wants the money. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, who poses a threat to Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money and the clerk being dead. Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba obtaining the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential obstacle to Bubba's greed-driven goal of acquiring money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money from the bank, fulfilling his desire for wealth.
