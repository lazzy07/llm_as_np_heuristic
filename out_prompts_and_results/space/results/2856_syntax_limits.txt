Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She sees the Lizard nearby and realizes that they both want to be healthy and safe. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship that could benefit them both.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**  
This action is taken because Zoe wants to achieve a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which aligns with both of their goals of being healthy and safe. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the imminent danger of the volcano.

After Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, they both feel a sense of relief and safety, knowing they can rely on each other. The Lizard, now seeing Zoe as a friend, is more willing to cooperate and help her navigate the dangers of the planet.
