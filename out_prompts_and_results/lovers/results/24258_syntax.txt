To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R22). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have given away the jewelry they had.
- Blake is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they received the jewelry they wanted.

The actions are necessary to ensure that Casey gets what they want, which is the goal of the story.
