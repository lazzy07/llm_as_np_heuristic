Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She sees the Lizard nearby and realizes that they both want to be healthy and safe. Instead of fighting, she decides to approach the Lizard and make peace.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**  
This action is chosen because Zoe's goal is to make friends with the Lizard, and since they are not fighting, this is the perfect opportunity to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, Zoe ensures both she and the Lizard can work together to stay safe from the volcano.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can collaborate to find a safe place away from the volcano, fulfilling both their desires for safety and friendship.
