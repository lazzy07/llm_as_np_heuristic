**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being 2. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, he survives the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. Young is also experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is again incorrect, but Young survives the treatment as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids, which is incorrect. However, Ross also survives the treatment.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving their goal.
