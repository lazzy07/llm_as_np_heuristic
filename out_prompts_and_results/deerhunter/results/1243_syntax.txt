To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a loaded rifle, and is greedy. The bank clerk has no money, but Bubba can still take action to achieve his goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and take control of the situation. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only one who can potentially stop Bubba from getting money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a goal he has, and it also allows him to gain sustenance.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba decides to get money. This action is included to ensure that Bubba's greed is satisfied, as he is now in a position to take any money that might be available.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is the culmination of his efforts to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take control of the bank without opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's ultimate goal of obtaining money.
