To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit moves to the Merchant's location to confront her and potentially rob her of the medicine or coins.
2. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Merchant)**: The bandit robs the Merchant, taking the medicine she is carrying. This action is possible because the Merchant is not armed with a sword.
3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Camp)**: The bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she has acquired.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying the medicine and potentially having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit needs to reach the Merchant to take action against her.
- **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Merchant)**: This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the Merchant, which is a valuable item for her.
- **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Camp)**: The bandit moves to the camp to secure her loot and fulfill her goal of having items in her possession.
