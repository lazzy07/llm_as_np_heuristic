**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest realizes that he is still threatened by the bully. He knows he needs to escape the prison to ensure his safety and to enjoy his pack of cigarettes without fear. 

Ernest decides to take action. He moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he can access the vents. He crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison.
