Bubba is hungry and wants to have money. Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. After eating, Bubba will have the energy to go back to the bank and steal the clerk's money, as he has the rifle loaded with ammunition.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger. Eating Bambi will help him regain energy.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his goal of obtaining money.
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: After eating, Bubba travels to the bank where the clerk is located.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can intimidate the clerk and take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Each action is necessary to ensure Bubba satisfies his hunger first, which is crucial for him to be able to execute the next steps effectively. The final action of stealing the money is the culmination of his plan to achieve his goal.
