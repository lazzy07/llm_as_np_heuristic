To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, we can outline the following actions:

1. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - Blake wants the chocolates, so this action is essential for Blake to achieve happiness.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to return to the living room to interact with Casey.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to receive the chocolates, which is a necessary step for Casey to feel happy.

5. **Casey gives the flowers to Blake in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to trade the flowers for the jewelry, which is what Casey wants.

6. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This final action allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

2. Blake picks up the chocolates.
3. Blake returns to the living room.
4. Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.
