**Story Completion:**

On day two, Roy, who is currently in the gym with the bully, realizes that he needs to escape the prison to ensure his safety. He has a knife, which he can use to eliminate the threat posed by the bully. 

Roy decides to take action. He uses the knife to kill the bully in the gym. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing him to focus on escaping. 

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely move to the hallway. He crawls through the vents to reach the highway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Once disguised, he can escape from the prison.
