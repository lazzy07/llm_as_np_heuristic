Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. Since she is currently not safe on the surface, teleporting to the spaceship is the best option to avoid danger.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard and continue building their friendship. This action shows her commitment to the Lizard and their relationship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They both walk to the cave, which is a safe location away from the erupting volcano. This action allows them to find a secure place where they can continue to bond and communicate without the threat of danger.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace solidifies their bond and ensures that they are both committed to being allies. This action is essential for both characters to feel secure in their friendship.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard discuss their future plans.** - They talk about how they can work together to protect each other and the planet, which helps them both achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
