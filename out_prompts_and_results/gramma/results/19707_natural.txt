**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She sees the guard and the merchant, both unaware of her intentions. The bandit approaches the guard and reports the location of the bandit (herself) to distract him. 

1. **Bandit reports her location to the guard.** This action is taken to create confusion and divert the guard's attention, allowing the bandit to act without immediate threat.

While the guard is distracted, the bandit quickly turns her attention to the merchant, who is still holding the medicine. 

2. **Bandit attacks the merchant.** The bandit uses her sword to attack the merchant, who is unarmed and unable to defend herself. This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate the merchant and take the medicine.

3. **Bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant.** After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit takes the medicine, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins or items as possible.

At this point, the bandit has successfully acquired the medicine, which she can either keep or sell later for coins, thus fulfilling her goal of having valuable items.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit reports her location to the guard to create a distraction, allowing her to act without immediate danger.
- The attack on the merchant is essential for the bandit to eliminate a potential threat and acquire the medicine.
- Looting the medicine from the merchant's corpse is the final step to ensure the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying valuable items.
