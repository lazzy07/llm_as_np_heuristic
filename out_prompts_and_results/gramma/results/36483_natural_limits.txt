The bandit, having successfully looted the medicine from the merchant and attacked the hero, now stands at the market with the guard nearby. The bandit knows that the guard is armed and poses a threat, but she also has the medicine, which is valuable. 

To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit decides to take a calculated risk. She will rob the guard, who is not expecting an attack from her. 

The bandit approaches the guard and, wielding her sword, she attacks him. The guard, caught off guard, is unable to defend himself and is killed. The bandit then loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword and any coins he may have had. 

With the guard dead, the bandit now has the medicine, her own sword, and the guard's sword, which she can use to further her criminal endeavors. She also has the opportunity to take any coins the guard had, thus achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
