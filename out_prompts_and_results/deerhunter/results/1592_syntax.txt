To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money, which is his goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene after committing the theft.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba, now having achieved his goal of obtaining money, will decide to eat. This action is included to show that Bubba is also hungry and wants to satisfy that need after the theft.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank. This action is necessary to set up the next step, where he can potentially confront the clerk again if needed.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If Bubba feels threatened or if the clerk tries to stop him, he will shoot the clerk. This action is included to ensure that Bubba can eliminate any potential threat to his newly acquired money.

The story ends with Bubba successfully achieving his goal of obtaining money, while also addressing his hunger.
