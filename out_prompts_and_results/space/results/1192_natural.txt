Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano, decides to take action to help her friend. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and assist him, as she knows the surface is dangerous and wants to ensure the Lizard's safety.

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** - By walking towards the Lizard, Zoe can communicate and assess the situation, reinforcing their friendship and showing her concern for his well-being.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action solidifies their bond and ensures that they are united in facing the danger of the volcano together.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is a natural consequence of the story's setting and leads to the climax where the danger becomes real.

5. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - In a desperate attempt to save herself, Zoe teleports away, leaving the Lizard behind.

6. **The Lizard dies due to the eruption.** - This tragic ending occurs because the Lizard was unable to escape the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and the reaffirmation of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the tragic event.
