To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to engage with the Lizard, as she believes the Lizard is there and she wants to make friends.
2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to approach the Lizard and initiate a friendly interaction.
3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship and ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.
4. **Erupt (Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is in the cave with the Lizard, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger of the surface and reinforce the need for Zoe to be in the cave.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy.
