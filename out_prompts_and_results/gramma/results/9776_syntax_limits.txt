To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom needs to walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage to fulfill his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine he has.

This action is the only one required because Tom already has the medicine and is currently at the Crossroads. By walking directly to the Cottage, he successfully completes his objective without any need for conflict or additional actions.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan is efficient and directly leads to Tom achieving his goal with minimal actions.
