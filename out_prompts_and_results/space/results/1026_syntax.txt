To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to stop any potential fighting and start building a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is necessary to explore the cave, which may provide a safe haven from the erupting volcano.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is included to illustrate the urgency of finding safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is already in the cave, she is safe. This action emphasizes the danger of the surface and the importance of having moved to the cave.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will invite the Lizard to join her in the cave, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring both characters are safe from the eruption. This action is essential for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
