**Story Completion:**

1. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary because it leads to both characters becoming happy, which is one of Talia's goals. Since Rory proposed to Talia, accepting the proposal is the next logical step to fulfill their mutual desire for happiness.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is essential for Talia to become wealthy. Since the treasure is located in the cave where Talia is currently, picking it up directly contributes to her wealth.

3. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action is included to remove Rory from the story, as he is no longer needed for Talia to achieve her goals. With Rory gone, Talia can focus on her own happiness and wealth without the complications of their relationship.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action ensures Talia's happiness by solidifying her relationship with Rory, which is a key aspect of her character's desires.
- The second action directly addresses Talia's goal of becoming wealthy by acquiring the treasure.
- The third action simplifies the narrative by eliminating Rory, allowing Talia to focus on her own goals without the need for Rory's presence.
