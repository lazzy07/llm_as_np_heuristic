To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves to the bedroom where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R11)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential interactions with other characters.

4. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Blake moves to the bedroom to check on Alex. This action shows Blake's concern for Alex's happiness.

5. **move(C3, R12, R11)**: Casey also moves to the bedroom, following Blake. This action indicates Casey's interest in supporting both Blake and Alex.

6. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to Blake. This action is included to show Alex's willingness to share their happiness with Blake, which is part of their character.

7. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the living room with the flowers. This action is included to show that Blake is now happy with the flowers.

8. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey follows Blake to the living room. This action shows Casey's support for Blake.

9. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake gives chocolates to Casey. This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy, fulfilling their desire.

10. **give(C3, I3, C1, R21)**: Casey gives jewelry to Alex. This action ensures that Alex is now happy as well.

At the end of these actions, all characters are happy because they have received the items they wanted.
