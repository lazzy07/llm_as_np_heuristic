Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She understands that the Lizard is in danger and that they need to work together to survive. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help him, as she believes the surface is dangerous but also knows the Lizard is the guardian and may need assistance.

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** - By walking towards the Lizard, Zoe shows her intention to communicate and help rather than fight, which is essential for building a friendship.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, aligning with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and ensuring safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - This final action ensures that both characters are safe from the erupting surface, as they move to a secure location together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
