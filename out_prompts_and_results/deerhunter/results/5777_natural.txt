To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba wants to have money, and since he has a loaded rifle, he can steal from the clerk.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring 1 money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money. He recognizes that the clerk has money and that he can take it since he is armed.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is the culmination of Bubba's decision to steal. It results in Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.
