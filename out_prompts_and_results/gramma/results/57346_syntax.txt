To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit has already looted Tom's coin after attacking him. This action is necessary to ensure the Bandit has at least one coin, which is part of her goal.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.
