To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth, and the treasure is located in the cave.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**
