In this story, the Guard's goal is to kill criminals. After the events that have transpired, Tom is now a criminal and is at the Crossroads, while the Bandit is still alive and presumably at the Bandit Camp. The Guard, who is at the Crossroads, can take action against Tom, who is also present.

The Guard will attack Tom, as he is now a criminal and poses a threat. This action directly fulfills the Guard's goal of eliminating a criminal.

Hereâ€™s the complete story:

1. The Guard, armed with his sword, sees Tom at the Crossroads. Knowing that Tom has just committed a crime by attacking the Merchant, the Guard decides to take action.
2. The Guard attacks Tom at the Crossroads, successfully killing him.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to the Guard achieving his goal of killing a criminal.
