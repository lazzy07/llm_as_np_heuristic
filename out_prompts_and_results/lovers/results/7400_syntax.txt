To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) is holding the jewelry (I2) in the bathroom (R12). Since Blake (C2) is currently in the dining room (R22) and wants to be happy, they need to obtain the jewelry from Casey.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room to the bathroom to be closer to Casey, who has the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to reach Casey and the item they want.

2. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey earlier for the jewelry (I2) that Casey has.
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the jewelry, which is the item they want to be happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room with the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to return to a room where they can feel comfortable and enjoy their happiness.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry, making them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to trade items.
