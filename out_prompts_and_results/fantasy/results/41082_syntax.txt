To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for him to access the treasure, which will help him achieve his goal of wealth.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Rory's wealth.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for him to be in a location where he can interact with Talia and potentially improve his happiness.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

At this point, Rory has achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure). He is also not hungry, as there are no actions that lead to hunger in this sequence.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave** allows Rory to access the treasure, which is essential for his wealth.
- **Picking up the treasure** directly increases Rory's wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
- **Traveling back to the village** is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and complete the marriage.
- **Marrying Talia** fulfills Rory's happiness goal, as he is now in a relationship with someone he loves.
