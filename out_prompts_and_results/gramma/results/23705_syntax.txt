To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is already at the Camp, and she will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with the Bandit.

2. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, will rob the Bandit, who is not armed, and take the Bandit's coins. This action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to gain coins without becoming a criminal.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: After successfully robbing the Bandit, the Merchant will walk back to the Camp to secure her coins and avoid any potential confrontation.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant maximizes her coin collection while avoiding criminality, as she does not kill or engage in any other illegal activities.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: Moves the Merchant to a location where she can interact with the Bandit.
- **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: Allows the Merchant to take coins from the Bandit without committing a crime, as the Bandit is not armed.
- **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: Returns the Merchant to a safe location with her newly acquired coins.
