To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

Here’s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room where Ross is located and assesses him. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, Admissions)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential to ensure that Ross recovers and is healthy.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
