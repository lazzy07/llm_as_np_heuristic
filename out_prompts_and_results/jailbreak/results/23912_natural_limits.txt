Roy, knowing that the bully is a threat and that he has the knife, decides to take action. He uses the knife to kill the bully in the locked gym. This action ensures that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to survive in the prison.

After killing the bully, Roy can then put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. This disguise will allow him to escape from the prison without being recognized. He then crawls through the vent to the highway, where he can safely exit the prison.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free from threats. By eliminating the bully, he removes the immediate danger, and by disguising himself and escaping, he secures his safety.
