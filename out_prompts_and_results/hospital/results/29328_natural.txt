**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Unfortunately, this is incorrect since Jones is experiencing Unknown, but the treatment does not lead to Jones's death. Instead, he remains alive but still has Unknown symptoms.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still there. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 2 again.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway again cannot identify the disease. However, he treats Ross with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, but like Jones, Ross remains alive.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room A. Young is then assessed in Patient Room A, and since Young is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Young remains alive.

In the end, all patients are alive, and Dr. Hathaway has done his best to treat them, even if the treatments were not correct.
