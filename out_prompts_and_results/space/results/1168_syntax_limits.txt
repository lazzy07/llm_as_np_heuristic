Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, which is a safe location. Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, they have already established a peaceful relationship, so the Lizard understands Zoe's need for safety.

**Action:**
1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)** - Zoe teleports to the spaceship to ensure her safety.

This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe. Since the Lizard is not fighting Zoe and they have made peace, the Lizard does not become angry about Zoe's teleportation. 

Now, Zoe is safe on the spaceship, and the Lizard remains on the surface, but they have established a friendship that can lead to future interactions.
