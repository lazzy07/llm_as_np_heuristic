Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is too high and that she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to take the following actions:

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, as she needs to determine their symptoms to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess him for any symptoms he may have. This action is crucial for managing her workload and ensuring that Jones receives the necessary care.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - Similar to Jones, admitting Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to assess him for symptoms. This is important for her to manage her patients effectively and ensure they receive the right treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is essential for Dr. Hathaway to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis. Since she is now at Patient Room A, she can check for symptoms.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy. This is the final step in achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones, and she can then proceed to assess and treat Ross and Young in their respective rooms.
