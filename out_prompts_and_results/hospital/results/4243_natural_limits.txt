Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to prioritize the health of the patients. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary because Young's symptoms are unknown, and Hathaway needs to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Young is crucial to ensure all patients are treated correctly.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A.** Since Jones is experiencing Fever, which is a symptom of Flaze, Hathaway administers antibiotics. This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B.** After assessing Young, if Hathaway determines that Young has Jarkis (which is a possibility given the unknown symptoms), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C.** Since Ross is still in Admissions and has unknown symptoms, Hathaway will assess Ross first. If Ross is found to have either disease, Hathaway will treat accordingly. This action is crucial to ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring their health.
