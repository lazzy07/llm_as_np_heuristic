Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes that Jones is alive and healthy. After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload and treats him with steroids. However, since Jones is actually healthy, he remains alive.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action reduces Hathaway's workload to 2, allowing for better focus on patient care.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Assess Jones in Patient Room A (to determine his symptoms).
2. Admit Ross to Patient Room C (to reduce workload and ensure he receives care).

This sequence of actions allows Dr. Hathaway to maintain the health of the patients while managing the workload effectively.
