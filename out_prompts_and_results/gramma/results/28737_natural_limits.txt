The bandit, armed with the merchant's sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She approaches the merchant, who is not armed and is holding the medicine. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the medicine from her. With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit returns to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her loot and count her coins.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit robs the merchant**: This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having valuable items. By taking the medicine from the merchant, she increases her value and can potentially use it for trade or leverage later.
2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp**: This action is essential for the bandit to secure her loot in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having valuable items in her possession.
