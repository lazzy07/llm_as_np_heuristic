To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse.** This action is necessary because the merchant is dead and has the medicine, which the bandit can take. The bandit is already at the crossroads, where the merchant's body is located.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her position and store the medicine and any coins she has in the bandit camp.

3. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action is necessary to ensure that the bandit has the medicine stored safely, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many items as possible.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having the medicine and potentially more coins in the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting the merchant's corpse** allows the bandit to gain valuable items without risking confrontation with the guard, who is at the market.
- **Walking to the bandit camp** secures the bandit's position and allows her to store her items safely.
- **Placing the medicine in the chest** ensures that the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many items as possible.
