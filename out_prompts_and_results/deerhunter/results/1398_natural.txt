Bubba is at the bank, feeling hungry and wanting to have money. He has already stolen the rifle from the clerk at gunpoint and has 1 money. To achieve his goal of having 1 money, he needs to ensure that he can keep the money he has and not lose it to the clerk.

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and he needs to satisfy his hunger to focus on his goal of keeping the money.
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** - Bubba needs to leave the bank to find food, as he cannot eat anything in the bank.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - In the forest, Bubba finds Bambi. Since Bambi is alive, Bubba can shoot her to eat. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to focus on keeping his money.
4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank to ensure he is safe and can keep his money.
5. **Bubba keeps the money.** - Since Bubba has already achieved his goal of having 1 money, he simply ensures he does not lose it.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and has 1 money, achieving his goal.
