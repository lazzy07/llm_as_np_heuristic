To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and get the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the bank with the stolen money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead, which is one of the goals of the story.
