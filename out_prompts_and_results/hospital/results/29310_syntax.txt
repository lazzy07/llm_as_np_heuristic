To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A. This is important to ensure that both patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary for Ross's recovery.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients receive the necessary care.
