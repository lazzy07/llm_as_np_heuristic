In this story, Zoe is currently safe on her spaceship, while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve this, Zoe will teleport from the spaceship to the surface of the planet, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to approach the Lizard and attempt to make peace, which is essential for building a friendship. 

However, since the volcano is erupting, the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous. After Zoe teleports to the surface, she will make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it will change their relationship from negative to positive, allowing them to become friends. 

The story will conclude with the volcano erupting, which will kill Zoe, but the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard will be established before that happens. This ending emphasizes the themes of connection and sacrifice.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe and the Lizard become friends.
3. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, killing Zoe.

The actions are chosen to ensure that Zoe can make peace with the Lizard before the eruption, fulfilling her goal of making friends, even at the cost of her life.
