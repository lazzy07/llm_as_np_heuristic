**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis (the rash symptom). 

2. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now aware that she needs to assess the other patients, walks to the admissions room to assess Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, where she can assess him next.

5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (the fever symptom).

6. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the treatment for Flaze. Since Ross does not have Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

7. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young.

8. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

9. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. Since Young does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, despite her mistakes, lead to the unfortunate demise of all patients. However, she has completed her assessments and treatments, fulfilling her goal of ensuring all patients are treated, albeit with tragic outcomes.
