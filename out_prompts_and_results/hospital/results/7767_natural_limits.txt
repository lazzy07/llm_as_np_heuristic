Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess and treat him. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure Jones receives care.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the available diseases.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones actually has Flaze, he will become healthy. This is a critical step to ensure Jones's health.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to another exam room to assess and treat him as well, ensuring that all patients are being attended to.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, and with Young being admitted, he can continue to work towards ensuring all patients are healthy.
