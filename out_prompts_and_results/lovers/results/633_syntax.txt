To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake wants to pick up the item that Casey desires.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Blake to have the item that Casey wants.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Casey and Alex are. This is important for Blake to be able to give the chocolates to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly contributes to Casey's happiness by providing them with the item they want.

5. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room to check on the situation. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing.

6. **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action is not necessary for Casey's happiness but shows Alex's desire to also be happy.

7. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This is again not necessary for Casey's happiness but keeps the characters together.

8. **give(C1, I3, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Blake. This action is not necessary for Casey's happiness but shows the dynamics of the relationships among the characters.

At this point, Casey has received the chocolates and is happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first four actions are focused on Blake obtaining the chocolates and giving them to Casey, which directly leads to Casey's happiness.
- The last four actions involve Alex, who is not directly contributing to Casey's happiness but adds depth to the story by showing the interconnected desires of the characters.
