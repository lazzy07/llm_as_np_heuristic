To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Since Jones is already in PatientRoomC, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, or if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms so that he can be treated appropriately.

4. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms for appropriate treatment.

6. **Treat Young in Admissions**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients effectively, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is essential to identify the correct disease and symptoms, which is the first step in providing the right treatment.
- **Treating patients**: This is the final step to ensure that each patient receives the appropriate care based on their symptoms, leading to their recovery.
