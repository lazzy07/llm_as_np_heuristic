To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **Nazis open the Ark of the Covenant in Tanis.** 
   - The Nazis believe the Ark is safe and want to gain immortality. Since the Ark is indeed safe, opening it will grant them the immortality they seek.

This is the shortest and most direct path to the Nazis achieving their goal. The Nazis do not need to travel or take any further actions since they are already in possession of the Ark and are in the same location as Indiana Jones.
