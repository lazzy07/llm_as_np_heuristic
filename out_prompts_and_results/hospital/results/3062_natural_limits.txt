Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing a fever, indicating he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to correctly identify the disease and provide the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: After identifying that Jones has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B, which allows her to manage her workload effectively by preparing to assess another patient.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring he becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
