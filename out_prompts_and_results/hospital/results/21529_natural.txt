**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (fever) instead of Jarkis (rash). 

2. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment for Flaze. However, since Young actually has Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to the Admissions room to assess the remaining patients, Jones and Ross.

4. **Admit Jones to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A, increasing her workload again.

5. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is still experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze.

6. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Jones does not have Flaze. Jones dies.

7. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions. She mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to her workload.

8. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross does not have Flaze. Ross dies.

At the end of the story, Dr. Hathaway has treated all patients, but due to her high workload and mistakes, all patients have died. However, she has done her best to help them, achieving her goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, even if the outcome was tragic.
