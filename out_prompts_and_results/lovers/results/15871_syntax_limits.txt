In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (chocolates), and Blake currently has item I1 (flowers). To achieve their goal, Blake can give the chocolates (I3) to Alex, which will make Alex happy. Since Alex wants I3 and Blake has it, this action will fulfill both of their desires.

Hereâ€™s the action Blake will take:

1. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they receive the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be:
- at(C1) = R22; happy(C1) = True; 
- at(C2) = R22; happy(C2) = False; 
- at(C3) = R22; happy(C3) = True; 
- at(I1) = R22; at(I2) = ?; at(I3) = C1; 

Blake is now happy because they have made Alex happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of the action:
- The action is necessary because it directly leads to Alex receiving the item they want (I3), which in turn fulfills Blake's desire to make Alex happy. Since Blake's happiness is contingent on Alex's happiness, this single action is sufficient to achieve Blake's goal.
