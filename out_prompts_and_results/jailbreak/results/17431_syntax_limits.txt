After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, and he has the opportunity to confront him. Ernest moves to the kitchen to retrieve the knife, which he believes will give him the upper hand. 

Once he has the knife, he heads back to the hallway and crawls through the vents to the gym. He locks the gym door behind him, ensuring that no one can interrupt their confrontation. With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully, who is taken by surprise. In a moment of desperation and determination to survive, Ernest kills the bully.
