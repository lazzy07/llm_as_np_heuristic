To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army, being armed, will take the Ark from Indiana Jones by force. This action is necessary because the US Army wants the Ark, and they believe it is currently with Jones.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army will then open the Ark. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army members who opened it. However, this is a strategic move to eliminate the Nazis, who are also in the USA and believe the Ark is with Jones.

3. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: The Nazis, believing the Ark is with the US Army, will attempt to take the Ark from the US Army. However, since the US Army is dead from opening the Ark, the Nazis will find themselves in possession of the Ark.

4. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: The Nazis will then open the Ark, believing it will grant them immortality. However, since the Ark is dangerous, this will result in their deaths as well.

After these actions, the US Army will have been eliminated, and the Nazis will also be dead, leaving the Ark without a possessor.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is crucial as it allows the US Army to take control of the Ark, which is their primary goal.
- The second action is a double-edged sword; it eliminates the US Army but also sets up the Nazis for their demise.
- The third action is a logical consequence of the previous actions, as the Nazis will attempt to claim the Ark after the US Army's demise.
- The final action ensures that the Nazis meet their end, fulfilling the story's requirement.
