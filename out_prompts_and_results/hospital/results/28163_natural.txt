**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, assesses Ross, who is experiencing a rash. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition as Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions to assess Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2, there is no risk of error.

Jones becomes healthy.
