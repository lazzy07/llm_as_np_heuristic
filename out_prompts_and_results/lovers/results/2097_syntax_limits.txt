In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(Blake, I2, Alex, I1, R22)**: Blake is in the dining room (R22) and has chocolates (I2). Alex is in the living room (R12) and wants flowers (I1), which are currently with Casey (C3) in the living room. Blake can trade the chocolates for the flowers, ensuring that Alex gets what they want.

This action is necessary because it directly helps Blake achieve their goal of making Alex happy by giving them the flowers they desire. Since Alex is now happy, Blake also achieves their goal of being happy by fulfilling Alex's wish.
