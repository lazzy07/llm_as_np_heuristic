Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads, determined to return to the cottage. He knows the bandit is nearby, but he has a plan. 

Tom decides to report the location of the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence, allowing the guard to take action against the bandit. 

The guard, upon receiving the information from Tom, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit. With the guard's sword in hand, he is prepared to deal with the criminal.
