To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the TomCoin. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs coins to fulfill her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her stolen coins.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit uses her sword to rob the Merchant, who is unarmed. This action allows the Bandit to acquire the TomCoin, which is crucial for her goal of accumulating coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After successfully robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to deposit the coins into the chest, ensuring she has coins secured at her camp.

The Bandit now has the coins she desired, achieving her goal.
