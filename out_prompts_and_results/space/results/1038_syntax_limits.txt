Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship, safe and healthy. She knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface and is not safe due to the dangerous conditions caused by the erupting volcano. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, so she decides to teleport to the surface to check on the Lizard and offer her help.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to be closer to the Lizard and to assess the situation.

Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard, who is in a precarious position due to the volcano's activity. She sees that the Lizard is in danger and decides to make peace with it, hoping to establish a friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which allows them to become friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

Now that they are friends, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to ensure their safety. Zoe suggests they both return to the spaceship, where they can be safe from the volcano.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe walks from the surface to her spaceship, leading the Lizard with her.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the spaceship, ensuring both characters are now safe.

With both characters now on the spaceship, they can enjoy their newfound friendship and work together to explore the universe safely.
