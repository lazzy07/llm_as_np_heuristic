To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom to the bathroom. This is necessary for Alex to be closer to Casey and Blake, who are both in the dining room.

2. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bathroom to the dining room where Casey and Blake are located. This is important because Alex needs to interact with them to achieve their goal.

3. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to make Casey happy, which in turn aligns with Alex's own happiness.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room to pick up the chocolates (I2). This action is not directly related to Alex's goal but is necessary for Casey to be happy.

5. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action helps to ensure that Alex is happy as well, since Alex also wants to make Casey happy.

6. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the living room to be with Alex and Casey. This action is necessary for Blake to be part of the resolution.

7. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I3) to Casey. This action helps to ensure that Casey is happy, which is important for the overall happiness of the group.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, making them happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two moves bring Alex to the same room as Casey and Blake, allowing for interaction.
- The give action from Alex to Casey ensures that Alex's goal of making Casey happy is met, which is a part of Alex's own happiness.
- The subsequent moves and give actions ensure that all characters are working towards their happiness, creating a harmonious conclusion.
