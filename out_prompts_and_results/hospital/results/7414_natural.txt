**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is showing symptoms of a rash, correctly identifies that he has Jarkis. To ensure Ross receives the appropriate treatment, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This successfully makes Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess the remaining patients. Upon arriving, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C, as Young is still in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now at 2, he can accurately assess Young without making a mistake. After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway finds that Young is also showing symptoms of a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, making Young healthy.

Now, all patients are healthy: Ross and Young have been treated successfully, and Jones is still alive and healthy as he has not been treated yet but is not showing any symptoms.
