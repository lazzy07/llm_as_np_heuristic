The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the medicine is now unguarded. She quickly walks to the merchant's body and loots the medicine. With the medicine in her possession, she returns to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her loot and keep the medicine for herself.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Walk to the merchant's body**: The bandit needs to reach the location of the medicine, which is now with the dead merchant.
2. **Loot the medicine**: This action allows the bandit to take the medicine, which is part of her goal to carry as many coins or valuable items as possible.
3. **Walk back to the bandit camp**: This ensures that the bandit can secure her new possession in a safe location.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying the medicine.
