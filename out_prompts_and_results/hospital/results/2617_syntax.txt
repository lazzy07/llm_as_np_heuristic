To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will need to assess Ross to determine his symptoms as well. This is important to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This will complete the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is also diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the first step in ensuring Jones receives the correct treatment.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomB)**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids, making him healthy.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomC)**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids, making him healthy.

By following this plan, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
