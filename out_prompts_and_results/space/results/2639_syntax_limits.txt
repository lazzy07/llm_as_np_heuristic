In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Both characters are currently safe and healthy, but they are not friends yet. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and one character die, while also ensuring that they become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendship, which is one of their goals. By making peace, they can set aside any potential conflict and work together to face the impending danger of the volcano.

2. **The volcano erupts**: This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and causing a character to die. Since the surface is already dangerous, the eruption will lead to the demise of one of the characters.

In this scenario, Zoe and the Lizard will become friends just before the eruption, but since they are on the surface when it erupts, one of them will die. 

Here’s the complete story:

Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, turns to the Lizard and says, "We need to work together to survive this!" The Lizard nods in agreement, and they both decide to make peace. Just as they shake hands, the volcano erupts violently, and the cave begins to tremble. Unfortunately, the eruption is too powerful, and the cave collapses, leading to Zoe's demise.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, one character dying, and the two characters making friends.
