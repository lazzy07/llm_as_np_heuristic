In the current situation, the US Army has the Ark, but it is dangerous. The Nazis are dead after opening the Ark, which was a fatal mistake. Indiana Jones is alive and in the USA, but he needs to ensure the Ark is safe and in the hands of the US Army.

To complete the story, Indiana Jones will take the Ark from the US Army. This action is necessary because the Ark is currently in the possession of the US Army, and Indiana needs to ensure it is safe before it can be handed back to them. After taking the Ark, Indiana will open it to determine its safety.

1. **take(Indiana, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: Indiana takes the Ark from the US Army to check its safety. This action is crucial because the Ark is dangerous, and Indiana needs to assess it before it can be safely returned to the US Army.

2. **open(Indiana, Ark, USA)**: Indiana opens the Ark to see if it is safe. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in Indiana's death, but it will also confirm the Ark's nature, ensuring that it cannot be misused again.

After these actions, the US Army will still have the Ark, but Indiana will be dead, and the Nazis are already dead from their previous actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary to ensure the Ark is not misused by the US Army, as it is currently dangerous.
