To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly, which is one of her goals.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins secured in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

With these actions, the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to take a coin from Tom, increasing her wealth and moving her closer to her goal.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action secures the Bandit's coins in her camp, ensuring that she has a stash of coins, which is another aspect of her goal.
