To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will also need to go back to the bank to steal from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because he is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk while he has the rifle loaded. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
