In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant can take advantage of the chaos in the Market after the Bandit attacked Tom. 

The Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Loot**: The Merchant can loot Tom's corpse to acquire the coin he was carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to gain a coin without committing a crime, as Tom is already dead and the Merchant is not attacking anyone.

This single action allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.
