To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who has proposed to her. Since Vince is dead, Talia has no other options for marriage. The goal is to have Talia accept Rory's proposal, which will make both of them happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling her desire to be happy.

2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures that Talia's happiness is achieved.

3. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she desires wealth.

4. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village to be with Talia after their marriage. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness or wealth but helps to maintain the relationship dynamic.

5. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave and picks up the treasure. This action further increases her wealth, aligning with her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring money and treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept**: This is the first step to Talia's happiness, as accepting Rory's proposal makes her happy.
- **marry**: This formalizes their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.
- **pickup (Money)**: This allows Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her goals.
- **travel (Rory)**: While not necessary for Talia's goals, it keeps the narrative cohesive by having Rory with Talia.
- **pickup (Treasure)**: This further increases Talia's wealth, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.
