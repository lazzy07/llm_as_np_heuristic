To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard interact in a way that leads to both characters making friends, while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's demise. This outcome aligns with the narrative's tension and the characters' goals, as Zoe's actions will ultimately lead to a tragic but meaningful conclusion.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to engage with the Lizard directly, as she wants to make friends with him.
