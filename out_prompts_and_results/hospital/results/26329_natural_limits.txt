Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway is unaware of whether he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment. After assessing Ross, Hathaway determines that he has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones. Since Jones is also experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway again assesses him. After the assessment, Hathaway determines that Jones has Jarkis due to the rash symptom. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

With both patients treated and healthy, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
