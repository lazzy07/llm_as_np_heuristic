**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest finds himself in the gym with the bully, who is still furious about the stolen cigarettes. Knowing that he is threatened, Ernest decides to take a risk. He quickly scans the gym for any potential weapons or items that could help him. However, he finds nothing useful. 

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the cell block, realizes that he must act quickly to help his friend. He decides to sneak through the hallway to the laundry room to grab the civilian clothes, hoping to disguise himself and assist Ernest. 

In the gym, the bully approaches Ernest, taunting him and making threats. Ernest, feeling cornered, knows he must act before the bully can carry out his threats. He remembers that the gym door is not locked. In a moment of desperation, he rushes to lock the gym door, trapping the bully inside with him. 

With the bully now unable to escape, Ernest takes a chance and confronts him. He manages to overpower the bully and, in a moment of adrenaline-fueled courage, he kills the bully with a hidden knife he had found earlier in the gym. 

Meanwhile, Roy, now disguised in civilian clothes, sneaks through the hallway and crawls through the vents to the highway. He successfully escapes the prison, leaving the chaos behind.
