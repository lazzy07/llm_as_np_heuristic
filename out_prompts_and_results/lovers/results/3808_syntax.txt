To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) to be closer to Alex and Blake.
   - This action is necessary to bring Casey into the same room as Alex and Blake, facilitating further interactions.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R21).
   - This action is crucial because it allows Casey to obtain the item that Alex wants, which is the flowers.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) with the flowers.
   - This action is necessary to bring the flowers to Alex, who is in the living room.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22).
   - This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

5. **happy(C1) = True**: After receiving the flowers, Alex is now happy.
   - This is the desired outcome for Alex.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. move(C3, R21, R22)
2. pick_up(C3, I1, R21)
3. move(C3, R21, R22)
4. give(C3, I1, C1, R22)

With these actions, Alex achieves their goal of happiness by receiving the flowers.
