Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, decides to take action. He is currently in the forest with a loaded rifle and has just stolen a rifle from the bank clerk. To satisfy his hunger, he spots Bambi, the deer, nearby. 

Bubba takes aim and shoots Bambi, killing her. He then eats the deer, satisfying his hunger. With his hunger alleviated, Bubba can now focus on his greed. He decides to go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk.

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat. Shooting Bambi allows him to obtain food.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats her to satisfy his hunger.
3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba then decides to go back to the bank to fulfill his greed for money.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goals of satisfying his hunger and obtaining money.
