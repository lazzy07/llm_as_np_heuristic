To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because Alex needs to give away the jewelry to make Casey happy, and in return, they will receive something that Casey values.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) will give the jewelry (I1) back to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to regain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake (C2) will move to the dining room (R21) to check on the chocolates (I2). This action is not directly related to Alex's happiness but is necessary for Blake to pursue their own happiness.

4. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake (C2) will pick up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want, contributing to their happiness.

5. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake (C2) will give the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3). This action helps Casey to be happy, which is also a goal for both Alex and Blake.

6. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey (C3) will move to the dining room (R21) to be with Alex and Blake. This action is necessary for Casey to be part of the group and enjoy the moment.

7. **put_down(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey (C3) will put down the flowers (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is not essential for Alex's happiness but allows for a more relaxed atmosphere.

8. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex (C1) will move to the dining room (R21) to join Casey and Blake. This action is necessary for Alex to be with their friends and enjoy the moment.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
