In the bathroom, Alex, who is already happy with the flowers, decides to help Blake and Casey. Alex knows that Blake wants the chocolates and Casey wants the jewelry. To achieve this, Alex can take a simple action that will lead to a resolution for everyone.

**Action:**
- Alex gives the flowers to Casey.

**Explanation:**
- By giving the flowers to Casey, Alex ensures that Casey is happy because Casey wants the jewelry, and now has the flowers, which Alex believes Casey wants. This action does not directly help Blake, but it creates a positive atmosphere in the bathroom, which may lead to further actions that can help Blake later. However, since the goal is for Alex to achieve their happiness, this action is sufficient.
