Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She sees the Lizard nearby, and instead of fighting, she decides to make peace. 

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**  
This action is taken because Zoe wants to be friends with the Lizard, and since they are not fighting, this is the perfect opportunity to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, Zoe can ensure both her safety and the Lizard's safety, as well as work towards her goal of making friends with other creatures.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to find a safe place away from the volcano, achieving their mutual goals of health, safety, and friendship.
