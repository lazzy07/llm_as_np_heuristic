To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom to the bathroom. This action is necessary to get closer to Casey, who is in the dining room and has the flowers.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This action is important because it communicates Alex's desire directly to Casey, who is currently in the dining room with the flowers.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bathroom to the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey and the flowers.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
