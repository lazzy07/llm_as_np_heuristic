To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness through their relationship. The main focus now is to acquire wealth and ensure he is not hungry.

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary because it allows Rory to acquire wealth, which is one of his goals.

2. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to find the treasure. This action is essential for Rory to pursue additional wealth.

3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

After these actions, Rory will have both the money and the treasure, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy. Additionally, since he is not hungry (as he has not taken any actions that would make him hungry), he will have achieved all his goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Rory to gain wealth by taking the money that Vince had, which is crucial for his goal.
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to go to the cave to find the treasure, which is another source of wealth.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: By picking up the treasure, Rory adds to his wealth, thus achieving his goal of being wealthy.
