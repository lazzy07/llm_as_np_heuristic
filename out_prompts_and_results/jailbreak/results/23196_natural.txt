**Story Completion:**

1. **Roy (on the highway) puts on the civilian clothes.**  
   - This action allows Roy to disguise himself, making it easier for him to escape without being recognized.

2. **Roy (in civilian clothes) escapes from the prison.**  
   - With the disguise on, Roy can successfully leave the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

- **Putting on the civilian clothes** is crucial because it allows Roy to blend in and avoid detection by the guards or the bully. Without this disguise, he would be at risk of being caught and thwarted.
  
- **Escaping from the prison** is the final action that fulfills Roy's desire to be alive and free, ensuring he is no longer threatened by the bully or the prison environment.
