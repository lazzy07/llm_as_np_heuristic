To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has the rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which will make him healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomC, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room and assesses Ross. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms, which is necessary for determining the correct treatment. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, Admissions)**: After assessing Ross and confirming he has Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is essential as it directly leads to Ross becoming healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomC, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, Admissions)"
