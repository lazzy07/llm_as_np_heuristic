To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from Market to Crossroads**: This action is necessary for the Merchant to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and has a sword.

2. **Bandit walks from Market to Crossroads**: The Bandit moves to the Crossroads to confront Tom and the Merchant, as she is looking to rob them.

3. **Bandit robs Merchant**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, will rob the Merchant, taking the coins she has. This action is crucial for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

4. **Bandit walks from Crossroads to Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will return to her camp to secure her loot.

5. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Market**: The Merchant will return to the Market to continue her business and potentially find more coins.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to avoid becoming a criminal while still achieving her goal of acquiring coins, albeit indirectly, as she loses her coins to the Bandit.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's initial movement to the Crossroads allows her to be in the vicinity of Tom and the Bandit.
- The Bandit's movement to the Crossroads is necessary for her to confront the Merchant and rob her.
- The robbery is a critical action that allows the Bandit to achieve her goal, while the Merchant's return to the Market keeps her from engaging in criminal activity.
