To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** - Rory needs to be at the same location as Talia to interact with her and potentially gain wealth.
  
2. **Rory takes the treasure from Talia.** - Since Talia has the treasure, Rory can take it from her, which will increase his wealth.

3. **Rory becomes hungry.** - This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Rory not being hungry, as he will need to eat afterward.

4. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action will remove Rory from the story, but it is a necessary step to ensure that Rory's happiness can be achieved through the treasure he has taken.

5. **Talia picks up the money from Vince.** - Talia can then take the money from Vince, which will help her achieve her own goals, but it is not directly related to Rory's happiness.

6. **Talia proposes to Rory.** - This action is to ensure that Rory's happiness is fulfilled through the marriage proposal, even if he is no longer alive.

7. **Talia accepts the proposal.** - This will make Rory happy, as he is now married to Talia.

8. **Talia and Rory get married.** - This finalizes the marriage, ensuring Rory's happiness is achieved.

In this story, Rory's goal of being happy is achieved through the marriage proposal and acceptance, even though he is eaten by Gargax. The treasure he took ensures that he is wealthy, and the actions taken lead to Talia's happiness as well.
