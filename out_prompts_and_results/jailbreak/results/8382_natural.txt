**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. He moves from the hallway to the kitchen to retrieve the knife. 

Once in the kitchen, he steals the knife, knowing it will give him a fighting chance against the bully. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway, planning to confront the bully.

Meanwhile, Roy is in the gym, doing his punishment duties. He is aware of the bully's threats and is worried about Ernest's safety. He decides to stay in the gym, hoping that Ernest can handle the situation.

Ernest, now in the hallway with the knife, knows he has to act quickly. He locks the gym door to prevent the bully from entering and to keep Roy safe. He then crawls through the vents to the cell block where the bully is located.

Once in the cell block, Ernest confronts the bully. The bully, surprised to see Ernest, tries to threaten him again. However, Ernest, armed with the knife, retaliates and kills the bully, overcoming the threat once and for all.

With the bully dead, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He knows that he and Roy can now escape together. He returns to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, and heads to the highway.
