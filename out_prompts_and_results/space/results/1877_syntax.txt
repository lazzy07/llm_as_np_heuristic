In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, having made peace with each other. However, the volcano on the surface is still a threat, and it is important to ensure that the characters are aware of the danger. To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and one character dies, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and explore the surface, despite the danger. This action is necessary to bring her into the dangerous environment where the volcano can erupt.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the surface, wanting to ensure her safety and to stay close to her. This action is important for the Lizard to maintain their friendship and protect Zoe.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts while both characters are on the surface. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting and leads to one character's demise.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, in a desperate attempt to save Zoe, pushes her away from the lava flow but ends up getting caught in it himself. This action results in the Lizard dying, which is a key part of the ending.

5. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Although the Lizard dies, the earlier peace made in the cave is significant. It shows that they had formed a bond before the tragic event, emphasizing the friendship they developed.

The story concludes with the Lizard's sacrifice, which solidifies the bond between them, even in death. The eruption serves as a dramatic climax, fulfilling the requirement of the volcano erupting and a character dying.
