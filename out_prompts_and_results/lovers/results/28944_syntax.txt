To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex (C1) will trade the flowers (I3) they picked up earlier with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3), which is not what they wanted, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, making them happy.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

### Explanation of Actions:
