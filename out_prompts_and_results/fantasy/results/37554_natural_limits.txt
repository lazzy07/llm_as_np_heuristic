In the cave, Rory, Talia, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Rory has the treasure, and Vince has the money. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, Rory decides to take action.

1. **Rory eats Vince**: This action allows Rory to eliminate a competitor for wealth and also satisfies Gargax's desire to not be hungry, as Gargax can now eat Vince. This action also allows Rory to take the money from Vince's body, increasing his wealth.

2. **Rory proposes to Talia**: After eating Vince, Rory proposes to Talia, who is now free to accept since she is no longer married to Vince. This action will make both Rory and Talia happy.

By taking these actions, Rory achieves his goal of being happy and wealthy, while also ensuring that he is not hungry.
