**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the remaining patients, Ross and Young, who are still in Admissions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action assigns Ross to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him. It also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial for determining Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to proceed with treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the workload), this action will lead to a negative outcome. However, it is necessary to attempt treatment to fulfill the story's requirements.

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Young, who is still in Admissions.

6. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action assigns Young to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms, this action will successfully treat Young, ensuring he becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients, ultimately leading to their health. The sequence of admitting and assessing patients is crucial for determining their conditions and providing the appropriate treatments. The potential mistake in treating Ross is a consequence of the workload but is necessary to illustrate the challenges faced by Dr. Hathaway.
