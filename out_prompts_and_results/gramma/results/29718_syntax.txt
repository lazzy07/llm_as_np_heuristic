To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob the Merchant's corpse**: The Bandit will loot the Merchant's corpse to take the medicine and the coins that were with her. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count and the Merchant is currently dead, making her an easy target.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest. This is essential for securing her loot and achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the medicine and the coins. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her wealth and fulfill her goal of carrying coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to secure her coins in the chest. This action is necessary to ensure that her coins are safe and that she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.
