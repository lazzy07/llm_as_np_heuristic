To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because understanding the symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Similarly, Hathaway must assess Ross to identify his symptoms. This step is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for that disease.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for that disease.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating both patients, Hathaway can walk back to the admissions room to check on Jones.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis).

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
