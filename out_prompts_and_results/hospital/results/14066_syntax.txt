To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to check on the other patients, specifically Young, who is currently in Admissions.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are taken care of and to prevent any mistakes in treatment.

5. **Treat Young**: Depending on Young's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him accordingly. This ensures that all patients are healthy, which aligns with Hathaway's goal.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's condition.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: This action is essential for Ross to recover based on the assessment.
3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway needs to check on other patients.
4. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to identify Young's condition.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: This action ensures Young also receives the correct treatment.

By following these steps, Ross will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
