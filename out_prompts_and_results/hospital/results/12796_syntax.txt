To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Hathaway Ross to Exam Room A**: Since Ross is currently in Patient Room B, Hathaway needs to assign him to an exam room for assessment. Exam Room A is chosen because it is the first available room.

2. **Assess Hathaway Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will recognize this during the assessment.

3. **Treat Hathaway Ross with Antibiotics in Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross and confirming he has Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the story with the actions taken:

1. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room A, increasing her workload to 1.
2. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A, confirming he has Flaze.
3. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics in Exam Room A, successfully curing him.

After these actions, Ross will be alive and healthy, achieving his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, ExamRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, ExamRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, ExamRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Ross is assessed correctly and treated appropriately, leading to his recovery.
