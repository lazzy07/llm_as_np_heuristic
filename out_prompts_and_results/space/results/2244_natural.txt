Zoe and the Lizard are currently at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they are enemies. To achieve a resolution where they can become friends, Zoe needs to take actions that foster understanding and cooperation rather than conflict. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of their goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better.

2. **The Lizard agrees to make peace with Zoe.** This is a necessary reciprocal action that solidifies their friendship. The Lizard, as the guardian of the planet, recognizes that Zoe's intentions are not hostile and that they can work together.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk from the cave to the surface.** They need to leave the cave to explore the surface together, which is now uninhabitable due to the eruption. This action signifies their newfound friendship and willingness to face challenges together.

4. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event is inevitable and serves as a climax to the story. It demonstrates the dangers of the planet and reinforces the need for cooperation between Zoe and the Lizard.

5. **Zoe dies in the eruption.** This tragic ending emphasizes the risks of exploration and the consequences of the environment they are in. It also serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of friendship and understanding, even in dire circumstances.

The sequence of actions leads to a resolution where Zoe and the Lizard become friends, but the eruption ultimately results in Zoe's demise, highlighting the dangers of their environment.
