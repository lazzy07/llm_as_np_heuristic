To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently in the market and has a coin. This action is necessary for the bandit to acquire coins directly from Tom, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step for the bandit to increase her coin count. Since Tom is not armed, the bandit can successfully take the coin from him.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is crucial for the bandit to move to a secure location where she can store her coins safely.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit has coins in her possession, thus achieving her goal.
