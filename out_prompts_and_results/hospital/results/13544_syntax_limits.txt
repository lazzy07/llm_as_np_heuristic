Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A with Ross, who is assigned to this room. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means they are at risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to reduce their workload and assess the patients effectively.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but assessing Ross is the first step to understanding his condition.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to check on Jones and Young. This action is necessary to gather information about their conditions and to reduce Hathaway's workload by moving away from the exam room.

3. **Admit and Assess Jones**: Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B and assesses him. This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment. By admitting Jones, Hathaway can focus on treating him without the risk of misdiagnosis.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is also essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
