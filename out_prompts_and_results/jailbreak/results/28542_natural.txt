- **Crawling through the vents to the highway** is a strategic move that helps Roy avoid the bully and the guards, ensuring he can reach the outside without confrontation.
- **Escaping from the prison** is the final action that achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free, as he successfully leaves the confines of the prison.
