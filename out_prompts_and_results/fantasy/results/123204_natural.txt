To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the money from Vince's body after Vince has been eaten. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action has already occurred, and it allows Gargax to eliminate a competitor for wealth and also to satisfy their hunger.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring the money) and is not hungry (since they just ate Vince). 

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary for Gargax to eliminate a competitor and satisfy their hunger. It has already happened in the story.
   
2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: This action allows Gargax to acquire wealth, fulfilling their goal of being wealthy.

Now, Gargax is wealthy and not hungry, achieving their goals.
