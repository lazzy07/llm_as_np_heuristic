**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, realizing their workload is high, decides to assess Ross first in PatientRoomA. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Fortunately, Ross actually has Flaze, so he becomes healthy.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway then assesses Young in PatientRoomC. With a reduced workload of 2, Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Young becomes healthy.
