To achieve Indiana Jones's goal of ensuring the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, we need to consider the current situation and the beliefs of each character. The Ark is currently with the US Army, and it is dangerous. The Nazis believe that Indiana Jones has the Ark, and they are in Tanis. The US Army believes they have the Ark, and they are in the USA.

Since the Ark is dangerous, Indiana Jones needs to ensure that the US Army does not open it, as doing so would result in death. The Nazis, believing that Jones has the Ark, will likely travel to the USA to confront him and the US Army.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis travel from Tanis to the USA, believing that Indiana Jones is there with the Ark.
2. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: The Nazis, armed and believing the Ark is with the US Army, take the Ark from the US Army by force.
3. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: The Nazis, now in possession of the Ark, open it, believing it will grant them immortality. However, since the Ark is dangerous, this action results in their deaths.

At this point, the Ark remains with the US Army, and Indiana Jones has successfully ensured that the US Army has the Ark without them opening it.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: This action is necessary for the Nazis to confront Indiana Jones and the US Army, as they believe he has the Ark.
