Ernest, realizing he is threatened by the bully in the gym, decides to take action. He knows he has the knife and the civilian clothes, which could help him escape. Since the gym is not locked, he can confront the bully directly. 

Ernest approaches the bully and, in a moment of desperation, he uses the knife to kill the bully. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both himself and Roy. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now safely escape. 

After killing the bully, Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. He then leaves the gym and heads to the hallway. From there, he crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he is free to escape.

This sequence of actions ensures that Ernest achieves his goal of being alive and not threatened, while also obtaining a pack of cigarettes indirectly by removing the bully from the equation.
