To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the Merchant's sword after attacking her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to become armed, which is crucial for her to defend herself and potentially rob or attack others in the future.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coins he is carrying. This action is essential for the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is one of her primary goals.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first arming herself, then robbing Tom for his coins, and finally securing her coins in the chest at the camp.
