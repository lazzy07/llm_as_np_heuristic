After completing their chores, Roy, who is in the laundry room, decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is a threat, especially since he has already threatened both of them. 

1. **Disguise(Roy, Clothes, Laundry)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes in the laundry room to disguise himself. This is essential for his escape plan, as he needs to blend in outside the prison.

2. **Go(Roy, Hall)**: After disguising himself, Roy moves to the hallway. This is a necessary step to access the highway where he can escape.

3. **Vent(Roy, Highway)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is crucial as it allows him to bypass the prison guards and reach the outside without being detected.

4. **Escape(Roy, Highway)**: Finally, Roy escapes from the prison. This is the ultimate goal, ensuring his survival and freedom.

By taking these actions, Roy successfully avoids the bully's threats and escapes the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
