To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to secure wealth and happiness while avoiding hunger. The following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory will travel back to the Village where Vince is located. This is necessary because Vince has the money, which Rory needs to become wealthy.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory will take the money from Vince. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory will return to the Cave with the money. This is important for him to be in the same location as Talia, who he is in a relationship with.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory will marry Talia. Since Talia has accepted his proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Traveling to the Village** allows Rory to access the money held by Vince.
- **Taking the money from Vince** is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.
- **Returning to the Cave** ensures that Rory is with Talia, allowing him to pursue happiness through marriage.
- **Marrying Talia** fulfills Rory's desire for happiness, as both characters will be happy after the marriage.
