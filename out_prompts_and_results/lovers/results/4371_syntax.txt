To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Casey moves to the living room (R22 to R12)**: This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to interact with it.

2. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R12)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the item they want, which is essential for their happiness.

3. **Casey moves back to the dining room (R12 to R22)**: This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but can be included to show that they are returning to a common area where they can interact with the other characters.

4. **Casey tells Alex that they have the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R22)**: This action is included to show that Casey is now happy and can share this happiness with Alex.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the living room to access the jewelry.
2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the dining room.
4. **tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey informs Alex that they have the jewelry, reinforcing their happiness.
