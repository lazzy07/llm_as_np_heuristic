To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Casey can also achieve happiness. Since Casey wants the jewelry, picking it up allows Casey to work towards their goal.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake will still be happy because they have given the flowers away but may not have a specific item they want.
- Casey will be happy because they have picked up the jewelry.

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers.
