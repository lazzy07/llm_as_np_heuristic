To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. Since they are both on the surface and not fighting, this action is possible. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.
