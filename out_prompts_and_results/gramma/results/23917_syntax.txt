To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the Market, so she will walk to the Crossroads to be closer to the Merchant and the Guard.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit will then walk to the Merchant's location to attempt to rob her.

3. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Merchant)**: The bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coins she has. Since the Merchant is not armed, this action is valid.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit starts at the Market and needs to move to the Crossroads to access the Merchant.
- By walking to the Merchant, she positions herself to rob her without any interference from the Guard, who is also at the Crossroads.
- The robbery is successful because the Merchant is unarmed, allowing the bandit to take the coins.
- Finally, the bandit secures her coins by placing them in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.
