Blake, wanting to be happy and also wanting Alex to be happy, decides to take action. Since Blake believes that the chocolates are in the bathroom and wants them, he picks up the jewelry from the bathroom and gives it to Alex, who wants the jewelry. This action makes Alex happy. 

Now, Blake can move to the living room where he believes the chocolates are located. Since he is now happy with the jewelry, he can focus on finding the chocolates.
