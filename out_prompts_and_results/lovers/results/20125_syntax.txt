To ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure that Casey gets the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R12) to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the bathroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Casey's goal but can be included to show movement back to a previous location.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22). This action is also not necessary for achieving Casey's goal but demonstrates further movement.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R21) to ensure they are in the right place with the jewelry.

6. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is included to show that Casey is willing to share their happiness with Alex, which aligns with their goal of making Blake happy.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) to be with Blake. This action is included to show the connection between characters and their relationships.

8. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives chocolates (I2) to Casey in the living room (R22). This action is included to ensure that Casey is happy with the chocolates, which is a secondary goal.

By following these actions, Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry they wanted.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

    "move(C3, R12, R21)",

    "move(C3, R21, R12)",
    "move(C3, R12, R22)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "give(C3, I3, C2, R21)",
    "move(C2, R21, R22)",
    "give(C2, I2, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is designed to ensure that Casey ultimately achieves happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire while also considering the happiness of the other characters involved.
