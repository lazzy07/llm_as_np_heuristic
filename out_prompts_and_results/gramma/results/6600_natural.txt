**Story Completion:**

1. **The hero (Tom) reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is taken because Tom wants to ensure the bandit is dealt with, as the bandit is a criminal and poses a threat to his goal of safely returning to the cottage with the medicine.

2. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - The guard, armed with a sword, takes action against the bandit after receiving the report from Tom. This eliminates the threat posed by the bandit, allowing Tom to proceed without fear of being robbed or attacked.

3. **The guard loots the bandit's sword from the corpse.**  
   - This action is necessary for the guard to arm himself further, ensuring he remains a strong presence against any future threats.

4. **The hero walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - With the bandit eliminated, Tom can now safely leave the market and head towards the crossroads, moving closer to his goal of reaching the cottage.

5. **The hero walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom reaches his destination, the cottage, carrying the medicine he purchased earlier.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is strategically chosen to ensure Tom can achieve his goal of reaching the cottage with the medicine. Reporting the bandit to the guard is crucial for eliminating the threat. The guard's subsequent actions ensure that Tom can safely navigate back to the cottage without the risk of encountering the bandit again.
