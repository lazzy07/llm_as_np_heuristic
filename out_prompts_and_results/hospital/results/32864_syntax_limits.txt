In this story, Young is in exam room B, and Hathaway is currently in the same room. Young wants to be alive and healthy, and the only way to achieve this is through proper treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if he assesses or treats Young. However, Young can take action to help ensure they receive the correct treatment.

1. **Assess Young**: Young can call out to Hathaway to assess them. This action is necessary because it allows Hathaway to determine if Young has any symptoms that indicate which disease they might have. Since Young is in exam room B, this action is valid and helps Hathaway understand Young's condition.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing, if Hathaway determines that Young has Flaze (fever), he can treat Young with antibiotics. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Young's health and aims to make them healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treatment, Young can walk to the admissions room to check on the status of the other patients, ensuring that they are also alive and healthy. This action is not strictly necessary for Young's health but aligns with their goal of wanting to be alive and healthy, as it shows concern for others.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Young)**: Young calls out to Hathaway to assess their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if they have Flaze or Jarkis.
2. **Treat(Young)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics after determining they have Flaze. This is essential for Young to become healthy.
3. **Walk(Young, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Young walks to the admissions room to check on the other patients, ensuring they are also healthy.
