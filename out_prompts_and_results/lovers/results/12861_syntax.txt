To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of being happy, which means they need to have the item they want (I1). Since Alex is already happy (as indicated in the current situation), we need to ensure that Casey and Blake also achieve their happiness.

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary for Casey to eventually get the item they want.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to have the item they want.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to give the item to Blake.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This is necessary for Blake to be happy, as Blake wants the jewelry.
5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to put down the jewelry. This is necessary for Blake to be able to trade items with Casey.
6. **put_down(C3, I2, R21)**: Blake puts down the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for the next action.
7. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the jewelry. This is necessary for Casey to have the item they want.
8. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to be happy.
9. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Alex is. This is necessary for Blake to give the item to Alex.
10. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I1) to Alex. This is necessary for Alex to be happy.

After these actions, all characters will be happy: 
- Alex has the chocolates (I1).
- Casey has the jewelry (I2).
- Blake has the flowers (I3).

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to ensure that characters move to the right locations to pick up or give items that align with their desires.
- The sequence ensures that Casey and Blake can achieve their happiness while also allowing Alex to maintain their happiness.
