To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, we need to ensure that she can safely acquire coins while avoiding any criminal activity. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Crossroads, and the Bandit is at the Market, having just attacked Tom. The Guard is also at the Market, which means the Bandit is in a precarious position.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will allow the Merchant to achieve her goal:

1. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit’s location to the Guard. This action is crucial because it brings the Guard's attention to the Bandit, who is a criminal. By doing this, the Merchant ensures that the Bandit is dealt with, which will allow her to operate without fear of being robbed or attacked.

2. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard walks to the Crossroads after being informed about the Bandit. This action is necessary for the Guard to confront the Bandit and remove the threat from the Market.

3. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard attacks the Bandit. This action is essential as it eliminates the Bandit, who poses a threat to the Merchant and allows the Merchant to safely conduct her business.

4. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Market)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant loots the coins from the Bandit’s corpse. This action directly contributes to the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without engaging in criminal activity herself.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks back to the Crossroads with the coins she looted. This action is necessary for her to return to her preferred location after successfully acquiring the coins.

By following these actions, the Merchant achieves her goal of obtaining coins without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **report**: This action is the Merchant's way of ensuring her safety and the removal of the Bandit threat.
- **walk**: The Guard needs to move to the Market to confront the Bandit.
- **attack**: This is the Guard's action to eliminate the Bandit, ensuring the Merchant can operate freely.
- **loot**: The Merchant takes advantage of the situation to acquire coins from the defeated Bandit.
- **walk**: The Merchant returns to her preferred location after successfully achieving her goal.
