To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also at the bank, and Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character with money, and Bubba's greed drives him to take it.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a necessary step since he is currently hungry.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can now decide to take the money from the clerk's body. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the clerk. This action completes Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger after committing the act.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's intention to take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
