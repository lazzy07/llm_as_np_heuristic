Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface, where it is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to take actions that will allow her to connect with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe.

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with it and potentially make friends. Although the surface is dangerous, she can quickly assess the situation and communicate with the Lizard.

2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, showing her intention to communicate and make peace rather than fight.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it establishes a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling her goal of making friends.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave together.** - This action ensures that both characters are safe from the erupting volcano on the surface. By moving to the cave, they can avoid danger and continue to build their friendship.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard share stories in the cave.** - This action solidifies their friendship and allows them to bond over their experiences, ensuring that both characters feel safe and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
