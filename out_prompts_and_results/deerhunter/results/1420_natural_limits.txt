After Bubba shoots Bambi, he realizes he is still hungry. He decides to eat Bambi, which is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to feel fulfilled. Since Bubba has no interest in money, he does not pursue the clerk or the money. The story ends with Bubba having eaten Bambi, which ensures Bambi is dead, and Bubba is no longer hungry.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba decides to eat Bambi (which is dead).
2. Bubba eats Bambi.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy that hunger.
- **Bubba eats Bambi:** This action confirms that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story that either Bubba has the money or Bambi is dead (in this case, Bambi is dead).

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["decide to eat", "eat"]
}
