Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to ensure that they are both safe and healthy, and that they can communicate without conflict. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to establish a relationship. The surface is dangerous, but Zoe believes she can handle it.

2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes peace.** - Since they are not fighting, Zoe can initiate a friendly interaction. This action is crucial for achieving her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** - This is the desired outcome of their interaction, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with another creature.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully navigates the dangers of the surface and establishes a friendship with the Lizard, ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.
