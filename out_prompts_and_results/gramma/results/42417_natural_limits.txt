The bandit, having just robbed the hero of their coin, decides to take advantage of the chaos at the market. She walks from the market to the crossroads, where she knows the guard is still at the market. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the hero's coin in her chest. 

This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. By moving to the crossroads and then back to the bandit camp, she ensures that she is not confronted by the guard and can secure her loot.
