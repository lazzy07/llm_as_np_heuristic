To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has two marriage proposals (one from Vince and one from Rory), she can accept one of them, which will make her happy. Additionally, Rory has treasure, which can contribute to Talia's wealth if she can acquire it.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action makes Talia happy because she is now in a relationship with Rory.
2. **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Talia takes the treasure from Rory. This action increases Talia's wealth, as she now possesses the treasure Rory had picked up.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her relationship with Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, as she needs to accept one of the proposals to fulfill her desire for happiness.
- **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to gain wealth by taking the treasure from Rory, which aligns with her goal of becoming wealthy.
