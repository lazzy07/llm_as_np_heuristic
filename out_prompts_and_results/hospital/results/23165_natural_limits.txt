Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to his fever. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Unfortunately, Ross actually has Jarkis, and the treatment fails, resulting in Ross's death.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is experiencing Unknown as well. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young also has Jarkis, leading to his death.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving his goal of having at least one patient healthy, despite the unfortunate outcomes for Ross and Young.
