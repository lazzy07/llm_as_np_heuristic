Bubba, having just shot Bambi, realizes he is still hungry and wants to have money. He decides to go to the bank to confront the clerk. 

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to get the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his desire to have money.)
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (This action is optional but allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger by consuming the dead deer.)

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money he wanted, and Bambi is confirmed dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money** is a direct action that fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Eating Bambi** is an additional action that satisfies Bubba's hunger, although it is not necessary for the primary goal of obtaining money.
