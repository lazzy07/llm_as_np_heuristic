Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs to eat something to satisfy his hunger. He spots Bambi in the forest and, with his rifle loaded, he takes aim. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his hunger by obtaining food.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to achieve his goal of eating.

At this point, Bubba has successfully satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi, and he has not interacted with the bank clerk or taken any money, as his primary goal was to eat.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
```
