To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or having Bambi dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to get money. He needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located to potentially steal the money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba goes back to the forest after realizing he cannot steal the money from the clerk without a loaded gun. This action is necessary to position himself for the next steps.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, now back in the forest, sees Bambi. He has a loaded rifle and decides to shoot Bambi. This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs food, and Bambi is a potential source of food.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain sustenance.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the clerk.

6. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Now that Bubba is in the bank, he can use his rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary to achieve the goal of Bubba having the money.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
