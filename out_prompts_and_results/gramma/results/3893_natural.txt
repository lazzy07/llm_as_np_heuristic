To achieve the guard's goal of killing criminals, the following actions will take place:

1. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant.** This action is necessary because the guard needs to inform the merchant about the bandit's presence, which could lead to further actions against the bandit.

2. **The guard walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the guard to confront the bandit directly, as the bandit is currently at the camp.

3. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.** This action is the culmination of the guard's goal, as it directly results in the death of a criminal.

After these actions, the guard has successfully achieved their goal of killing a criminal.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Reporting the bandit's location:** This action is crucial for the merchant to be aware of the threat and could potentially lead to a collaborative effort to deal with the bandit.
- **Walking to the bandit camp:** The guard must physically go to the location where the bandit is to confront and eliminate the threat.
- **Attacking the bandit:** This is the final action that fulfills the guard's objective of killing a criminal.
