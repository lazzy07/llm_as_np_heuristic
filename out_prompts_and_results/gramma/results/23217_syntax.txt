To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coin that Tom had. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to acquire coins to fulfill her goal.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is essential for securing her coins in a safe location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit robs the Merchant to gain a coin, which is crucial for her goal of accumulating wealth.
- The Bandit then takes the coin to the bandit camp, ensuring that her coins are safely stored, thus achieving her goal.
