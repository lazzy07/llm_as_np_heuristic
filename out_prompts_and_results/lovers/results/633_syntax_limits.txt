In the current situation, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Casey is currently in the same room as Alex and Blake, they can take action to get what they want.

1. **Action: trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)** - Casey can trade the jewelry (I3) they have with Blake for the chocolates (I2) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (I3) while also ensuring that Blake is happy with the chocolates (I2).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy.
- Alex will still be unhappy, but since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this action achieves the desired outcome.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire. It also indirectly supports Blake's happiness by allowing them to keep the chocolates.
