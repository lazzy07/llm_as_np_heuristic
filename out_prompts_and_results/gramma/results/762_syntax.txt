To ensure the guard achieves their goal of killing criminals, the following actions will take place:

1. **report(Tom, spot: Market, place: Bandit Camp)**: Tom, who is not a criminal, will report the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is necessary because it informs the guard about the presence of a criminal (the bandit) and allows the guard to take action.

2. **walk(Guard, Market, Bandit Camp)**: The guard will walk to the bandit camp based on the information provided by Tom. This action is essential for the guard to confront the bandit.

3. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: The guard will attack the bandit at the bandit camp. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills the guard's goal of killing a criminal.

After these actions, the guard successfully kills the bandit, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **walk**: The guard moves to the bandit camp to confront the bandit, which is necessary to carry out the attack.
- **attack**: The guard attacks the bandit, which is the final action needed to achieve the guard's goal of killing a criminal.
