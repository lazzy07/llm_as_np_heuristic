**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Ernest realizes he needs to ensure his safety and that of his friend Roy. He knows the bully is a threat, and he has the cigarettes that the bully wants. To protect himself and to avoid any confrontation, he decides to take a bold step. 

Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen, which he knows is a risky move but necessary for his survival. He then confronts the bully in the gym. With the knife in hand, he feels empowered and ready to defend himself. In a moment of desperation, he uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison. He quickly makes his way to the hallway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he had previously stolen. Disguised and free from the bully's threat, he heads to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison.
