The bandit, having successfully attacked the merchant and knowing that the guard is still at the market, decides to take advantage of the situation. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is present. 

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.** - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where the guard is, as the bandit wants to ensure that the guard is distracted or occupied.

2. **The bandit attacks the guard.** - The bandit is armed and believes that the guard is not armed. This action is crucial for the bandit to eliminate the guard, who poses a threat to her freedom and ability to carry coins.

3. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.** - After successfully attacking and killing the guard, the bandit can now take the guard's sword and any coins the guard may have had. This action helps the bandit to increase her wealth and ensure she has more weapons for future encounters.

4. **The bandit walks back to the crossroads.** - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can safely store her newly acquired items and coins.

5. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** - This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having as many coins as possible in her possession or stored safely.

By following these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
