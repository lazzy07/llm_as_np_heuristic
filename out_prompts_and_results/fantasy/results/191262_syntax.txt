To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she is engaged to both Rory and Vince. However, she can only marry one of them to achieve happiness. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia decides to marry Rory, as he has already accepted her proposal. This action will make both Talia and Rory happy.

3. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia follows Rory to the cave, wanting to support him and ensure their safety.
4. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, being hungry and wanting wealth, eats Rory. This action will leave Talia alone but still wealthy due to her treasure.
5. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia then takes the money from Vince, who is still in the village, ensuring she has both the treasure and the money, thus achieving her goal of wealth.
