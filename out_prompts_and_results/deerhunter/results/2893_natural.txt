To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, to ensure the story flows logically, we can include a few actions that reinforce his situation and conclude the story.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry, and this action satisfies his hunger.)
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (Bubba can eat Bambi since he has the rifle loaded, and Bambi is present in the forest. This action also reinforces Bubba's survival instincts.)
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the house.** (Bubba moves to a safe location after eating.)
4. **Bubba decides to keep the money.** (Bubba already has 1 money, and this action confirms his intention to retain it.)

Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, and the story concludes.
