To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - The guard is at the market and believes the bandit is at the crossroads. By reporting the bandit, the guard can take action against her, which is necessary for Tom to safely retrieve the medicine.

2. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - The guard is armed and can attack the bandit, who is also armed. This action eliminates the threat posed by the bandit, allowing Tom to proceed without danger.

3. **The hero loots the medicine from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - After the bandit is killed, Tom can loot the medicine from her corpse. This is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

4. **The hero walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom walks back to the cottage, now carrying the medicine, fulfilling his goal.
