**Story Completion:**

The bandit, believing that the hero, merchant, and guard are all at the market, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she sees the merchant holding the medicine. The bandit approaches the merchant and, since the merchant is armed but the bandit is also armed, she decides to attack the merchant. 

The bandit swiftly strikes the merchant down, killing her. After the merchant falls, the bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse. With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit returns to the crossroads, satisfied with her haul.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market:** This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where the merchant is, allowing her to attempt to achieve her goal of acquiring coins or items.
   
2. **Bandit attacks and kills the merchant:** The bandit needs to eliminate the merchant to take the medicine. Since both are armed, this action is justified as the bandit is willing to take the risk to achieve her goal.

3. **Bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the dead merchant:** After successfully killing the merchant, the bandit takes the medicine, which is a valuable item for her.

4. **Bandit walks back to the crossroads:** This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location with the medicine, completing her goal of acquiring valuable items.
