Bubba is at the bank, feeling hungry and wanting to have money. He has already stolen the rifle from the clerk at gunpoint, and he has 1 money. To achieve his goal of having 1 money, he needs to ensure that he can keep the money he has and not lose it to the clerk.

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and he needs to satisfy his hunger to focus on his goal of keeping the money.
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** - This action allows Bubba to leave the bank, where the clerk is present, and go to a location where he can eat without being disturbed.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - Since Bambi is alive in the forest, Bubba can choose to hunt and eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger and allows him to focus on his goal without distractions.

After these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and is in a safe location away from the clerk. He still has 1 money, which fulfills his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat.",
    "Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.",
    "Bubba eats Bambi."
  ]
}
``` 

This story is the shortest possible route for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger. Each action is necessary to ensure he can focus on his goal without the threat of the clerk or his hunger distracting him.
