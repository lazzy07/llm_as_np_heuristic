To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax is currently in the Village and needs to travel to the Cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Gargax to access the treasure.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Once Gargax arrives at the Cave, they will pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is already hungry, but this action is included to emphasize that Gargax's hunger is a concern that needs to be addressed after acquiring wealth.

4. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax will eat Vince, who is present in the Cave. This action will not only eliminate a competitor but also satisfy Gargax's hunger, as Gargax does not care about the happiness of others.

After these actions, Gargax will have the treasure, thus achieving their goal of being wealthy, and by eating Vince, Gargax will no longer be hungry.
