**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, and he has a plan to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison safely. 

Roy quickly moves to the laundry room to grab the knife. He knows that the knife is essential for his plan. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym. He knows that the bully is trapped inside, and this is his chance to confront him. 

Inside the gym, Roy finds the bully and, with the knife, he takes revenge by killing the bully. This action eliminates the threat that the bully posed to both him and Ernest.
