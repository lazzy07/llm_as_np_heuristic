To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will first assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is in a designated area for treatment.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine his symptoms and what treatment he requires.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room A. This is necessary to prepare for his treatment.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is already in Exam Room C. This is necessary to confirm his symptoms and treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

7. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
