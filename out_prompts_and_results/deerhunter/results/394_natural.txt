To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to go to the bank and take the money from the clerk, as the clerk has 1 money and Bubba has a loaded rifle.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to reach the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a means for Bubba to eliminate any threat and take the money without resistance.
- **Stealing the money** is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
