To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has the money but is not in the forest, so Bubba cannot steal it from the clerk directly. However, Bubba can use the rifle to shoot Bambi, which would allow him to eat and potentially fulfill his hunger.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate Bambi to either eat or gain something from the situation.
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, and it also allows Bubba to eat.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a part of his current needs.

After these actions, Bubba has successfully killed Bambi and can eat, which fulfills his hunger. The story ends with Bambi being dead, which is one of the required outcomes.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba needs to take action to achieve his goals, and shooting Bambi is a direct way to do that.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, making it a logical step after killing Bambi.
