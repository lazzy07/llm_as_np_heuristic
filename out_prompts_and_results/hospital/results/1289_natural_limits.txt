**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to admit Jones to Patient Room B, as he is experiencing a fever. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 1. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B and confirms that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. This reduces Hathaway's workload back to 0.
