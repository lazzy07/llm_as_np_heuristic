To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they may make a mistake if they assess a patient incorrectly. Therefore, we will first assess Ross, who is in exam room A, and then treat him based on the assessment. After that, we will assess and treat Jones and Young in their respective exam rooms.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.
2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is currently there. This is necessary to check on another patient.
4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.
5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate treatment. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.
6. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Young.
7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis.
8. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), Admissions)",
    "walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully assesses and treats all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
