In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but it is in the dining room (R22) where Alex is currently located. Casey (C3) is already happy because they have the chocolates (I3). Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the flowers (I2), which are in the bathroom (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the jewelry from the dining room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire and makes them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)** - Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room, which makes Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
- Blake remains unhappy because they still want the flowers.
- Casey remains happy with the chocolates.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the jewelry, which is the only item they want to achieve happiness.
