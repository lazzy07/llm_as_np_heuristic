Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, is at the bandit camp with the merchant. The merchant has the medicine that Tom wants to take back to the cottage. 

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to take action against the bandit, who is a criminal and poses a threat to his mission. He uses his sword to attack the bandit, who is at the crossroads. Since the bandit is not at the camp, Tom must first walk to the crossroads to confront her.

1. **Tom walks from the camp to the crossroads.** (This action is necessary for Tom to confront the bandit directly.)
2. **Tom attacks the bandit with the sword.** (This action is necessary to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit and secure the coins in the chest.)

After defeating the bandit, Tom can now safely return to the camp and retrieve the medicine from the merchant.

3. **Tom walks from the crossroads back to the camp.** (This action is necessary for Tom to return to the merchant and claim the medicine.)
4. **Tom takes the medicine from the merchant.** (This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage.)

Finally, Tom can walk back to the cottage with the medicine.

5. **Tom walks from the camp to the cottage.** (This action is necessary for Tom to complete his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.)

In summary, Tom successfully eliminates the bandit threat, retrieves the medicine, and returns to the cottage.
