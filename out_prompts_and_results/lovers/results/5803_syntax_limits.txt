In the current situation, Casey wants to be happy and is looking for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has picked up. To achieve this, Casey can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I3, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R12).

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy. Since Alex wants to make Casey happy, they willingly give the item they have.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have given away the item they were holding.
- Casey is happy because they received the jewelry they wanted.
- Blake remains unhappy, but the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
