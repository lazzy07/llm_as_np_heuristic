**Story Completion:**

The bandit, seeing the guard at the crossroads, decides to take action. She approaches the guard and, with her sword drawn, she attacks him. The guard, unarmed and caught off guard, falls to the ground, dead. The bandit then loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword. 

With the guard out of the way, the bandit walks to the market, where she finds the merchant. The bandit threatens the merchant with her sword, demanding the medicine. The merchant, fearing for her life, hands over the medicine to the bandit. 

Now armed with both the sword and the medicine, the bandit returns to her camp, satisfied with her haul of the hero's coin and the medicine.
