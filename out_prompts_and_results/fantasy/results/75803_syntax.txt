To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure located in the cave. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the cave with Talia, and Gargax can eat Rory to fulfill his hunger. This action also eliminates a potential threat to Gargax, as Rory is another character who desires wealth.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can now pick up the treasure that is located in the cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: This action is not necessary in this case since Gargax has already satisfied his hunger by eating Rory. Therefore, it will not be included in the final plan.

With these actions, Gargax will achieve both of his goals: he will be wealthy by acquiring the treasure and not hungry after eating Rory.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger by consuming Rory, who is a threat to Gargax's goal of wealth.
- **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, fulfilling his desire to be wealthy.
