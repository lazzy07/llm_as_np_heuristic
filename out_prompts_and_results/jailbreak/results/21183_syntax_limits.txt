**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest is feeling threatened by the bully, who is currently in the gym. Meanwhile, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. Knowing that the bully is a danger to both of them, Roy decides to take action.

Roy crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is. Once inside, he confronts the bully and, with the knife he found in the kitchen, he kills the bully. With the threat eliminated, Roy can now safely escape the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **vent(Roy, Gym)**: Roy uses the vents to access the gym where the bully is located. This is necessary for him to confront the bully without being seen or threatened in the hallway.
   
2. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: Roy kills the bully with the knife. This action is crucial as it removes the immediate threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.

With the bully dead, Roy can now escape the prison without fear of being threatened.
