In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I3) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the chocolates they want, thus making Alex happy.
