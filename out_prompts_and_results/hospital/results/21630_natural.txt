**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being 2. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition (Flaze). As a result, Jones does not become healthy and dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

Dr. Hathaway then walks from Admissions to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Since Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis again due to the workload being 2. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition (Flaze). As a result, Ross does not become healthy and dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway then walks from Admissions to Patient Room C to assess Young. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being 2. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition (Flaze). As a result, Young does not become healthy and dies.
