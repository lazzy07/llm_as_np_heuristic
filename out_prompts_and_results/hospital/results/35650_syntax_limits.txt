In this story, we will ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy by taking the necessary actions in the hospital setting. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. 

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room C**: Although this action does not directly affect Jones, it is necessary to ensure that Ross is also attended to, which helps maintain the overall health of the hospital environment. 

Now, let's outline the actions taken:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's condition.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: This action is essential to ensure Jones receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms, leading to his recovery.
3. **walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: This action helps to keep the hospital organized and ensures that all patients are being attended to.

By following these steps, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
