To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because it places Zoe in a dangerous situation where the volcano can erupt, fulfilling the requirement for the volcano to erupt and a character to die.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.**  
   - This event is triggered by the narrative and results in the danger of the surface becoming lethal, leading to a character's demise.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This is the consequence of the volcano erupting while Zoe is on the surface, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - The Lizard moves to the surface to check on Zoe, demonstrating concern and a desire to maintain their friendship.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.**  
   - Even though Zoe is dead, the Lizard's action of making peace symbolizes the friendship they had, ensuring that the story ends on a note of camaraderie despite the tragic outcome.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of Zoe, and the Lizard's continued friendship with her, even in her absence.
