In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Crossroads with a sword, while Tom is at the Bandit Camp with the Medicine. The Bandit is not currently located, but she is likely at the Bandit Camp, where she has coins in her chest.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Walk from Crossroads to Bandit Camp**: The Merchant can walk to the Bandit Camp to confront the Bandit and potentially rob her of the coins.

This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to reach the Bandit, who is likely carrying coins or has them in her chest. By walking to the Bandit Camp, the Merchant positions herself to take further actions that could lead to acquiring coins.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the action taken:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant walks to the Bandit Camp to confront the Bandit and attempt to acquire coins.

This single action is sufficient for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins, as it sets her up for a potential robbery in the next turn.
