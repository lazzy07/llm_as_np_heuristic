To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels from the cave to the village where the treasure is located. This is necessary because Gargax needs to be at the location of the treasure to acquire it.

2. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Talia, Village)**: Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's dead body. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy, as the treasure is the item that will fulfill this goal.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry after taking the treasure. This action is included to reflect Gargax's state, but it does not affect the outcome since Gargax's primary goal is wealth.

4. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax eats Rory, who is still alive in the village. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, ensuring they are not hungry after acquiring the treasure.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goals of being wealthy (by acquiring the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Rory).
