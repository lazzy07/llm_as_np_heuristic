In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (the chocolates), and currently, Alex has item I1 (the jewelry). Casey (C3) is already happy because they have item I3 (the chocolates). 

To achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy, Blake can trade their item I2 (the flowers) with Alex's item I1 (the jewelry). This will allow Alex to get the chocolates they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that Blake will take:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the flowers (I2) for the jewelry (I1) with Alex in the living room (R21). After this trade, Alex will have the flowers, which they do not want, but they will be able to get the chocolates from Casey, making them happy. Blake will also be happy because they have successfully helped Alex.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they will eventually get the chocolates.
- Blake (C2) will be happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
- Casey (C3) remains happy.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex an item that will lead to Alex's happiness. Since Alex wants the chocolates, this trade is a strategic move to facilitate that outcome.
