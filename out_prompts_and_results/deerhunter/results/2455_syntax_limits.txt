To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and is greedy, wanting money. The bank clerk is also present and has money. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat, fulfilling his hunger. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking care of his hunger after the robbery, but it is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal of having the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money after stealing it from the clerk, and Bambi is already confirmed dead from the previous actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **decide_to_eat**: This action shows Bubba's state of hunger and his decision to eat, which adds depth to his character but is not essential for the primary goal of acquiring the money.
