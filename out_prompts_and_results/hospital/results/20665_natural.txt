**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.
2. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is alive and in Patient Room B, assessing him will help identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis. Given that both diseases exist, this step is crucial to ensure the correct treatment is administered.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway determines that he has a rash, which is a symptom of Jarkis. Since the treatment for Jarkis is steroids, Dr. Hathaway administers the correct treatment. This action is essential for Ross to become healthy, thus achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
