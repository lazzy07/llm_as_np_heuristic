To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the treasure located in the cave, as it is the only item that can contribute to her wealth. Since Talia is currently at the cave, she can pick up the treasure. After that, we need to ensure that Talia's happiness is increased, which can be achieved through her marriage to Vince, who already has money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is the only item that can increase Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to go to the village to be with Vince, who has the money. This is essential for her to achieve happiness through their marriage.

3. **Talia proposes marriage to Vince.**  
   - Since Talia and Vince are already married, this action is not necessary. However, for the sake of clarity, we can assume that Talia reaffirms her commitment to Vince.

4. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action is also redundant since they are already married, but it reinforces their bond.

5. **Talia and Vince get married.**  
   - This action is unnecessary as they are already married, but it symbolizes their commitment and can be seen as a reaffirmation of their relationship.

6. **Talia's happiness increases.**  
   - This is the result of her reaffirmed marriage to Vince, which fulfills her desire for happiness.

At the end of these actions, Talia has picked up the treasure, traveled to the village, and reaffirmed her marriage to Vince, which makes her happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
