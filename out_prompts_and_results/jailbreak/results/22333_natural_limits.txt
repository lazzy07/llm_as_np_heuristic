Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. Knowing that Roy is in the gym with the bully, he decides to take a risk. He crawls through the vents to the gym, where he can lock the door behind him. Once inside, he finds the bully and, with the knife he previously left in the kitchen, he kills the bully. With the threat eliminated, Ernest can now safely escape with Roy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Crawl through the vents to the gym**: This action allows Ernest to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, maintaining his disguise and avoiding immediate confrontation.
2. **Lock the gym door**: By locking the door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape or call for help, making it a controlled environment for the next action.
3. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This action eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to be safe and free from the bully's intimidation.
