Meanwhile, the Lizard, safe in the cave, is also aware of Zoe's presence and the potential threat she poses to the planet.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's immediate safety from the erupting volcano. Although this action makes the Lizard angry, it is necessary for Zoe to avoid danger.

2. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard takes this action to confront Zoe and express its displeasure about her teleportation, but also to understand her intentions better.

In this sequence, Zoe's actions prioritize her safety while also allowing for the possibility of friendship with the Lizard. The Lizard's actions reflect its role as a guardian, seeking to understand Zoe's intentions.
