Hawkins stands on the island, treasure in hand, while Silver approaches him, eyeing the gleaming gold. Silver, believing that Hawkins has the treasure, demands to see it. Hawkins, confident in his deception, shows Silver the treasure but keeps it close, ensuring that Silver cannot take it from him. Silver, realizing he cannot take the treasure by force, decides to leave the island in search of more treasure elsewhere, believing that Hawkins will not be able to keep it for long.

In this story, Hawkins takes the action of showing Silver the treasure to maintain the illusion that he is willing to share or at least display it, which keeps Silver from becoming aggressive. By doing this, Hawkins secures his hold on the treasure without needing to engage in a conflict, allowing him to keep the treasure for himself.
