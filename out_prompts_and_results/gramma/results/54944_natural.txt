To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the hero and the guard at the market, where she can attempt to take the hero's coin.

2. **The bandit robs the hero.**  
   - The bandit, armed with her sword, can rob the hero, who is also at the market and is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin, which is crucial for her goal.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After successfully robbing the hero, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to either keep the coin or store it in the chest at the bandit camp.

4. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to engage with the hero and the guard, as this is where the action is taking place.
- By robbing the hero, the bandit gains the coin, which is a direct step towards her goal of accumulating wealth.
- Returning to the crossroads allows the bandit to safely store the coin in her chest, ensuring her goal is met without the risk of being caught by the guard.
