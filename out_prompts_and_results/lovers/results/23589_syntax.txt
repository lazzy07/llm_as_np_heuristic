To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included to show that Alex is returning to a familiar space after achieving their goal.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: This action allows Alex to reach the location where Blake and Casey are, enabling interaction.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that directly satisfies Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: While this action does not affect Alex's happiness, it shows Alex's return to a previous location after achieving their goal.
