In the cave, Gargax, feeling hungry and desiring wealth, notices the treasure lying nearby. Talia and Rory, both married to each other and unaware of Vince's fate, are preoccupied with their own thoughts. Gargax decides to take the treasure, fulfilling his desire for wealth and ensuring he is not hungry.

**Actions:**
1. Gargax takes the treasure from the cave. (This action allows Gargax to achieve his goal of becoming wealthy.)
2. Gargax eats Talia. (This action ensures Gargax is not hungry anymore, as he has now consumed a human.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary for Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth. By taking the treasure, he increases his wealth, which is one of his primary objectives.
- The second action addresses Gargax's hunger. By eating Talia, he ensures that he is no longer hungry, thus fulfilling his other goal.
