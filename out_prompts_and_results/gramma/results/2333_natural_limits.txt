Tom, having looted the medicine from the merchant, realizes he needs to get back to the cottage to use it. He knows the bandit is still at the market, and the guard is also present. To ensure his safety, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, who is eager to eliminate criminals. 

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is necessary because it helps Tom ensure that the bandit is dealt with, allowing him to leave the market safely without the threat of being attacked.

2. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.** This action is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

With the bandit distracted by the guard, Tom successfully makes his way to the cottage with the medicine.
