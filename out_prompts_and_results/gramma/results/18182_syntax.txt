To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The Bandit will walk to the Merchant at the Crossroads to attempt to rob her. This is necessary because the Merchant has the medicine, which the Bandit can use as leverage or distraction.

2. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Merchant)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the medicine. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain an item that could be valuable in negotiations or trades later.

3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads after robbing the Merchant. This is necessary to reposition herself for the next action.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp. This is essential for the Bandit to secure her loot and ensure she has the medicine in her possession.
