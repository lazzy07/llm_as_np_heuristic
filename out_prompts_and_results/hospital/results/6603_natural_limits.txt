Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Ross is actually healthy, he recovers from the unknown symptoms. 

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is still in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but with Hathaway's workload now at 1, he can accurately assess Young. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Young recovers from the unknown symptoms as well.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
