To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax is already in the cave, but to achieve their goal, they need to be in the village where the money is located. This action allows Gargax to move to the village.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: After arriving in the village, Gargax will eat Rory. This action is necessary because it allows Gargax to eliminate a potential threat (Rory) and also to satisfy their hunger. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, this action is purely for survival and wealth accumulation.

3. **take(Gargax, Money, Rory, Village)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money from Rory's dead body. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth, as it provides them with the money they desire.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring the money) and not hungry (by eating Rory). 

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Gargax travels to the Village**: Gargax needs to be in the village to access the money. 
2. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action satisfies Gargax's hunger and removes a competitor for wealth.
3. **Gargax takes the Money from Rory**: This action fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth.
