**Story Completion:**

After venting through the hallway, Ernest finds himself on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that he must escape before the bully or the guards can catch him. With the pack of cigarettes still in Roy's possession and the bully locked in the gym, Ernest feels a sense of urgency. 

Ernest takes a deep breath, glances back at the prison, and then makes his move. He steps onto the highway, blending in with the civilian attire, and begins to walk away from the prison, finally free.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: This action is crucial as it allows Ernest to leave the prison and achieve his goal of being alive and free. Since he is already disguised in civilian clothes, he can safely walk away without being recognized.
