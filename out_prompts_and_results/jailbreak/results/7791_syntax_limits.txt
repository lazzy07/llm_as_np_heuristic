**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the civilian clothes that can help him disguise himself for an escape. 

Roy quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he knows the bully is. Once inside, he locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten him or Ernest while they are trying to escape. 

With the gym door locked, Roy takes the knife he has hidden in the kitchen and uses it to kill the bully. This action eliminates the threat the bully poses to both him and Ernest. 

Now that the bully is dealt with, Roy can safely put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. He then crawls back through the vents to the hallway and makes his way to the highway. Once on the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself and successfully escapes from the prison.
