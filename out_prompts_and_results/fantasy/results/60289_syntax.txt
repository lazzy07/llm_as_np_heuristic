To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia is in the Cave where the Treasure is located. By picking up the Treasure, she increases her wealth, which is essential for her happiness.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the Treasure, Talia will travel back to the Village. This is necessary because she needs to be in the Village to interact with the other characters and solidify her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia will marry Rory in the Village. Since she has already accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia will also marry Vince in the Village. Since she has accepted Vince's proposal as well, this action will further enhance her happiness.

By completing these actions, Talia will achieve her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the Treasure).
