In the current situation, Alex (C1) is in the living room (R22) and wants the flowers (I1), which are currently with Casey (C3). Blake (C2) is also in the living room and wants the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Blake to give the chocolates to Alex. This action will not only make Alex happy but will also allow Blake to feel good about helping Alex, even though it doesn't directly fulfill Blake's own desire.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex in the living room. This action is necessary because it directly helps Alex achieve happiness by providing them with the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be:

- Alex will be happy because they have the chocolates.
- Blake will still be unhappy because they do not have the flowers.
- Casey will remain unhappy as well.

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills that requirement.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C2, I2, C1, R22)"]
}
