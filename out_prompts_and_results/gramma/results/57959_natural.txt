The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and looted the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. The guard, who is armed and present at the market, poses a threat to the bandit. To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit needs to eliminate the guard first.

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the guard is a threat to the bandit and could potentially stop her from achieving her goal. By attacking the guard, the bandit aims to kill him and remove the obstacle in her way.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's sword.** After successfully attacking and killing the guard, the bandit can now loot the guard's sword. This action is important because it not only gives the bandit an additional weapon but also allows her to be better prepared for any future confrontations.

3. **The bandit walks to the chest at the bandit camp.** With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now safely return to her camp. This action is crucial as it allows her to secure her coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest.** Finally, the bandit places the coins she has collected, including the hero's coin, into the chest at the bandit camp. This action completes her goal of having as many coins as possible secured in her camp.

The sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
