To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we can focus on the actions that will allow him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he is happy. The quickest way for Rory to achieve wealth is to obtain the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the story:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Rory to reach the treasure and fulfill his goal of becoming wealthy.

2. **Pickup Treasure**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

After these two actions, Rory will have achieved his goal of being happy (due to his marriage to Talia), wealthy (by picking up the treasure), and not hungry (as he is not in a state of hunger).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to go to the cave to access the treasure. This is essential for him to achieve his wealth.
- **Pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: By picking up the treasure, Rory directly increases his wealth, fulfilling his goal.
