Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his pack of cigarettes. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, so he takes advantage of this opportunity.

1. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: Ernest goes to the laundry room and puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner, which is essential for his escape plan.

2. **vent(Ernest, Highway)**: After disguising himself, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is necessary for him to escape the prison without being caught by the guards.

3. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Finally, once on the highway, Ernest successfully escapes from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free, away from the threats of the bully and the prison environment.

By taking these actions, Ernest ensures his safety and secures his pack of cigarettes, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
