Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, as they are not yet assigned to an exam room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can later assess and treat him. This also reduces the number of patients in the admissions room.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), this treatment will make Young healthy. This is a necessary action to achieve Dr. Hathaway's goal.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - This final assessment allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and can then treat Ross, ensuring that all patients are healthy.
