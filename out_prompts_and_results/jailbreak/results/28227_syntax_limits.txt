**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his goal of having a pack of cigarettes. He knows that Roy has stolen the bully's cigarettes, which puts both of them at risk. To protect himself and Roy, Ernest quickly moves to the hallway.

In the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door, preventing the bully from coming out and threatening them. This action ensures that they are safe from the bully's aggression for the time being.

Finally, Ernest makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
