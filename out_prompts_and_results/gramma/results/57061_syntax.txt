To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit then walks to the market, where the merchant is located. This is crucial because the merchant has coins that the bandit can rob.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs the merchant to take the coins she is carrying. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit walks back to the camp to secure the coins in her chest. This is important for the bandit to ensure her loot is safe.

5. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she successfully robs the merchant and secures the coins in her camp.
