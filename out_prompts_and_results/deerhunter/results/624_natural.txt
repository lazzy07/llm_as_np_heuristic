Bubba is at the bank, feeling hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk, who has the money he desires.

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to intimidate the clerk and steal the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now successfully steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted, and the story concludes.
