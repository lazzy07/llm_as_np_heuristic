Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and both are healthy but not safe. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate danger of the volcano.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - Although this action makes the Lizard angry, it is essential for Zoe to communicate her intentions and ensure the Lizard understands that she wants to help. This action also allows Zoe to be present with the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - This action is crucial as it leads both characters to a safer location away from the erupting surface. The cave provides shelter and safety from the volcanic activity.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - This action reaffirms their friendship and mutual understanding, ensuring that both characters feel safe and secure in each other's company.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
