The merchant, realizing the danger posed by the bandit, decides to take action to protect herself and her goods. She quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. The guard, upon receiving the information, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

Once the guard arrives at the crossroads, he sees the bandit and, armed with his sword, attacks and kills her. With the bandit defeated, the merchant feels safe and can now focus on her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal. She can now sell her medicine freely at the market, where she can earn coins from other customers.

This sequence of actions ensures that the merchant achieves her goal of getting as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal.
