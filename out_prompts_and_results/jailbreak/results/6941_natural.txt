**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, but he also knows he has to escape. He moves quickly through the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the gym. 

Once in the gym, he locks the door behind him, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. The bully, surprised and furious, confronts Ernest. However, Ernest has a plan. He pulls out the knife he had stolen earlier from the kitchen and confronts the bully. In a tense moment, Ernest manages to kill the bully, eliminating the threat once and for all.

With the bully dead, Ernest feels a rush of relief. He quickly leaves the gym, still in his civilian clothes, and heads back to the hallway. From there, he makes his way to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he takes off the disguise and blends in with the surroundings, successfully escaping from the prison.
