**Story Completion:**

As the tension in the gym escalates, the bully looms over both Ernest and Roy, threatening them with violence. Knowing they need to act quickly to survive, Roy decides to take a risk. He remembers that the knife is in the kitchen and that he can sneak out through the hallway.

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to escape the immediate threat of the bully in the gym.)
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the kitchen.** (This allows Roy to reach the kitchen without being seen by the bully.)
3. **Roy steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for Roy to defend himself and potentially get revenge on the bully.)
4. **Roy crawls back through the vents to the gym.** (This action brings Roy back to confront the bully with the knife.)
5. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that the confrontation is contained.)
6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action allows Roy to overcome the bully's threats and ensures his and Ernest's safety.)

With the bully dead, Roy turns to Ernest, who is still shaken but relieved. They both know they need to escape the prison. 

7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier.** (This disguises him for the escape.)
8. **Roy and Ernest move to the hallway.** (They need to get to the highway to escape.)
9. **Roy and Ernest crawl through the vents to the highway.** (This final action allows them to escape the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to either escape the bully's threats or to eliminate the threat entirely. The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that Roy can obtain the knife, confront the bully, and ultimately escape with Ernest. The locking of the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from retaliating or escaping, ensuring that Roy can safely kill him.
