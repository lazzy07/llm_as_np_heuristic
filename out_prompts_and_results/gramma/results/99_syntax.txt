To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant buys the medicine from Tom**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from Tom using one of the coins she has. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to gain an item of value (the medicine) while also ensuring she has a coin in her possession, which is crucial for her goal of acquiring more coins.

2. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads**: After the transaction, the Merchant will walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to position herself for future interactions, as the Crossroads is a central location connecting to other paths.

3. **Merchant walks to the Bandit Camp**: The Merchant will then walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary because it allows her to potentially interact with the Bandit, who may have coins.

4. **Merchant robs the Bandit**: The Merchant, now armed with a sword, will rob the Bandit. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to take coins from the Bandit without becoming a criminal herself, as she is armed and the Bandit is not.

5. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads**: After robbing the Bandit, the Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to return to a central location where she can further her goal.

6. **Merchant walks to the Market**: Finally, the Merchant will walk back to the Market. This action is necessary to finalize her transactions and ensure she is in a safe location where she can keep her coins.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant successfully acquires coins without engaging in criminal behavior.
