Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and both are healthy, but they are not safe. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, they need to act quickly.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting volcano. Although this action might make the Lizard feel abandoned, it is crucial for Zoe's safety.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** The Lizard needs to find a safe place as well. The cave is a safer location compared to the surface, especially with the volcano erupting.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** Zoe returns to the cave to join the Lizard. This action helps to reassure the Lizard that she values their friendship and is committed to their safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they both feel secure in their bond, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
