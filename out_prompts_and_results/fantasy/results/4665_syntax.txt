To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, who has proposed to her. Since Talia is currently in the cave and Rory is in the village, she needs to travel to the village to accept his proposal. After accepting, they can get married, which will make Talia happy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels from the cave to the village to be with Rory, who has proposed to her. This action is necessary for her to accept the proposal and achieve happiness.

2. **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Talia's happiness.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This final action ensures that Talia is happy, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Traveling to the Village**: Talia needs to be in the same location as Rory to accept his proposal. This is the first step towards her happiness.
- **Accepting the Proposal**: By accepting Rory's proposal, Talia takes a significant step towards achieving her goal of happiness.
- **Getting Married**: The marriage solidifies their relationship and guarantees Talia's happiness, which is her primary goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia becomes happy by the end of the story.
