To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure located in the cave while also addressing their hunger. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Talia is present in the cave, and Gargax can eat her. This action will also eliminate Talia, who is not focused on her hunger and is primarily seeking wealth and happiness.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: After eating Talia, Gargax can now pick up the treasure that is located in the cave. This action will fulfill Gargax's desire to be wealthy.

With these two actions, Gargax will achieve their goals of being wealthy (by acquiring the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Talia).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, they can eliminate Talia, who is a potential competitor for wealth.
- **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, fulfilling their goal of becoming wealthy.
