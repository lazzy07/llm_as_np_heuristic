To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will first assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Ross.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This will help determine his symptoms and the appropriate treatment.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room C, allowing for treatment.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is already in Exam Room A. This will confirm Young's symptoms and allow for treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms.

7. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross in Exam Room B with the correct treatment based on his symptoms.

8. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones in Exam Room C with the correct treatment based on his symptoms.
