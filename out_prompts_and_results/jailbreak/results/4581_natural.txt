**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to help Ernest and ensure their safety. He decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards while he plans his next move.

Next, Roy sneaks back through the vent to the hallway, ensuring he remains undetected. Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action is necessary to prevent the bully from threatening or harming Ernest while Roy executes his plan.

With the gym locked, Roy returns to the highway, where he can safely escape. He takes a moment to catch his breath, knowing that he has successfully protected Ernest from the bully's threats. Finally, Roy escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
