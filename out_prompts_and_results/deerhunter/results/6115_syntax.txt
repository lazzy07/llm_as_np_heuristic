To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has a rifle, and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is still alive and has no money, while Bambi is dead. Bubba is also hungry, which may influence his actions.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to return to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially get more money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal from the clerk. This action will allow him to take any money the clerk might have.
3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing, Bubba returns to the forest to ensure he is away from the bank and the clerk.
4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, which is a necessary action since he is hungry.
5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, the dead deer, satisfying his hunger.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, which is his primary goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing, Bubba needs to leave the bank to avoid any potential consequences.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Since Bubba is hungry, he needs to take action to eat.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger by consuming the dead deer.

By following this sequence, Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining money and satisfies his hunger.
