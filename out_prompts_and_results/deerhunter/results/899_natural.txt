To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is already at the bank and has a loaded rifle. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba is greedy and wants money, so he decides to steal from the clerk.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money. He is already hungry and has no money, so stealing is the quickest way to achieve his goal.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba obtaining 1 money, fulfilling his goal.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, and the story will conclude with him achieving his objective.
