The bandit, having just attacked the guard, realizes that the market is now vulnerable. She decides to take advantage of the situation. 

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market. This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant is located, as she needs to confront the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

2. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the medicine. This action allows the bandit to acquire an item of value, which she can later use to negotiate or trade for coins, thus fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

With these two actions, the bandit successfully moves closer to her goal of accumulating wealth.
