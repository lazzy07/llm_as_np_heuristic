In the village, Gargax, feeling increasingly hungry, decides to take action. He spots Talia, who is currently at the village. Gargax, driven by his desire to not be hungry, eats Talia. This action results in Talia's death, allowing Gargax to satisfy his hunger. 

With Talia dead, Rory and Vince, who are both married to Talia, are left in a state of despair. However, they realize that the treasure is still at the cave, and they can work together to retrieve it. They travel to the cave, where they pick up the treasure. 

Now, Rory and Vince can share the treasure with each other, which makes them both happy. However, Talia's happiness remains at 0 since she is no longer alive.
