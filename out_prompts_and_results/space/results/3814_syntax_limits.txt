Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety. Zoe, wanting to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both of their safety, decides to make peace with the Lizard. 

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the dangerous situation on the surface, rather than fighting or fleeing.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can now collaborate to find a safe place away from the erupting volcano, ensuring that both of them achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship.
