To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to give to Alex.

2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the living room (R21) to be with Casey and the jewelry. This is essential for Alex to receive the item they want.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making Alex happy.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the connection between the characters.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
