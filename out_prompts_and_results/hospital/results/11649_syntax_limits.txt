**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room A. Jones is currently in Patient Room B, and Young is in Patient Room C. Ross is still in the admissions room. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is showing symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway believes he has Flaze.
   
2. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also showing symptoms of Flaze, so Hathaway believes he has Flaze as well.

4. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy too.

At this point, Hathaway has treated both Jones and Young correctly, reducing their symptoms and achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
