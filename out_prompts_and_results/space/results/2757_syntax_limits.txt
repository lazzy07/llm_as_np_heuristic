In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard, while the Lizard also desires friendship and safety.

To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, a character dies, and the two characters make friends, the following action will be taken:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a necessary action to fulfill the condition of the story where a character dies. Since Zoe is on the surface, she will be caught in the eruption.

After the eruption, the Lizard, who is safe in the cave, will realize the danger Zoe faced and feel a sense of loss. This will lead to a change in the Lizard's perspective, allowing for the possibility of friendship in the future, even though Zoe has died.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the story's ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death. The eruption also serves as a catalyst for the Lizard to reflect on the importance of friendship and safety, potentially leading to a future reconciliation.
