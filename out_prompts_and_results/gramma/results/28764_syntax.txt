To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the TomCoin. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs coins to fulfill her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her stolen coins.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit uses her sword to rob the Merchant, taking the TomCoin. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without becoming a criminal, as the Merchant is not armed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp to deposit the stolen coin into the chest. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins by robbing the Merchant and then securing the coins in her camp.
