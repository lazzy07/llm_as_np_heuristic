Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take a bold step. He knows that the bully believes he is in the laundry room, so he uses this to his advantage. 

**Action:** Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym, where he knows the bully is locked in. 

**Explanation:** By crawling through the vents, Ernest avoids the bully's immediate threat and positions himself to confront the bully directly. This action is crucial because it allows him to bypass the hallway and the potential for being caught by the guards.

Once in the gym, Ernest uses the knife he stole earlier to confront the bully. 

**Action:** Ernest kills the bully with the knife.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully. By killing the bully, he ensures that both he and Roy are no longer in danger, allowing them to live without fear.

With the bully dead, Ernest can now safely return to Roy.

**Action:** Ernest goes back to the hallway.

**Explanation:** This action is taken to reunite with Roy and ensure they can plan their next steps together without the threat of the bully looming over them.

At this point, Ernest has achieved his goal of being alive and not threatened, and he still has the pack of cigarettes.
