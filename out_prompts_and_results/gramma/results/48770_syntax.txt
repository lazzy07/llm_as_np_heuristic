To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom needs to return to the cottage to fulfill his goal of being there. This action directly moves him to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because Tom's goal is to be at the cottage. Since he is currently at the crossroads, walking to the cottage is the only action needed to achieve his goal. He is already carrying the medicine, so there is no need for any other actions to acquire or defend items.

After this action, Tom will be at the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
