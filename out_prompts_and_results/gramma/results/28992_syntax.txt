To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market where Tom and the Merchant are located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to confront Tom to take the coins he has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has. This action is essential for the Bandit to increase her coin count, as she is currently at the Market and Tom is there with a coin.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This is necessary to return to her preferred location and to potentially store the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.
