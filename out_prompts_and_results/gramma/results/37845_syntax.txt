To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for her to move away from the scene of the conflict and avoid any potential danger from the Bandit or the dead Guard.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will also leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Bandit to escape the scene after attacking the Guard and to potentially regroup with the Merchant.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Merchant will then walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary for her to reach a safe location where she can store her coins and the sword she looted from the Guard.

4. **take(Merchant, GuardSword, Chest, Cottage)**: The Merchant will take the Guard's sword and place it in the chest at the Cottage. This action is necessary for her to secure the sword and ensure she has a weapon for future encounters, while also keeping her coins safe.

5. **take(Merchant, TomCoin, Chest, Cottage)**: The Merchant will take the coin from Tom and place it in the chest at the Cottage. This action is necessary for her to increase her coin count without being labeled a criminal, as she is now in a safe location.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired coins and a sword without engaging in criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant and Bandit both leave the Market to avoid further conflict and potential danger.
- The Merchant moves to the Cottage to secure her items and ensure her safety.
- Taking the sword and coins into the chest at the Cottage allows the Merchant to keep her items safe and increases her wealth without committing any crimes.
