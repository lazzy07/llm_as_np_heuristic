In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are present. Talia wants to be happy and wealthy, and she has already married both Rory and Vince. However, she currently has no wealth or treasure. Vince has the money, and the treasure is also in the cave.

To achieve her goal of being wealthy, Talia can take the following actions:

1. **Talia takes the money from Vince.** This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth, and since Vince has the money, taking it from him will fulfill her goal of being wealthy.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** This action is also necessary because the treasure is another form of wealth that Talia can acquire, further solidifying her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have both the money and the treasure, achieving her goal of being wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Talia takes the money from Vince:** This action directly increases Talia's wealth, which is her primary goal.
- **Talia picks up the treasure:** This action further increases Talia's wealth, ensuring she has achieved her goal.
