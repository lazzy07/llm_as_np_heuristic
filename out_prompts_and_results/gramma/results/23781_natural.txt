To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit needs to be at the market to potentially rob the merchant or acquire more coins.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant's coin from the merchant.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to take the coin that the merchant has, which is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. The merchant is not armed, making her vulnerable to robbery.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp with the stolen coin, ensuring she has coins in her possession.

4. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to be at the market, where she can potentially sell more items or acquire more coins.

5. **The merchant buys the medicine back from the bandit using the coin she has.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to regain the medicine she sold earlier, ensuring she has a valuable item to sell later, while also achieving her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

In this sequence, the merchant successfully acquires coins through the sale of the medicine and does not engage in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.
