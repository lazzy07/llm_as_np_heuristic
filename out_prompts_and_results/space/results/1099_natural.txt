To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can either become friends or that one of them dies, while also incorporating the eruption of the volcano. Given that both Zoe and the Lizard are currently at the surface and not fighting, we can have them take actions that lead to friendship, but we also need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will create a sense of urgency and danger.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action allows Zoe to seek safety from the erupting volcano, as the surface is dangerous. It also gives the Lizard a chance to follow her, which can lead to a potential friendship.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event creates immediate danger and urgency, forcing both characters to reconsider their relationship and actions.

3. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, which shows a willingness to be near her and can lead to a bond forming.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - In the cave, away from the danger of the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard can finally communicate and understand each other’s intentions, leading to friendship.

This sequence of actions ensures that the volcano erupts, creating a life-threatening situation that brings the characters together, ultimately leading to them making peace and becoming friends.

### Explanation of Actions:
