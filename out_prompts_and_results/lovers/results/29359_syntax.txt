To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to interact with Alex to achieve their goal.

2. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) they picked up earlier to Alex. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to receive an item they want, which is I1 (the chocolates), and it also helps Casey to get closer to their goal.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Blake and facilitate the next action.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I1) to Blake. This action is important because it allows Blake to receive an item they want, which is I2 (the jewelry), and it also helps Alex to be happy.

5. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the flowers (I3) they have with Alex for the jewelry (I2). This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal, as they will now have the flowers, which is the item they want.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have obtained the item they wanted (I3).
