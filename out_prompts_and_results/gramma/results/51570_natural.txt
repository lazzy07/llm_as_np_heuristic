The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. The merchant is dead, and the guard is still present but unaware of the bandit's criminal intentions. The bandit wants to maximize her coins, either by keeping the hero's coin or by ensuring that the coins in the chest at the bandit camp are safe.

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest, as she prefers to be at the bandit camp where she can safely store her loot.

2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having as many coins as she can, as she now has the hero's coin and the coins from the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
