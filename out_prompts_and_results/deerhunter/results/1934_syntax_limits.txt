To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: Bubba decides to return to the house to retrieve more ammunition, as he is hungry and may need to eat or defend himself. This action is necessary for Bubba to prepare for any potential confrontation or to ensure he has enough resources.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, House)**: After going to the house, Bubba picks up the money that he desires. This action directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.
