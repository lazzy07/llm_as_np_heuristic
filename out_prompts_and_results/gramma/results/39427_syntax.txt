To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move away from Tom and the Guard, who are both in the Market and could pose a threat.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Crossroads, the Bandit will take the coins from the BanditCoin location and move them to the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure the coins in a safe location, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to reach the location where the coins will be stored.

4. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the TomCoin from her inventory and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has as many coins as possible in her possession.

The sequence of actions allows the Bandit to successfully achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp without engaging in any conflict with Tom or the Guard.
