To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to maintain the flow of the story and allows for potential interactions with other characters.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) to check on Alex. This action is included to show that Casey is engaged in the story and is aware of Alex's location.

5. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room (R12) to follow Casey. This action keeps Blake involved in the story and allows for potential interactions.

6. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to Blake. This action is included to show that Alex is willing to share their happiness with Blake, which aligns with their goal of wanting Blake to be happy.

7. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R22) to return the flowers to Alex. This action is included to show Blake's intention to help Alex achieve their happiness.

8. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers back to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex has the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Alex moves to the dining room to access the flowers.
2. Alex picks up the flowers.
3. Alex moves back to the living room.
4. Casey moves to the dining room to check on Alex.
5. Blake follows Casey to the living room.
6. Alex gives the flowers to Blake, showing generosity.
7. Blake moves back to the dining room.
8. Blake gives the flowers back to Alex, ensuring Alex's happiness.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)",
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "give(C1, I1, C3, R12)",
    "move(C3, R12, R22)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
