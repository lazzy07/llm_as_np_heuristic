**Story Completion:**

After assessing Ross in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by SymptomA (fever). To ensure Ross's health, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for his symptoms. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address the situation with Young, who is still in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B, increasing their workload to 2 but allowing for further assessment and treatment.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B. Assuming Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway can then treat him accordingly.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Young also becomes healthy.

With both Ross and Young treated successfully, Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
