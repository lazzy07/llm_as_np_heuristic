To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact further.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she and the Lizard can make peace. This action signifies that they are no longer enemies and are willing to be friends, which aligns with both of their goals of making friends.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, the volcano erupts. This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: As the volcano erupts, the Lizard, who is on the surface, is killed by the eruption. This action results in the Lizard's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's death. This sequence of events aligns with the goals of both characters while also fulfilling the story's requirements.
