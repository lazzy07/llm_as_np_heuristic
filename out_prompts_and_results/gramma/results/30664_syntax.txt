To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the market, so she will walk to the crossroads to be in a position to take action against Tom, who is also at the crossroads.

2. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has. Since Tom is armed but does not have a sword, the bandit can successfully take the coin from him.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp and place the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to maximize her coins without drawing the attention of the guard, who is also at the market.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action moves the bandit to the crossroads where Tom is located, allowing her to interact with him.
- The second action allows the bandit to take a coin from Tom, increasing her wealth.
- The third action secures the coins in the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.
