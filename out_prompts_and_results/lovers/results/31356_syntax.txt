To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items later.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room. This allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating a potential trade or exchange of items.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to have an item to trade or give.

4. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I1) in the living room. This is crucial because Blake has the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to be with Casey. This is necessary for the next action where they can interact.

6. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) for the chocolates (I2) with Casey. This is essential because it allows Casey to have the item Blake wants while giving Blake the item Alex wants.

7. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
