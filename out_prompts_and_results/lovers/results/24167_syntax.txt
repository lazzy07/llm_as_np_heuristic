To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what they want, but they are not the focus of this story.
- Blake (C2) remains in the same situation, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, their happiness is not a priority.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want in exchange for the chocolates, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
