In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet, having established a peaceful relationship. However, the volcano on the surface is about to erupt, which poses a danger to both characters. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship to warn others about the impending eruption. This action, however, angers the Lizard, as it feels abandoned. 

To complete the story, we will have the volcano erupt after Zoe teleports back to the ship, resulting in the Lizard being killed. This action will also serve as a catalyst for Zoe to realize the importance of staying together and forming bonds with other creatures, even in dangerous situations.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to warn others about the volcano, which angers the Lizard.
2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, killing the Lizard.

This sequence leads to the Lizard's death while also highlighting the consequences of Zoe's decision to leave, ultimately emphasizing the importance of friendship and safety.
