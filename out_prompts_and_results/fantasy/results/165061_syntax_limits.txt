To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village where Vince is located. This is necessary because Rory needs to interact with Vince to obtain the money that Vince has.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial for Rory to become wealthy, as he currently has no money.

3. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger status is updated, as he needs to be aware of his hunger level.

4. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the Cave. This is necessary for Rory to be in the same location as Talia, who he is already in a relationship with.

5. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia. This action fulfills Rory's happiness requirement, as he is now in a happy relationship.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage), wealthy (by taking money from Vince), and not hungry (as he can now eat after the marriage).

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goals in the shortest possible manner while adhering to the constraints of the story.
