Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface, decides to teleport to the surface again to confront the Lizard. She believes that by showing her intentions to be friendly, she can change their relationship. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard and believes she can do this by being present on the surface.)
2. **Zoe walks towards the cave.** (Zoe wants to approach the Lizard to communicate and establish a friendship.)
3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (Zoe expresses her desire to be friends, and since they are not fighting, they can become friends.)
4. **The volcano erupts.** (As they are making peace, the volcano unexpectedly erupts, creating a dangerous situation.)
5. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** (Despite her intentions, the eruption leads to Zoe's demise.)

In this story, Zoe's actions are driven by her desire to make friends with the Lizard, but the eruption of the volcano ultimately leads to her death. The Lizard, while safe in the cave, witnesses the eruption and realizes the danger of the surface, which may lead to a future understanding of the need for cooperation.
