Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both needs. He has just stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and is now in a position of power. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk, eliminating the threat and ensuring he can take the money without any resistance. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money without interference.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his greed and allows him to achieve his goal of acquiring wealth.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully satisfies his greed and hunger, as he can now use the money to buy food later.
