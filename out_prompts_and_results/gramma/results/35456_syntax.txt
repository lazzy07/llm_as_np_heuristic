To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the coin from Tom's corpse. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is essential for her goal.

2. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the sword from the Merchant's corpse. This action is important because it gives the Bandit an additional weapon, which can be useful for future encounters or to defend herself.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her goal of having coins in her possession.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by looting the coins from Tom and the sword from the Merchant, and then taking the coins from the chest at her camp.
