She quickly loots the medicine from the hero's corpse, as it is an item that can be valuable for her. With the guard unaware of her actions, she successfully adds the medicine to her collection.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit loots the medicine from the hero's corpse: This action allows the bandit to acquire an item that could be useful for her or could potentially be sold for coins, thus helping her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
