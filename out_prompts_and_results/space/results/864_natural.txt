Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have just become friends, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety. Although it may anger the Lizard, Zoe needs to get to a safe location quickly to avoid the eruption.

2. **Zoe uses the spaceship to send a signal to the Lizard.** - This action is implied as Zoe communicates her intentions to the Lizard, ensuring that the Lizard knows she is not abandoning him but is instead trying to help.

3. **Zoe teleports back to the surface with supplies from the spaceship.** - Zoe returns to the surface with supplies that can help both her and the Lizard survive the eruption, demonstrating her commitment to their friendship and mutual safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave together.** - This action allows both characters to reach a safer location away from the erupting volcano, ensuring their health and safety.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** - This reinforces their friendship and solidifies their bond, ensuring that they can work together to stay safe.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
