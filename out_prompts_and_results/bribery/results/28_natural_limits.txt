In the bank, the villain, having just received the Money from the hero, turns to the President and attempts to bribe him with the Money to gain control over him. However, the President, who is not afraid of the villain, sees through the villain's intentions and refuses the bribe. Instead, the President decides to take a stand against the villain's manipulation.

Seeing the villain's failed attempt to control the President, the hero realizes that the villain's power is not as strong as it seemed. The hero, emboldened by the President's refusal, approaches the villain and threatens him, asserting that the hero will not allow the villain to use the Money for nefarious purposes. The villain, not fearing the hero, scoffs at the threat, but the hero's determination is clear.

In a surprising turn, the President, now aware of the villain's intentions, decides to support the hero. The President publicly denounces the villain's actions, stating that the Money should be used for the greater good. This unexpected alliance between the hero and the President weakens the villain's position.

Ultimately, the hero achieves their goal by ensuring that the Money is not used to control anyone, but rather to benefit the public. The villain, realizing they have lost their leverage, retreats, leaving the Money behind.
