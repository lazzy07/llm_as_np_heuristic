**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry room and kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway, holding the stolen pack of cigarettes. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he feels the weight of the threat hanging over both him and Ernest. 

To protect himself and Ernest, Roy decides to take a bold step. He sneaks through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently working out. With the knife he knows is in the kitchen, he has a chance to confront the bully. 

Once in the gym, Roy locks the door behind him, ensuring they are alone. He approaches the bully, who is caught off guard. In a swift motion, Roy pulls out the knife and kills the bully, finally overcoming the threat that has loomed over him and Ernest.
