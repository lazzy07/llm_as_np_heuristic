To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given that Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to get money, he will need to take actions that lead him to the bank where the clerk is located. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk, who has the money that Bubba wants.
2. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.** - This action prepares Bubba to potentially intimidate or threaten the clerk to get the money.
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Going to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money. Without this action, he cannot achieve his goal.
2. **Loading the rifle** is a strategic move that allows Bubba to assert control over the situation. It makes the clerk more likely to comply with Bubba's demands.
3. **Stealing the money** is the final action that directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, thus concluding the story with Bubba achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
