To achieve Vince's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to ensure he acquires the treasure and maintains his happiness. The following actions will lead to this outcome:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.** This action is necessary for Vince to become wealthy, as the treasure is located in the cave where he is currently situated.

2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** This action is needed for Vince to return to the village, where he can be with Talia and Rory, which will help him achieve happiness.

3. **Vince proposes to Talia.** Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant for the purpose of achieving happiness, but it reinforces their bond.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** This action will ensure that Vince's happiness increases, as Talia's acceptance signifies a positive relationship.

5. **Vince and Talia get married.** This action solidifies their relationship and contributes to Vince's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Vince picks up the treasure (to become wealthy).
2. Vince travels from the cave to the village (to be with Talia and Rory).
3. Vince proposes to Talia (to reinforce their bond).
4. Talia accepts Vince's proposal (to increase Vince's happiness).
5. Vince and Talia get married (to solidify their relationship and ensure Vince's happiness).

With these actions, Vince achieves his goal of being happy and wealthy.
