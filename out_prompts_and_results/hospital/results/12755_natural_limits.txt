Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high, decides to prioritize the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to reduce the number of patients in the admissions room and allows Hathaway to start assessing Ross's condition. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** Assuming Ross has the rash symptom of Jarkis, Hathaway administers steroids. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

After these actions, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully achieved their goal.
