To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Since Alex is currently not happy and is in the same room as the jewelry, the simplest action to take is for Alex to pick up the jewelry.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, which is the jewelry. As a result, Alex becomes happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Casey and Blake remain unhappy, but since the goal is to ensure Alex is happy, this action successfully achieves that.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
