To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is necessary because Casey wants to have the chocolates to potentially trade or give them to Blake.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake. This is necessary because Blake wants the chocolates (I2) to be happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the flowers. This is necessary for Blake to get the item that Alex wants.

6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the flowers. This is necessary because Blake needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to give the flowers to Alex. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex.

8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex is happy because they now have the flowers they wanted.

By following these actions, Alex achieves their goal of being happy.
