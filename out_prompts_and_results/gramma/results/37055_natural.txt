To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location where she can store her coins.

2. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the merchant's corpse.**  
   - Since the bandit has already robbed the hero of a coin, and the merchant is dead, the bandit can now take the hero's coin from the merchant's body, increasing her total coins.

3. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at her camp.

Now, the story is complete, and the bandit has successfully achieved her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows the bandit to return to her base of operations, the bandit camp, where she can safely store her loot.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the bandit to acquire the hero's coin, which she previously robbed from him, thus increasing her wealth.
- The final action secures her coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins stored safely.
