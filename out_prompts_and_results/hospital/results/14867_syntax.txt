To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where they can be assessed and treated. Since Young is currently in the admissions room, admitting them will allow Hathaway to address their symptoms.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: This action is crucial for Hathaway to determine the symptoms Young is exhibiting. Since Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis, this assessment will guide the treatment decision.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids in Exam Room C**: After assessing Young and confirming they have Jarkis, Hathaway can treat them with the appropriate medication (steroids). This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

4. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Ross is already in Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess him to confirm his symptoms. Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics in Exam Room A**: After confirming that Ross has Flaze, Hathaway can treat him with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway can assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. Jones has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze.

7. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics in Admissions**: After confirming that Jones has Flaze, Hathaway can treat him with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
