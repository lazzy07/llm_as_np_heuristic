Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to Hathaway's workload being 3, they mistakenly believe that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. This is a critical step because it allows Hathaway to gather information about Jones's condition, even if the assessment is flawed.

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis with steroids. Since Jones does not actually have Jarkis, this treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies. However, this action is necessary to reduce Hathaway's workload by one, allowing them to continue with the other patients.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess the remaining patients, Young and Ross, who are still waiting. This action is essential for Hathaway to continue their work and ensure that the remaining patients can be treated appropriately.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has reduced their workload and can now focus on the remaining patients, ensuring that they can be treated correctly.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones**: This action is necessary to determine the symptoms of the patient, even if it leads to a mistake due to the high workload.
- **Treating Jones**: This action is required to reduce the workload, even though it results in a negative outcome for Jones.
- **Walking to Admissions**: This action allows Hathaway to continue their work and assess the remaining patients, which is crucial for achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
