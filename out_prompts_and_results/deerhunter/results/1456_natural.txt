To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the bank and the clerk has 1 money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to be in a position to interact with the clerk directly.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which is his goal.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk**: This action is essential because Bubba needs to be close enough to the clerk to steal the money. Since they are both at the bank, this action is implied as Bubba is already in the same location as the clerk.
   
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money without any resistance from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go from the bank to the clerk",
    "steal the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal in the shortest and most efficient manner possible given the constraints of the story.
