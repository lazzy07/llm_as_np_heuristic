**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is still in the cells, threatened by the bully's anger over the stolen cigarettes. 

Roy decides to take advantage of the situation. He moves through the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he locks the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. The bully, unaware of Roy's presence, continues to work out, believing he is alone.

With the bully now locked in, Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously noted was left unattended. He confronts the bully, who is startled by Roy's sudden appearance. In a moment of desperation, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes and escape from the prison. He knows that Ernest will be safe now that the bully is no longer a threat.
