To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the same location (Cave) and is alive, making him a viable target for Gargax to eat. This action will fulfill Gargax's hunger.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: After eating Rory, Gargax will travel to the Village where Vince is located. Gargax will then take the money from Vince, who is alive and has the money. This action will increase Gargax's wealth.
