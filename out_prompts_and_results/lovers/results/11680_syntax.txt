To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) as well. This allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating a potential trade or exchange of items.

3. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey for the chocolates (I2). This is crucial because it allows Casey to have the item they want (chocolates) while giving Blake the item Alex wants (jewelry).

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
