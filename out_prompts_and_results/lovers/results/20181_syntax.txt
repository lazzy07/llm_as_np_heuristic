To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R12) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) has it. The goal is to get the jewelry from Casey to Alex.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want directly from Casey.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will be happy if they wanted the flowers, but since we are only focused on Alex's happiness, this is sufficient.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Alex to exchange the flowers for the jewelry, which is the item they want to achieve happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
