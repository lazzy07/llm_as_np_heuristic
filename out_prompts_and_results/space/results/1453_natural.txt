Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano on the surface. To ensure their safety and to foster a friendship, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to assess the situation on the surface and understand the threat of the volcano. 

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of Zoe's actions. The eruption poses a direct threat to Zoe, which will lead to a critical moment in the story.

3. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the cave.** - Zoe teleports back to the cave to escape the eruption. This action makes the Lizard angry, but it is essential for Zoe's survival.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard begin to fight.** - The anger from the Lizard leads to a fight, which is a natural escalation of their relationship given the circumstances.

5. **Zoe stuns the Lizard.** - Zoe stuns the Lizard to gain the upper hand in the fight, allowing her to communicate and potentially resolve their conflict.

6. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - After stunning the Lizard, Zoe takes the opportunity to talk and explain her intentions, leading to a peaceful resolution.

7. **The volcano finishes erupting.** - The eruption concludes, and since Zoe is safe in the cave, she survives, while the Lizard, who was on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies.

In this story, the actions taken by Zoe lead to her survival and the establishment of a friendship with the Lizard, despite the tragic outcome of the Lizard's demise due to the eruption. The sequence of actions illustrates the tension between survival and conflict, ultimately resulting in a bittersweet ending.
