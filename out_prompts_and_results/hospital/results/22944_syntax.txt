To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Jones, they need to walk to Admissions to assess Ross, who is currently there. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross. This action is necessary to get to Ross's location.

3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, so that the correct treatment can be administered.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway needs to return to Admissions to assess Young, who is also waiting there.

6. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Young.

7. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
