After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action fulfills his hunger and ensures that Bambi is dead. Since Bubba has already decided to get money, he can now go back to the bank to steal the money from the clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which satisfies his hunger and ensures that Bambi is dead.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes to the bank to steal the money from the clerk.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba being satisfied (having eaten) and also sets him up to steal the money from the bank clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.
