Zoe, realizing the danger of the volcano beginning to erupt on the surface, decides to take action. She teleports from the cave to the surface to confront the Lizard, hoping to make peace and work together to escape the impending eruption. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to be closer to the Lizard and address the situation directly.

Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard, who is still unaware of the imminent danger. She attempts to communicate and make peace, hoping to establish a friendship that could help both of them survive.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which allows them to become friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe and making friends.

As they are now friends, they can work together to escape the danger posed by the volcano. However, the volcano erupts suddenly, catching them off guard.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to a catastrophic event that results in the death of one character.

In this case, the story ends with the volcano erupting, and since Zoe is on the surface when it erupts, she dies. The Lizard, however, is safe in the cave, but the friendship they established remains significant.
