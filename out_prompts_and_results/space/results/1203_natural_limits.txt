Zoe, safe aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface is too dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She decides to make contact with the Lizard to establish a friendship, believing that cooperation could lead to a safer environment for both of them. 

To achieve this, Zoe teleports from the ship to the cave where the Lizard is located.
