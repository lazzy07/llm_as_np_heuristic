Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety from the erupting volcano. Since she is not fighting with the Lizard, this action does not anger the Lizard, and it allows her to regroup and think of a plan to help both of them.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to help the Lizard. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends now, and the urgency of the situation overrides any potential anger.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - They both move to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures both characters are safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - This action solidifies their friendship and mutual understanding, ensuring that they can work together to stay safe and healthy.

5. **The volcano finishes erupting.** - Since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event concludes the immediate danger.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
