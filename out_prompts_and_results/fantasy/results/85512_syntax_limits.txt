In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Given the current situation, Rory is already happy due to marrying Talia, but he needs to become wealthy and ensure he is not hungry. 

To achieve this, Rory can take the following actions:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory will travel to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for him to acquire wealth.
2. **Pickup the Treasure**: Once at the cave, Rory will pick up the treasure, which will make him wealthy.

These two actions will ensure that Rory achieves his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, as he will have the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the complete story:

Rory, feeling happy after marrying Talia, decides to travel to the cave to find treasure. He knows that acquiring wealth is essential for his happiness. Upon reaching the cave, he picks up the treasure, fulfilling his desire to be wealthy.

Now, Rory is happy (due to his marriage), wealthy (from the treasure), and not hungry (as he has not taken any actions that would make him hungry).
