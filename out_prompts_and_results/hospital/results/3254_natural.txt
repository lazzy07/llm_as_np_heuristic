**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing Fever, decides to treat him immediately. Since Jones is in Patient Room A, Hathaway administers antibiotics to treat the Flaze disease. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Jones's symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still experiencing Unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now below 3, there is no risk of making a mistake. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross also becomes healthy.

Finally, Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young. After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young also has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, making Young healthy as well.

By treating all three patients correctly, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
