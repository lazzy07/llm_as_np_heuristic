To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the Village to be with Rory and Vince, as she needs to interact with them to achieve her goals.

2. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince also travels back to the Village, which is necessary for the next actions involving marriage.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which will make her happy since she has accepted his proposal. This fulfills her happiness goal.

4. **take(Vince, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Vince takes the treasure from Gargax, who is in the Cave. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as Vince will then have the treasure.

5. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels back to the Cave to retrieve the treasure.

6. **give(Vince, Treasure, Talia, Cave)**: Vince gives the treasure to Talia, which will make her wealthy.
