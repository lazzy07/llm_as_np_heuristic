In the current situation, Casey (C3) wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I3). The only item that can make Casey happy is the jewelry, which is currently with Alex (C1). 

To achieve this goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Casey can trade the item they have (which is the flowers, I1) with Alex for the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

Here’s the completed story:

- **Action**: trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22) - Casey trades the flowers they have for the jewelry that Alex has. After this action, Casey is happy because they now possess the jewelry.

After this single action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still unhappy because they wanted chocolates (I2) and do not have them.
- Blake is also unhappy because they wanted flowers (I1) and do not have them.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry (I3).

This action is sufficient for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
