To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially receive the item they want.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy because they still do not have the chocolates (I2), but the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: This action allows Casey to enter the room where Alex is, facilitating the next action where Alex can give Casey the item they want.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: This action is the key to Casey's happiness, as it directly provides them with the item they desire.
