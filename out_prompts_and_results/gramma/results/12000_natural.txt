**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead on the ground and realizes that the hero is now vulnerable. She decides to take advantage of the situation. 

1. The bandit attacks the hero, killing him. (This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the hero, who is a potential threat and is not armed.)
2. The bandit loots the hero's body, taking the medicine and the hero's coin. (This action allows the bandit to acquire valuable items that help her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.)
3. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, carrying the medicine and the coins. (This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her loot in her safe location, the bandit camp.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit attacks the hero to eliminate a non-armed opponent and secure the medicine and coin.
- Looting the hero allows the bandit to fulfill her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
- Walking back to the bandit camp ensures that the bandit can safely store her acquired items.
