To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is currently in PatientRoomB, this action is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment. If Young has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, Hathaway will give steroids. This action is crucial to ensure that Young becomes healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Young**: This action is essential because Hathaway needs to know the symptoms of Young to provide the correct treatment. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot determine the appropriate course of action.
- **Treat Young**: This action is the culmination of the assessment. By treating Young with the correct medication, Hathaway can ensure that Young recovers, thus achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
