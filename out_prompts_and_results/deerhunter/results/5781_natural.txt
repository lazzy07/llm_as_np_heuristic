To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary as it aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle (the clerk) standing between him and the money.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
