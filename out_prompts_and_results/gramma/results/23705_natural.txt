To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a position to interact with the guard, who is at the market.

2. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant can help the guard eliminate the criminal threat, which aligns with her goal of not becoming a criminal herself.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the camp.**  
   - The guard needs to confront the bandit at the camp to deal with the criminal.

4. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action removes the bandit from the story, allowing the merchant to safely collect any coins without the threat of robbery.

5. **The merchant loots an item from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - The merchant can now take the hero's coin that the bandit had looted earlier, thus increasing her coin count.

6. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to return to a safe location after looting the bandit.

At the end of these actions, the merchant has successfully acquired the coins without engaging in criminal activity herself.
