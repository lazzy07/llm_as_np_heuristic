The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She knows that the guard is present and that the hero is also there, but she believes she can still achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. 

The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where she sees the hero and the merchant. The bandit then robs the hero, taking the hero's coin. With this action, the bandit successfully increases her coin count without directly confronting the guard, who is focused on maintaining order.

Now, the bandit has the hero's coin in addition to the coins in her chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where she can interact with the hero and the merchant.
2. **Bandit robs the hero**: This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.
