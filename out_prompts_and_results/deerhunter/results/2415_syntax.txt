To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to satisfy his hunger by eating, while also maintaining his greed for money. Since he is currently hungry and has just stolen a rifle, he will take actions that allow him to eat while also keeping his greed in check. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: Bubba decides to go back to the house to find food. This is necessary because he is hungry and needs to find something to eat.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: While in the forest, Bubba encounters Bambi. He picks up Bambi, which is an animal he can eat. This action is essential for Bubba to satisfy his hunger.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi. This action fulfills his hunger, which is one of his primary goals.

After these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger without compromising his greed for money, as he has not taken any further actions to acquire more money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: Bubba needs to move to a location where he can find food. The house is a logical choice since it may contain food or lead him to other options.
- **pickup(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Picking up Bambi allows Bubba to have food to eat. Since Bambi is alive, this action is a bit unconventional, but it serves the purpose of satisfying Bubba's hunger.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action directly addresses Bubba's hunger, allowing him to achieve his goal of eating.
