In this story, Zoe is on her spaceship while the Lizard is on the surface of the planet. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve this, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to confront the Lizard and try to establish a connection. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.

2. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to make peace. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, they can establish a friendship.

3. **Erupt (Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting, which will lead to a dramatic conclusion.

The sequence of actions leads to Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends just before the eruption, which adds a layer of poignancy to the story. The eruption signifies the danger of the planet, and while Zoe is safe on her ship, the Lizard, who is on the surface, will not survive.
