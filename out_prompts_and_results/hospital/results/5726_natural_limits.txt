Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, realizes that she needs to assess and treat the patients quickly to ensure their health. She decides to prioritize the patients in the exam rooms.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A.** This action is necessary to assess Ross, who is in Exam Room A. 
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.** This action allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will have to make a decision based on her current workload.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly impacts Ross's health.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B.** This action is necessary to assess Young, who is in Exam Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.** Similar to Ross, Young's symptoms are unknown, but Hathaway will need to make a decision based on her current workload.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. This action is crucial for Young's health.

After these actions, both Ross and Young are treated, and since they were treated with the wrong medications, they both die. However, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring the health of her patients is not achieved, as she made mistakes due to her high workload.

To achieve the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, Dr. Hathaway should have assessed each patient correctly and treated them with the appropriate medication.
