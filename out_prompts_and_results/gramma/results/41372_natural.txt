To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit walks from the camp to the crossroads. (This action is necessary to move towards the hero and the merchant's location.)
2. The bandit robs the hero of the medicine. (This action is necessary to take the medicine from the hero, as the bandit is armed and the hero is not.)
3. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the camp. (This action is necessary to return to the bandit camp with the stolen medicine.)
4. The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp. (This action is necessary to ensure that the bandit has the medicine secured in the chest, achieving the goal of having valuable items.)

The story is concise and focuses on the bandit's actions to achieve her goal without unnecessary interactions with the guard or the dead merchant.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "The bandit walks from the camp to the crossroads.",
    "The bandit robs the hero of the medicine.",
    "The bandit walks from the crossroads to the camp.",
    "The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential for the bandit to successfully achieve her goal of having valuable items in her possession.
