To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and obtaining the money, Bubba can then go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only character with money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money for himself, satisfying his greed.

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi, who is alive and in the forest, is killed and consumed by Bubba. This fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead, which is one of the two conditions for the story's ending.

The final sequence of actions leads to both outcomes: Bubba ends up with the money from the clerk, and Bambi is dead after being eaten.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively meets the story's requirements by ensuring that Bubba has the money and Bambi is dead.
