**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to admit Jones to Patient Room B, as he is experiencing Fever. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 1. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A, discovering that Young has a Rash. Since Young is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment. Young becomes healthy.

After treating Young, Hathaway's workload decreases to 0. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones, who is experiencing Fever. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C, as he is also experiencing Fever. However, since Hathaway's workload is now 1, he can only admit Ross but cannot assess or treat him in this turn.
