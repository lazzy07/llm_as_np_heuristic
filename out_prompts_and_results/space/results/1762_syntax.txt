To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation that forces both Zoe and the Lizard to act quickly to ensure their safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to escape the danger of the erupting volcano, prioritizing her safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, also seeking safety from the eruption.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can make peace, solidifying their friendship and ensuring that both characters are no longer in a fighting state.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.
