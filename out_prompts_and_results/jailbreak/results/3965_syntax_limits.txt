**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he needs to act quickly before the situation escalates.

1. **Action: Go (Ernest, Hall)**  
   Ernest moves from the kitchen to the hallway to get closer to the gym where Roy and the bully are located. This action is necessary to position himself for the next steps.

2. **Action: Lock_gym (Ernest, Hall)**  
   Once in the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door. This prevents the bully from leaving and ensures that he cannot threaten them further. Locking the gym is a strategic move to gain control over the situation.

3. **Action: Vent (Ernest, Hall, Gym)**  
   Ernest crawls through the vents to enter the gym. This allows him to surprise the bully and confront him directly without being seen entering through the main door.

4. **Action: Revenge (Ernest, Bully, Gym)**  
   Inside the gym, Ernest takes the opportunity to kill the bully with the knife he has. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to feel safe.
