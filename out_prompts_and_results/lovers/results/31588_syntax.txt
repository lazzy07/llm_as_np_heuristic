To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are. This is important for Casey to share their happiness with the others.

4. **give(C3, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to themselves (this is a way to signify that they have successfully obtained the item). This action confirms that Casey has the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **Moving to the dining room** is crucial for Casey to access the jewelry.
- **Picking up the jewelry** is the direct action that allows Casey to fulfill their desire.
- **Moving back to the living room** allows Casey to be with Alex and Blake, reinforcing the social aspect of happiness.
- **Giving the jewelry to themselves** is a symbolic action that confirms Casey's happiness.
