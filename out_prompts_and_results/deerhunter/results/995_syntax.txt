To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. Bambi is alive in the forest.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to eliminate the bank clerk to take all the money. This action is necessary to ensure that Bubba can take the money from the clerk without any resistance.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but can be included to show Bubba's next move after acquiring the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money after shooting the clerk, and Bambi remains alive since Bubba did not interact with her.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is a potential threat and has no money. It directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank after the clerk has been shot, fulfilling the goal of Bubba having money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is included to show Bubba's movement after achieving his goal, but it does not affect the outcome regarding Bambi's status.
