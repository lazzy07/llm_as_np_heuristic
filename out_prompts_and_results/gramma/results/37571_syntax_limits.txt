In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has just attacked the Merchant, who is now dead. The Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit can loot the Merchant's corpse to obtain the coins.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)** - The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the coins that Tom had just bought from the Merchant.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins without needing to go back to the bandit camp. By looting the Merchant, the Bandit can directly increase her wealth.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)"]
}
```
