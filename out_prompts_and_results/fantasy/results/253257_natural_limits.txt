In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to ensure that she has enough wealth and happiness. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, she can leverage her relationships to increase her wealth.

Here's the shortest story to achieve Talia's goal:

1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** (This action is necessary for Talia to confront Vince and Gargax, who are at the cave, and to negotiate for the money.)
2. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire the money to increase her wealth. Since Vince is alive, this action cannot happen, so we will assume that Vince is not dead, and Talia cannot take the money from him.)
3. **Gargax eats Talia.** (This action is necessary because Talia needs to be dead to take the money from Vince's body, which is a requirement for her to achieve her goal of wealth.)

However, since Talia cannot take the money from Vince while he is alive, we will adjust the story to ensure Talia achieves her goal without any contradictions.

Final Story:
1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** (Talia needs to be at the cave to interact with Vince and Gargax.)
2. **Gargax eats Talia.** (This action allows Talia to take the money from Vince's body, which is necessary for her to achieve her goal of wealth.)

In this scenario, Talia achieves her goal of being wealthy by acquiring the money after Gargax eats her.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Talia travels from the village to the cave.",
    "Gargax eats Talia."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible while ensuring Talia achieves her goal of being wealthy, albeit through an unconventional means.
