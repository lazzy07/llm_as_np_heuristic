To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reasons as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure all patients are treated.

6. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
