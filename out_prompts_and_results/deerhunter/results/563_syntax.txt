To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a loaded rifle. He is also greedy and wants money. Bambi is also in the forest, alive, and poses no immediate threat to Bubba. The bank clerk is at the bank, and while he has money, Bubba is not in a position to steal from him directly.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to consume food, which is a natural follow-up after killing an animal.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba decides to go to the bank. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where the money is.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba can steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action fulfills the condition of Bubba having the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba kills Bambi, which is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger and making use of the kill.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba travels to the bank to access the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk, achieving the goal of having money.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead.
