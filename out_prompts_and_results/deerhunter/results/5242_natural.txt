Bubba is currently at the forest, hungry, and wants to have money. The only way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to get money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has just shot Bambi, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger, which will allow him to focus on getting money afterward.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry and needs to eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to regain focus and energy to pursue his goal of getting money.
   
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and plan his next move.

3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: After eating, Bubba can now go to the bank where the clerk is located to attempt to get money.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Bubba decides to eat (to satisfy hunger).
2. Bubba eats Bambi (to fulfill hunger).
3. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank (to reach the clerk).
4. Bubba steals the money from the clerk (to achieve his goal of having money).

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

    "Bubba decides to eat",
    "Bubba eats Bambi",
