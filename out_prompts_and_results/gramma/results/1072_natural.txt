**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads. (The bandit wants to be near the merchant to potentially rob her.)
2. The bandit attacks the merchant, killing her. (The bandit is armed and can attack the merchant who is unarmed, allowing her to take the medicine and the hero's coin.)
3. The bandit loots the medicine and the hero's coin from the merchant's corpse. (This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins and obtaining valuable items.)
4. The bandit walks back to the bandit camp with the medicine and the coins. (This secures her items in her preferred location.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

- The bandit moves to the crossroads to confront the merchant, as she believes the merchant has the medicine and the hero's coin.
- The attack on the merchant is necessary for the bandit to take the items she desires, as the merchant is unarmed and cannot defend herself.
- Looting the merchant's corpse allows the bandit to fulfill her goal of acquiring coins and valuable items.
- Finally, returning to the bandit camp ensures that the bandit can safely store her newly acquired items.
