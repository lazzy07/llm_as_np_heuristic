To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia has proposed to Rory, and since Rory wants to be happy and wealthy, he will accept Talia's proposal. This action makes both Talia and Rory happy.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: After getting married, Talia will pick up the treasure located in the cave. This action will make Talia wealthy.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia will then travel back to the village with the treasure.

4. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Village)**: Since Vince is in the village with the money, he will keep it, but he does not care about being rich, so this action is not necessary for Talia's goal.

5. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action is already included in the accept action, so it is not repeated.

By following these actions, Talia will achieve her goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).
