In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has just looted the Medicine and Tom's Coin from the Merchant after attacking her. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit already has Tom's Coin, she can now take the coin to the bandit camp.

The Bandit will take the action to walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins in the chest.

**Action:**
1. walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp) - The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to store the coins she has looted.
