After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain some energy. However, he is still focused on his greed and the desire for money. 

Next, Bubba goes to the bank, where he knows the clerk is present. Since he is still greedy and has a loaded rifle, he decides to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba goes to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the clerk using his loaded rifle.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
