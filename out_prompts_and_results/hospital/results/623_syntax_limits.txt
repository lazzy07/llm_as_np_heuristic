### Story Completion

After admitting Jones to Exam Room A, Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to assess the next patient. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in the Admissions room. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B to ensure he receives proper attention.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room C. Young has not shown any symptoms yet, but Hathaway believes he is alive and healthy.

4. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway returns to Exam Room A to treat Jones. Since Jones has a fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics for Flaze, which is the correct treatment. Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway then treats Ross in Exam Room B. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young in Exam Room C. Young has not shown any symptoms, but Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

By the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
