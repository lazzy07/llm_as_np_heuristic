2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to achieve his goal of having 1 money, and the clerk has the money that Bubba desires.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action allows Bubba to take the money he wants, thus achieving his goal.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, fulfilling his desire.
