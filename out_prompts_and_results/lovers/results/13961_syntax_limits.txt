In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy, which means they need to have the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Action: move(C3, R21, R12)** - Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **Action: give(C2, I2, C3, R12)** - Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to receive an item, and it also helps Alex to feel happy since they want Casey to be happy.

3. **Action: move(C3, R12, R22)** - Casey moves to the bedroom (R22) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This is necessary for Casey to obtain the item they want.

4. **Action: pick_up(C3, I3, R22)** - Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the bedroom. This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of being happy.
