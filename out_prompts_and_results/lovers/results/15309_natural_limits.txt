In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy because they do not have the items they want. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Alex decides to take action. Since Blake currently has the flowers, Alex can simply ask Blake to give them the flowers. 

**Action:**
- Alex asks Blake to give the flowers to them.

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire to be happy by obtaining the flowers. Since Blake has the flowers and Alex has already expressed a desire for them, this action allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation changes:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is still unhappy because they do not have the jewelry.

However, the story's focus is on Alex achieving their goal.
