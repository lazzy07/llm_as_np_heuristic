**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones and Ross).

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess and treat him. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - Similarly, admitting Ross allows for his assessment and treatment. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is now in Patient Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Dr. Hathaway must make a decision based on the available diseases.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones actually has Jarkis, this would be a mistake, but it is necessary to attempt treatment.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross next, who is in Patient Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis (rash), Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. If Ross actually has Flaze, this would be a mistake, but it is necessary to attempt treatment.

10. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
    - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Young, who is still in the admissions room.

11. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.**  
    - This allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Young.

12. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.**  
    - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young.

13. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
    - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

14. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
    - Assuming Young has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics.

By the end of these actions, all patients have been assessed and treated, and Dr. Hathaway has done their best to ensure that all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat each patient, which is essential for achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
- The sequence of admitting, assessing, and treating is crucial to the workflow in a hospital setting, ensuring that no patient is left untreated.
