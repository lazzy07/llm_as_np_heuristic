**Story Completion:**

1. **Gargax eats Talia.**
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's body.**
3. **Gargax travels to the village.**

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. By eating Talia, Gargax also eliminates a competitor for the treasure, which aligns with Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.
   
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's body.** - After eating Talia, Gargax can take the treasure that was at the cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **Gargax travels to the village.** - Gargax travels to the village to potentially interact with Rory and Vince, who are still alive. This action is included to show Gargax's movement and the continuation of the story, but it does not directly affect Talia's happiness or wealth since she is no longer alive.
