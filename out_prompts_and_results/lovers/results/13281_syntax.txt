To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Since Alex is already happy with the jewelry (I1), Blake needs to ensure that Casey gets the chocolates (I2) to make Casey happy, as Casey is currently unhappy.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where Alex and Casey are located (R22) to facilitate communication and action.
2. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the same room (R22). This makes Casey happy.
3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Blake.
4. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the flowers (I3) with Casey for the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This makes Blake happy because they now have the item they want.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey to facilitate the next actions.
- **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: This action is crucial because it directly addresses Casey's unhappiness by giving them the item they want (chocolates), making Casey happy.
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action allows Casey to be with Blake, which is important for the next trade action.
- **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R21)**: This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want (flowers) while also ensuring Casey is happy with the chocolates.

After these actions, all characters are happy, and Blake has achieved their goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
