**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest realizes that he cannot stay in the kitchen with the cigarettes for long without facing the bully's wrath. He decides to take action to protect himself and Roy. 

1. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to defend himself against the bully.)
2. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This allows him to access the gym where the bully is located.)
3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, he prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him without interference.)
4. **Ernest confronts the bully in the gym with the knife.** (This is the moment of confrontation where Ernest can either defend himself or take revenge.)
5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, allowing Ernest to feel safe.)

At this point, Ernest has successfully dealt with the bully's threats. However, the noise of the confrontation attracts the attention of the guards.

6. **The guards arrive and confiscate the knife from Ernest.** (This action is necessary as it represents the consequences of the confrontation.)
7. **The guards punish Ernest by making him clean the gym.** (This is a consequence of his actions, but he is alive and no longer threatened by the bully.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at overcoming the immediate threat posed by the bully. By arming himself with the knife and confronting the bully, he ensures his survival and that of his friend Roy. Locking the gym door is a strategic move to prevent the bully from escaping and retaliating. The final confrontation leads to the bully's death, which resolves the threat. The guards' intervention serves as a narrative consequence, but it does not change the fact that Ernest has triumphed over the bully.
