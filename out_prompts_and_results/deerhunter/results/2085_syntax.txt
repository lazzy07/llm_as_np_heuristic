To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money rather than earn it through legitimate means.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry, so he decides to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank, which is a strategic move to ensure he can still access the clerk and the money he stole if needed.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer, which is a necessary action to fulfill his hunger. However, since Bambi is alive, this action cannot be completed unless Bambi is dead. Therefore, Bubba will not eat Bambi in this scenario.

The story concludes with Bubba successfully stealing the money from the clerk and escaping to the forest, where he can decide what to do next.
