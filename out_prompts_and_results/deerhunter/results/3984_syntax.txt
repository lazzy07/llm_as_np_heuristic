To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides a sense of closure to the story, showing Bubba moving away from the scene of the crime.

The actions are chosen to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money while also considering the possibility of Bambi being dead. However, since Bambi is in the forest and not directly involved in the bank scene, she remains alive in this scenario.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only person standing between him and the money he desires.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money after the clerk has been dealt with.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action serves to conclude the story, showing Bubba leaving the bank with the money.
