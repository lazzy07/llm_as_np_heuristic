**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B and Young to Patient Room C. 

1. **Action: Admit Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room so that Dr. Hathaway can assess him and provide treatment if needed. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 2.

2. **Action: Admit Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is also necessary to assign Young to an exam room, allowing for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

3. **Action: Assess Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the assessment is still necessary to determine the next steps.

4. **Action: Assess Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to evaluate his condition.

5. **Action: Assess Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. The same risk applies, but it is crucial to understand Young's condition.

6. **Action: Treat Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze due to the unknown symptoms and administers antibiotics. This treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

7. **Action: Treat Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and administers steroids. This treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies.

8. **Action: Treat Young for Flaze.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and administers antibiotics. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Despite the mistakes made due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is ultimately not achieved, as all patients die. However, the actions taken were necessary to attempt to fulfill the goal.
