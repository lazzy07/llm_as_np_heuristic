To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The simplest way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he already has a loaded rifle. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and since he has a loaded rifle, he can steal it.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**: This action is necessary because it sets the intention for Bubba to take the money, which is his goal.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**: This action is the execution of his intention and directly results in Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
