Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Dr. Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Since both are still in Admissions and have unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway can only admit them to the exam rooms. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A and Ross to Patient Room B. 

This sequence of actions ensures that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
