In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and wants to be wealthy. After eating Vince and Talia, Gargax is left in the village with Rory, who is still alive. Since Gargax is already in the village and Rory is also there, Gargax can take the money from Vince's dead body, which is the only item left that can help Gargax achieve wealth.
