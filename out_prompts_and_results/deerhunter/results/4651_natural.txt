To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but can be included to show Bubba leaving the bank after stealing.)
4. **Bubba counts his money.** (This action confirms that Bubba has successfully obtained the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal:** Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk has it. This action sets up the intention to take the money.
- **Steal the money:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money, as he uses the threat of the rifle to take it from the clerk.
- **Go to the house:** While not necessary for achieving the goal, it shows Bubba's movement after the theft, indicating he is no longer in the bank.
- **Count his money:** This confirms that Bubba has achieved his goal of having money.

### Final JSON Object:

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story. Bambi is already dead, so that condition is also satisfied.
