To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe recognizes that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and understands that making peace is essential for both of them to feel safe and healthy. By initiating peace, they can establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals as well.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe decides to walk back to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters can leave the cave safely, especially since the volcano is beginning to erupt.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard follows Zoe out of the cave. This action is important for the Lizard to stay safe and healthy, as it needs to leave the cave before the eruption becomes dangerous.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts after both characters have safely exited the cave. This action is included to show the danger that was present but was avoided by both characters due to their timely exit.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe, and they also establish a friendship.
