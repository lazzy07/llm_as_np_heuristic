To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and is greedy for money. The bank clerk has money, and Bambi is alive in the forest. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money at the moment.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank clerk. This action is essential as it fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving one of the specified endings.

### Explanation of Actions:
