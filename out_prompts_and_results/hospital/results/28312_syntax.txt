To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in Exam Room A, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Jones**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Jones. This is important because Jones is also a patient who needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is also in Admissions. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Jones based on his assessment. Again, the treatment will depend on whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients receive the necessary treatment.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
