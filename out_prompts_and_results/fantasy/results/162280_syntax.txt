2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the Treasure, Rory will travel back to the Village. This is necessary because Rory needs to be in the Village to interact with Vince, who has the Money.

3. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory will take the Money from Vince. This action is crucial because it allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of their primary goals.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory will become hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger status is addressed, as they want to be not hungry.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax, who is in the Village, will eat Rory. This action is included to create a dramatic conclusion to the story, as it leads to Rory's demise, but it is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story's ending.
