In this story, the merchant's goal is to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, and she prefers to be at the market. Given the current situation, the merchant is at the camp with the medicine and the hero's coin. The bandit is at the market, armed with two swords, and the guard is also at the market, armed and ready to kill criminals.

To achieve her goal, the merchant can take the following action:

1. **Walk from the camp to the market**: This action allows the merchant to return to the market where she can potentially sell her items or trade for more coins. 

This action is necessary because it places the merchant in her preferred location, where she can interact with the bandit and the guard, and potentially acquire more coins without becoming a criminal.

After this action, the merchant can negotiate or sell her medicine to the bandit or the guard, thus achieving her goal of acquiring more coins.
