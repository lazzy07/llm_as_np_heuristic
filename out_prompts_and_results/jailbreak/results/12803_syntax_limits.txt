**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, Ernest finds himself in a precarious situation in the gym with the bully. Knowing that the bully is a threat to both him and Roy, he decides to take action. 

1. **Revenge(Ernest, Bully, Gym)**: Ernest, feeling cornered and threatened, takes the knife he has hidden and confronts the bully in the gym. In a desperate move to protect himself and Roy, he kills the bully. This action is crucial as it eliminates the immediate threat to both of them, allowing them to breathe a little easier in the prison environment.

2. **Next_day()**: The day ends, and with the bully dead, the threat is neutralized. However, the consequences of Ernest's actions will unfold in the next day, leaving the outcome uncertain for him.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The action of revenge is necessary to ensure that Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened by the bully. It directly addresses their goal of wanting to be alive and not feeling threatened.
- The transition to the next day signifies the end of the immediate conflict, but it also leaves room for potential consequences, such as the prison guards discovering the bully's death.
