As Roy hides in the gym, he realizes that the bully is unaware of his presence. With the knife in hand and the cigarettes tucked away, he decides to take a bold step. He quietly approaches the bully, who is distracted and believes he is alone. In a swift motion, Roy plunges the knife into the bully, taking revenge for the threats made against him and Ernest. The bully collapses, and Roy quickly takes the pack of cigarettes from the bully's pocket, ensuring he now has what he desires. 

With the bully incapacitated, Roy knows he must act fast. He quickly leaves the gym, heading to the hallway. There, he puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself.
