Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both recognize the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface and decide to work together to ensure their safety. Zoe suggests that they should explore the cave further to find a safe place away from the volcano's threat. The Lizard agrees, and they both walk deeper into the cave, away from the surface.

As they explore, they discover a hidden chamber filled with glowing crystals that seem to pulse with energy. The Lizard explains that these crystals have healing properties and can help them both stay healthy. They decide to stay in the cave and protect each other, forming a strong bond of friendship.

However, unbeknownst to them, the volcano erupts violently, sending shockwaves through the planet. The cave begins to tremble, and rocks start to fall. In a moment of bravery, the Lizard pushes Zoe out of the way of a falling boulder, but in doing so, the Lizard is struck and fatally injured.
