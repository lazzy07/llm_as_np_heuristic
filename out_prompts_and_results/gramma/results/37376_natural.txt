The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and killed her, now stands at the market with the merchant's sword and the medicine. The guard, who is also at the market, is unaware of the bandit's criminal actions. The bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit has already attacked and killed the merchant, she can now loot the merchant's body for the medicine and any coins she might find.

1. **Loot the merchant's body**: The bandit takes the medicine from the merchant's corpse. This action is necessary for the bandit to gain valuable items that can be used or sold later.

2. **Walk to the bandit camp**: The bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she has acquired. This action is essential for the bandit to secure her loot and fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **Store the medicine and coins in the chest**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit places the medicine and any coins she has into the chest. This action ensures that she has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The final sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
