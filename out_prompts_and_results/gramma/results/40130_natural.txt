The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, now stands at the market with the merchant's sword in hand. The guard, also armed, is present and aware of the chaos that has unfolded. The banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit has already attacked and killed the hero and the merchant, she can now loot the items from their corpses.

2. **Loot the medicine from the merchant's corpse**: The bandit takes the medicine, which could be useful for future dealings or trades.
3. **Walk from the market to the bandit camp**: The bandit returns to her camp, where she can store her newly acquired items and coins.
