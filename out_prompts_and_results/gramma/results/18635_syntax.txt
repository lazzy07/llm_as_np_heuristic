To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The bandit will walk from the camp to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is at the market.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom of the coins he is carrying. Since Tom is not armed, the bandit can successfully take the coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit will then take the coins from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully collects coins without any interference from the guard or any other character.
