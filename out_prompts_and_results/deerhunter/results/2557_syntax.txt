To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk, as the clerk is the only character with money in this scenario.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, enters the bank with a loaded rifle.
- He sees the bank clerk and, in a moment of desperation, shoots the clerk to take the money.
- With the clerk incapacitated, Bubba picks up the money, fulfilling his goal.
