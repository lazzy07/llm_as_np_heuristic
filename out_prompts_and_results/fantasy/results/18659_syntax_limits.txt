To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia is already married to Rory, who also desires wealth, they can work together to secure the treasure. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her primary goals.

2. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax, the dragon, is already hungry, and since he is in the cave with Talia and Rory, he may pose a threat. However, this action is not necessary for Talia's happiness or wealth but sets the stage for potential conflict.

After Talia picks up the treasure, she becomes wealthy, which fulfills her goal of wanting to be wealthy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is crucial as it allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which directly increases her wealth. Since Talia's goal is to be wealthy, this action is essential for her to achieve that.
- **get_hungry(Gargax)**: While this action does not directly contribute to Talia's goals, it establishes the context of Gargax's hunger, which could lead to future conflict. However, it does not affect the immediate outcome of Talia's wealth.
