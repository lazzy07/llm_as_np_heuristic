In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, and they believe that Casey (C3) has it. However, Casey is currently unhappy because they want item I3 (flowers), which Alex has. To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, they need to ensure that Casey gets what they want while also obtaining the jewelry.

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I1) they received from Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that they currently have. This action allows both characters to achieve their goals: Alex gets the flowers they want, and Casey gets the jewelry they desire.

The actions are necessary because:
- The trade allows both characters to fulfill their desires simultaneously, ensuring that Alex becomes happy by obtaining the flowers they want while also making Casey happy by giving them the jewelry.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Alex achieving their goal of happiness.
