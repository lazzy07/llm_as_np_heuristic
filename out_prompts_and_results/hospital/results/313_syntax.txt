To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Ross's symptoms are currently unknown, and understanding them is crucial for proper treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Depending on the symptoms assessed, Hathaway will treat Ross accordingly. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential to ensure Ross's health, which indirectly supports Young's goal since all patients need to be healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in PatientRoomB to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms assessed. If Young has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.
