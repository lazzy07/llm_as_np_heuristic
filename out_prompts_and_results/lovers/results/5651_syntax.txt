To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential interactions with the other characters.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room. This action is included to show that Casey is aware of the situation and is moving to a location where they can interact with Alex.

5. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room. This action is included to show that Blake is also aware of the situation and is moving to a location where they can interact with Alex.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters can still interact, but their happiness is not the focus of this story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R21)",
    "move(C3, R12, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the dining room to pick up the flowers.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.
- **move(C1, R21, R12)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it allows for further character interactions.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)** and **move(C3, R12, R21)**: These actions show the other characters' awareness and involvement in the story, setting the stage for potential future interactions.
