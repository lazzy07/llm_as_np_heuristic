Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows he has the knife and the locked gym door gives him a moment of safety. He quickly approaches the bully, who is unaware of his intentions. With a swift motion, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Roy. 

Now that the bully is no longer a danger, Ernest can focus on escaping. He takes the civilian clothes he stole earlier and puts them on to disguise himself.

Once on the highway, he successfully escapes, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
