To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, successfully reaching his desired location while carrying the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. No other actions are needed since Tom already has the medicine after robbing the merchant.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the action explained:

Tom, having just acquired the medicine from the merchant at the Crossroads, decides to head to the cottage. He knows that the cottage is where he wants to be, and with the medicine in hand, he sets off on the path leading away from the Crossroads.
