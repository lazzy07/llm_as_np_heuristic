Zoe is at the surface of the planet, and the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, she needs to take the following actions:

1. **Teleport from the surface to the cave**: This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and find safety in the cave where the Lizard is located. Although this action might make the Lizard angry, it is essential for Zoe's immediate safety.

2. **Make peace with the Lizard**: Once Zoe is in the cave, she can initiate a peaceful interaction with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, this action can help them establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.
