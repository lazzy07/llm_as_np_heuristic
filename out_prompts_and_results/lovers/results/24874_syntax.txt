1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room (R22) with the jewelry. This action is included to show that Casey is back in the room with the other characters.

4. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to fulfill their goal of making Blake happy, as Alex is now happy with the jewelry.
