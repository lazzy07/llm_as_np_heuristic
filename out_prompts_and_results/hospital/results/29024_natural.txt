3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B. (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to be in the same room as Jones to assess his symptoms.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown. (This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition, even though it is currently unknown.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. (This action is necessary because Jones's symptoms are unknown, but since Jarkis is the only other disease, Dr. Hathaway will treat him for it to ensure he becomes healthy.)
6. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A. (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to treat Ross, who is in Patient Room A.)
7. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. (This action is necessary because Ross has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze, and he needs the correct treatment to become healthy.)
8. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C. (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to treat Young, who is in Patient Room C.)
9. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. (This action is necessary because Young's symptoms are unknown, and treating him for Jarkis ensures he becomes healthy.)
