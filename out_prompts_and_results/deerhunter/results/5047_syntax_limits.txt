After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain energy. However, he is still greedy and wants money. Since he has already shot Bambi, he can now go to the bank to steal money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to regain energy and continue with his plans.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

By completing these actions, Bubba satisfies his hunger and successfully steals money from the bank clerk.
