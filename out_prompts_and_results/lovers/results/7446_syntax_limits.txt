In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex is currently unhappy because they want item I3 (chocolates), and Casey is also unhappy because they want item I2 (flowers). 

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade item I3 (chocolates) with Casey for item I2 (flowers) in the living room (R22). This action will make both Blake and Casey happy, as Blake will receive the item they want (I2) and Casey will receive the item they want (I3).

After this trade, the happiness status will be:
- Blake will be happy because they have the item they want (I2).
- Casey will be happy because they have the item they want (I3).
- Alex will still be unhappy because they still do not have the item they want (I3).

However, since Blake's goal is to be happy and also to make Alex happy, this trade is the most efficient action to achieve Blake's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This action is necessary as it directly leads to Blake achieving their goal of happiness while also considering the happiness of others.
