To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Camp**: The Merchant needs to reach the Bandit to negotiate or potentially rob her for coins. 

2. **Merchant robs Bandit for coins**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, can rob the Bandit, who is not armed, and take coins from her. This action is crucial for the Merchant to gain coins without becoming a criminal, as she is not attacking but rather robbing.

3. **Merchant walks from Camp to Crossroads**: After acquiring the coins, the Merchant will return to the Crossroads to ensure she is in a safe location.

4. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Market**: The Merchant will then head to the Market to finalize her transactions and keep her coins safe.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without crossing the line into criminality.
