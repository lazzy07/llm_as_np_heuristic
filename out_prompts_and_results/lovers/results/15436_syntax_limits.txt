In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) has the flowers (I3). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Blake to trade the flowers for the jewelry with Casey. This way, Alex can receive the jewelry they want, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers (I3) they have with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to eventually get the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they will have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake will have the jewelry (I1) instead of the flowers (I3).
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) instead of the jewelry (I1).

Now, Alex is happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex receives the item they want (jewelry), thus making them happy.
