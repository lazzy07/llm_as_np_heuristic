To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to reach the crossroads, which is the only path to the cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom will walk to the cottage. This is the final step to achieve his goal of being at the cottage.

The actions taken are minimal and directly lead to Tom's goal without unnecessary interactions with other characters, as they do not contribute to his objective.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom leaves the market where he is currently located to head towards the crossroads, which is the only way to reach the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom arrives at the crossroads and continues on to the cottage, successfully reaching his destination.

At this point, Tom is at the cottage carrying the medicine, achieving his goal.
