Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms. Since her workload is at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she must act quickly to help the patients. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide her treatment decision. 

2. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway discovers that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. She treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it ensures Ross becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

By taking these two actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring he is healthy and contributing to her overall goal of patient wellness.
