To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is already married to both Vince and Rory, which means she can achieve happiness through her relationships. However, she is not wealthy yet. 

The treasure that Rory has picked up can be given to Talia to increase her wealth. Since Rory is at the cave with the treasure and Gargax is also there, we need to ensure that Gargax does not eat Rory before he can give the treasure to Talia. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary to eliminate Rory, who is currently the only character with the treasure. Gargax, being hungry and wanting wealth, will eat Rory to satisfy his hunger and potentially take the treasure.
   
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure from Rory's body. This action is necessary for Gargax to gain wealth.

3. **Gargax travels to the village**: Gargax will then travel to the village where Talia and Vince are located. This is necessary for Gargax to interact with Talia.

4. **Gargax gives the treasure to Talia**: Gargax, now at the village, can give the treasure to Talia. This action is crucial as it will make Talia wealthy.

5. **Talia becomes happy**: Since Talia is already married to both Vince and Rory, and now has the treasure, she will be happy due to her relationships and newfound wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- Gargax eats Rory: Necessary to eliminate the only character with the treasure.
- Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body: Necessary for Gargax to gain wealth.
- Gargax travels to the village: Necessary for Gargax to interact with Talia.
- Gargax gives the treasure to Talia: Necessary for Talia to become wealthy.
- Talia becomes happy: Achieved through her relationships and wealth.
