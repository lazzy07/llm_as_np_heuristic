Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, assesses Young and confirms that Young is experiencing a rash. Since Young has been admitted to Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway can treat Young for Jarkis, which is the correct treatment for the rash. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which successfully cures Young of Jarkis. Young is now healthy and has achieved their goal of being alive and healthy.
