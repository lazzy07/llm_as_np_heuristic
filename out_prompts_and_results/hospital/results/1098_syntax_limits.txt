**Story Completion:**

After walking from the admissions room to exam room A, Young finds themselves in the same room as Hathaway, who is currently managing two patients. Young decides to assess their own symptoms to help Hathaway understand their condition better.

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Young assesses their own symptoms, revealing that they have a fever, which indicates they might have Flaze. This action is crucial as it provides Hathaway with the necessary information to make an informed decision about treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is essential for Young to achieve their goal of being healthy.

With the treatment administered successfully, Young feels better and is now healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The assessment action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Young's condition accurately, especially since Hathaway's workload is at 2 and they could potentially make a mistake if they were to treat without proper assessment.
- The treatment action is critical as it directly leads to Young's recovery, fulfilling their goal of being alive and healthy.
