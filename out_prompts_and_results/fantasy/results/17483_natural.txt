To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, but she is not happy. To make Talia happy, we can have her accept one of the marriage proposals, as being married will increase her happiness.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** This action is necessary because it will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, accepting Vince's proposal will not change her marital status but will increase her happiness.

2. **Talia and Vince get married.** This action is redundant since they are already married, but it reinforces the commitment and ensures Talia's happiness is recognized.

3. **Gargax eats Vince.** Gargax is hungry and wants to eat a human. By eating Vince, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and since Vince is already married to Talia, this will not affect Talia's happiness directly but will remove Vince from the story.

4. **Talia's happiness increases.** With Vince gone, Talia's happiness is now solely dependent on her marriage to Rory, which remains intact. 

5. **Talia's wealth is confirmed.** Talia retains the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.

After these actions, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Rory and wealthy due to the treasure she possesses.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Talia accepts Vince's proposal",
    "Talia and Vince get married",
    "Gargax eats Vince"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Talia accepts Vince's proposal:** This action is crucial for Talia's happiness, as it solidifies her emotional connection with Vince.
- **Talia and Vince get married:** This action reinforces Talia's happiness, ensuring she feels fulfilled in her relationships.
- **Gargax eats Vince:** This action satisfies Gargax's hunger and removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her happiness and wealth without the complication of multiple marriages. 

By following this sequence, Talia achieves her goal of becoming happy and wealthy.
