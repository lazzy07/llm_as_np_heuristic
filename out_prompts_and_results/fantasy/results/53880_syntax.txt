To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax taking actions that lead to acquiring wealth while also addressing their hunger. The following sequence of actions will accomplish this:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for Gargax to access the treasure, which will help fulfill their goal of becoming wealthy.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry after picking up the treasure. This action is included to reflect the character's state, as Gargax's hunger needs to be addressed.

4. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince, who is the only remaining human in the village. This action not only eliminates a potential threat but also satisfies Gargax's hunger, allowing them to achieve their goal of not being hungry.

After these actions, Gargax will have the treasure, fulfilling their goal of being wealthy, and they will no longer be hungry after eating Vince.
