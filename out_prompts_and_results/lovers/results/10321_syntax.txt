To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential interactions with the other characters.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to check on Alex. This action is included to show the interaction between characters and their concern for each other's happiness.

5. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21) to see what is happening. This action further emphasizes the interconnectedness of the characters and their goals.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the flowers. The other characters can still interact, but Alex's goal has been achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "move(C2, R12, R21)",
    "move(C3, R12, R21)"
  ]
}
```
