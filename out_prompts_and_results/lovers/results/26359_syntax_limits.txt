In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (jewelry), and Blake currently has item I3 (chocolates). To achieve their goal, Blake can give Alex the chocolates, which will make Alex happy, and in turn, Blake will feel happy knowing that Alex is happy.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want (I1 - jewelry), and since Blake wants Alex to be happy, this fulfills Blake's goal as well.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex is happy with chocolates)
- happy(C2) = True (Blake is happy because Alex is happy)
- happy(C3) = False (Casey remains unhappy as they still lack their desired item)

This single action is sufficient for Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by ensuring Alex is happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C2, I3, C1, R22)"]
}
