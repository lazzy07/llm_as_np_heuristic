In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the story ends with the volcano erupting, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact and potentially become friends. 

2. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Once Zoe is in the cave with the Lizard, they can make peace, solidifying their friendship. 

3. **The volcano erupts**: Since the volcano has already begun to erupt, it will finish erupting, which will result in Zoe's death, as she is on the surface when it erupts.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of the volcano erupting and Zoe dying, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption.
