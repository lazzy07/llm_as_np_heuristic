Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where they can be assessed and treated. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.** This action allows Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones in Patient Room B to assess his symptoms.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** This is crucial to determine what symptoms Jones is experiencing, which will guide the treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** Assuming Jones has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment is appropriate. If Jones does not have Flaze, he will die, but since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, this is a necessary risk.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C for Jarkis.** Since Young is also in an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can treat him for Jarkis, assuming he has a rash. This action is also necessary to ensure Young's health.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
