Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money to satisfy his hunger. He knows the clerk has money at the bank, but he also sees Bambi in the forest. Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle, preparing to take action. He then decides to shoot Bambi, believing that if he kills her, he can eat her and satisfy his hunger. After shooting Bambi, he picks up her body to eat. With Bambi dead, Bubba now has food to eat, and he can also take the opportunity to go back to the bank to confront the clerk for the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle. (This is necessary for Bubba to be able to shoot Bambi.)
2. Bubba shoots Bambi. (This action fulfills Bubba's goal of having food to eat.)
3. Bubba decides to eat Bambi. (This satisfies Bubba's hunger.)
4. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank. (This allows Bubba to confront the clerk for money.)
5. Bubba steals the money from the clerk. (This action fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.)

In this story, Bubba ends up with both food and money, achieving his goals.
