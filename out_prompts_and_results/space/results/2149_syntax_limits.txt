In this story, we will have the volcano erupt, leading to a character's death, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends. 

1. **Erupt the volcano**: The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, realizes that the volcano is about to erupt and decides to take action to protect Zoe, who is currently on the spaceship. However, the Lizard also understands that the eruption is inevitable and that it will create a dangerous situation for both of them. 

2. **Make peace**: Before the eruption occurs, the Lizard and Zoe, who are both aware of the impending danger, decide to put aside their differences and become friends. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that they are united in facing the danger together.

3. **Erupt the volcano**: The volcano erupts, and since Zoe is on the spaceship, she is safe. However, the Lizard, who is on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies.

The actions taken are necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption occurs.
