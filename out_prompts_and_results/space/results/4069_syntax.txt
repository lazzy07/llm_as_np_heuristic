To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are not currently fighting, this action can succeed.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further their friendship and to ensure they are in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave, ensuring they are together in a safe place. This action reinforces their friendship and keeps both characters safe from the dangers of the surface.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts after both characters have moved to the cave, ensuring they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was present but is now avoided due to their previous actions.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
