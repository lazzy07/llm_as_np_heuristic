**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy realizes that he needs to ensure both his and Ernest's safety while also securing the pack of cigarettes. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he has locked the door to keep him contained. 

1. **Roy moves to the laundry room.** (He needs to do his chores, but also to access the civilian clothes.)
2. **Roy steals the civilian clothes from the laundry room.** (This will allow him to disguise himself later.)
3. **Roy goes back to the hallway.** (He needs to be in a position to escape.)
4. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, making it safer for him to move around.)
5. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This allows him to escape the prison without being seen.)
6. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise, he can leave without being caught.)
