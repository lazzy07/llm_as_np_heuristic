The story unfolds as follows:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Office to the Lobby. This action is necessary to position the Secret Agent closer to the exit and to ensure they are not in the same location as the Mastermind, who is presumed to be dead.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Courtyard)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Courtyard. This action is taken to create distance from the Office, where the Mastermind was killed, and to prepare for a potential escape.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Dropbox)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Courtyard to the Dropbox. This action is necessary to reach a location that allows for a potential exit from the scene.

4. **move(SecretAgent, Dropbox, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Dropbox back to the Headquarters. This action is taken to return to a safe location where they can regroup and plan their next steps.

At this point, the Secret Agent has successfully killed the Mastermind and is in a safe location, achieving their goal.
