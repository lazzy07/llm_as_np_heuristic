In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, but their relationship is currently strained. 

To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, Zoe will take the action to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and healthy. 

After making peace, the volcano will erupt, leading to the Lizard's demise, as it is on the surface and unable to escape in time. This fulfills the requirement of having a character die while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to have a moment of friendship before the eruption.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Zoe initiates a conversation with the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and understand each other better. This action is necessary to improve their relationship and ensure that they are not enemies.

2. **erupt(Surface)** - After making peace, the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death as it is on the surface and unable to escape.

The story ends with Zoe having made a friend, albeit briefly, before the eruption takes the Lizard's life.
