To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). Given the current situation, Casey is not happy because they do not have the chocolates, while Alex is happy with the jewelry (I1) and Blake is happy with the flowers (I3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room. This is essential as Blake needs to have the chocolates to give them to Casey.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Casey is located. This is necessary for Blake to be able to give the chocolates to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the chocolates, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the chocolates they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
