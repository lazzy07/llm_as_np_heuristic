With the disguise on, he feels a surge of confidence. He knows that if he can make it to the end of the highway, he can escape from the prison for good.

Roy takes a deep breath and starts walking down the highway, blending in with the civilian clothes. He keeps his head down, hoping to avoid any attention. After a tense few moments, he reaches the end of the highway and successfully escapes from the prison.
