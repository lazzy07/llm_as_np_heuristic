**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still low, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 2. Then, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is also experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway still has a manageable workload.

After assessing both patients, Dr. Hathaway realizes that both Jones and Ross are likely suffering from Flaze, as the symptoms are not clearly defined but could indicate a fever. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics in Patient Room A, successfully curing him. This reduces the workload back to 1.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics in Patient Room B, successfully curing him as well. The workload is now back to 0.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to check on Young. Young is still in Admissions, and Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, curing him as well.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.
