After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from his kill. 

Next, Bubba decides to go back to the bank. He knows that the bank clerk is still there and has money. Since he is no longer hungry, he can focus on his greed. 

Finally, Bubba decides to steal the money from the bank clerk. He uses the rifle to intimidate the clerk into handing over the money, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the clerk using the rifle.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of satisfying his hunger and acquiring money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
