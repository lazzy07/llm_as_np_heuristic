To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Currently, Alex (C1) is not happy, and they believe that Casey (C2) has the jewelry. The following actions will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry in the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included to show that Alex is now in a position to interact with others or to create a scenario where they can give or trade items later.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the other characters.

5. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn aligns with Alex's goal of being happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, and Casey will also be happy because they received the item they wanted.
