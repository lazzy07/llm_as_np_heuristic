Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous. By teleporting, she can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard needs to find a safe place away from the surface. The cave is a secure location where it can stay safe from the erupting volcano.

3. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - Zoe realizes that she needs to check on her friend, the Lizard, and ensure it is safe. This action shows her commitment to their friendship.

4. **Zoe walks to the cave.** - After teleporting back to the surface, Zoe walks to the cave to reunite with the Lizard. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to be together in a safe location.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action solidifies their bond and ensures that they will work together to stay safe.

6. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs naturally in the story, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also maintaining their friendship.
