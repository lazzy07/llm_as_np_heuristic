In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Market, having just attacked the Merchant. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Merchant is dead, the Bandit can loot the Merchant for the medicine and any coins she might have had.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the Merchant had. This action helps the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more valuable items.

After this action, the Bandit will have the medicine and any coins the Merchant had, thus achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
