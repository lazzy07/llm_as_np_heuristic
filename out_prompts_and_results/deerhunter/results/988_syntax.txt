To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba is at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money.
3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can return to the forest to ensure he is away from the bank and the clerk.
4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi, ensuring that she is dead.
