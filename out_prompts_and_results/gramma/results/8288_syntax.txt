To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit, who is armed, will rob the Merchant. This action is necessary because the Merchant has no coins and the Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible. The Bandit will take the coins from the Merchant, which will help the Bandit achieve her goal of having coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Bandit to move away from the Market and potentially to the Bandit Camp to secure her coins.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will then walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Merchant to follow the Bandit and potentially confront her or find another way to achieve her goal.

4. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit to the Guard. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to ensure that the Bandit is dealt with, thus preventing any further criminal activity and allowing the Merchant to feel safe in the Market.

5. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit. This action is necessary to eliminate the Bandit as a threat, ensuring that the Merchant can operate freely in the Market without fear of robbery.

6. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Market)**: After the Bandit is killed, the Merchant will loot the coins from the Bandit. This action is necessary for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant successfully acquires coins while ensuring that she does not engage in any criminal activity herself.
