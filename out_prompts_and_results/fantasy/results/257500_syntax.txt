To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to gain wealth and happiness while avoiding hunger. The following actions will be taken:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory needs to go to the cave where the treasure is located, as he currently has no wealth and needs to find a way to become wealthy.

2. **Pick up the Treasure**: Once Rory is in the cave, he can pick up the treasure, which will increase his wealth.

3. **Travel from Cave to Village**: After picking up the treasure, Rory will return to the village, where he can be with Talia and Vince.

4. **Propose to Talia**: Rory will propose to Talia, as he has already expressed his feelings for her, and this will help him achieve happiness.

5. **Accept the Proposal**: Talia will accept Rory's proposal, which will make both of them happy.

6. **Marry Talia**: Finally, Rory and Talia will get married, solidifying their relationship and ensuring Rory's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to go to the cave to find the treasure.
- **Pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Picking up the treasure will make Rory wealthy.

- **Accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts the proposal, making both happy.
- **Marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Their marriage ensures Rory's happiness.

Now, here is the final plan in JSON format:
