To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money from the clerk, as the clerk will no longer be alive to protect it.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money that the clerk had. This action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle between him and the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is shot, this action allows Bubba to collect the money, fulfilling his greed and achieving the story's goal.
