Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit nearby, also armed. Knowing that the bandit is a criminal and poses a threat, Tom decides to take action to ensure his safety and achieve his goal of getting to the cottage with the medicine.

Tom attacks the bandit with the sword, successfully killing her. This action is necessary because it eliminates the immediate threat posed by the bandit, allowing Tom to safely carry the medicine back to the cottage without fear of being robbed or attacked.

After defeating the bandit, Tom loots her body and finds the coins she had in her possession. This is an important step because it not only secures additional resources for Tom but also ensures that he is no longer considered a criminal, as he is now in possession of the medicine and has eliminated a criminal threat.

With the bandit defeated and the coins secured, Tom walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
