To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex is happy, which means Alex must have the item they want (I1, which is jewelry). Since Alex is already happy, we need to focus on making sure Casey and Blake are also happy, as they want different items. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake wants to be happy and needs to get the item they want.
   
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This action is necessary for Blake to have the item they want.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary to be in the same room as Alex and Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates to be happy.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room. This is not strictly necessary for the goal but helps to visualize the characters' movements.

6. **pick_up(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers. This is necessary for Casey to have an item they want.

7. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Blake. This is necessary for Blake to be happy.

At this point, Alex is already happy with the jewelry, Blake has the chocolates, and Casey has the flowers. All characters are happy, achieving the goal.
