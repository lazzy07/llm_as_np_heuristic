**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite her heavy workload, knows that Jones is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. She decides to treat him immediately to ensure he becomes healthy. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A for Flaze.** 
   - This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, and treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, she risks making a mistake, but she correctly identifies Jones's condition.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. She then turns her attention to Ross, who is still in the admissions room and has unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway will need to assess him to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C for Jarkis.**
   - This action is necessary because, after assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Treating him with steroids will make him healthy.

Now, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 1. She then turns her attention to Young, who is still in the admissions room.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway will need to assess him to provide the correct treatment.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B for Jarkis.**
   - This action is necessary because, after assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Treating him with steroids will make him healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can treat each patient based on their symptoms, which is crucial for their survival and health.
- The sequence of admitting, assessing, and treating is followed to ensure that the patients receive the correct treatment for their respective diseases.
