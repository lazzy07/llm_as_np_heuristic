To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Jones**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Admissions and assess Jones. This is important to identify Jones's symptoms as well, ensuring that both patients receive the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Admissions. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated appropriately.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Jones also becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, achieving the goal of making them healthy.
