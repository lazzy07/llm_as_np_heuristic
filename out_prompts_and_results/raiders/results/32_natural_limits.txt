**Story Completion:**

After returning to the USA with the Ark of the Covenant, Indiana Jones realizes the danger it poses. He knows that the U.S. Army is interested in the Ark for its power but is unaware of its true nature. To ensure the Ark does not fall into the wrong hands again, Indiana decides to take action.

1. **Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the U.S. Army.**  
   Indiana understands that the U.S. Army, being a powerful and organized force, can secure the Ark and prevent any future misuse. He believes that they will handle it responsibly, especially since they are unaware of its dangerous nature.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Giving the Ark to the U.S. Army** is crucial because it directly fulfills the goal of having the U.S. Army possess the Ark. Indiana's decision to give the Ark away ensures that it is no longer in his possession, thus preventing any potential misuse by himself or others. The U.S. Army, being alive and in the USA, is the only entity that can safely secure the Ark.
