To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest where Bambi is dead, and he has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is in the bank, and Bubba is greedy and hungry. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the rifle. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's greed and to acquire the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest. This action is necessary to ensure Bubba is back in a safe location after the theft.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, who is already dead. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and confirms that Bambi is dead.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and steal the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his greed by taking the clerk's money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba needs to return to the forest after the theft to ensure he is in a safe place.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action confirms Bambi is dead and satisfies Bubba's hunger.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money and Bambi is confirmed dead.
