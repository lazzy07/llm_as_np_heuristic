To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. Bambi is alive and in the forest with Bubba, but she does not have any money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - Bubba is hungry and wants money. Since Bambi is a deer, he can eat her if he kills her. This action also serves to eliminate Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action will result in Bambi being dead, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to get the money from the clerk.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of having money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his hunger and to eliminate Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
- **Shoot Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, fulfilling the condition of the story.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger after killing Bambi.
- **Go from the forest to the bank:** Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Steal the money from the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

The final sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.
