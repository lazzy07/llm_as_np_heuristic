To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has 1 money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal the money without resistance from the clerk.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Deciding to steal the money**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money. It sets the intention for the next action.
- **Stealing the money from the clerk**: This is the action that directly results in Bubba obtaining the money he desires. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money without any confrontation.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
