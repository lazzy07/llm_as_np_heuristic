In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (chocolates), and Blake currently has item I1 (flowers). Since Alex is unhappy and wants I3, Blake can give I1 to Alex, which will make Alex happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to receive an item, which is a step towards making Alex happy. 

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have received the flowers (I1) and now believes they have what they want (I3).
- Blake will also be happy because they have achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, achieving Blake's goal of making Alex happy with just one action.
