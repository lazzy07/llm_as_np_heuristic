To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is found to have the rash symptom (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated correctly.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room C and assesses Ross. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Ross has Jarkis or Flaze, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: After assessing Ross and confirming he has Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is essential for Ross's recovery, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway then returns to the admissions room to assess Jones. This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Jones are treated correctly, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomC, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

In this plan, "SymptomB" represents the rash indicating Jarkis, and "SymptomC" represents the unknown symptom for Jones, which Hathaway will assess to determine the appropriate treatment.
