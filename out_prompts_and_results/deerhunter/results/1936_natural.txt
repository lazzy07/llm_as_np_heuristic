To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling satisfied after his recent actions. He has successfully stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and shot Bambi, which has left him with 1 money. Bubba is hungry, but he knows he has enough money to satisfy his needs later. He decides to rest in the forest, content with what he has achieved.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba stands in the forest** - This establishes Bubba's current location and state of mind.
2. **Bubba feels satisfied** - This indicates that Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and does not need to take further actions.
3. **Bubba decides to rest** - This shows that Bubba is content and does not feel the need to pursue any more actions, as he has already achieved his goal.

Since Bubba already has 1 money, no further actions are necessary for him to achieve his goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": []
}
``` 

The plan is empty because Bubba has already achieved his goal and does not need to take any further actions.
