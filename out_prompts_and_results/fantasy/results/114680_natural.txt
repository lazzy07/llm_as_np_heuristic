To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human, and Rory is at the cave. By eating Rory, Gargax will fulfill their desire to not be hungry. 

2. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince has the money and is currently at the village. By traveling to the cave, he can join Talia and Gargax.

3. **Vince takes the treasure from the dead body of Rory**: After Gargax eats Rory, Rory will be dead. Vince can then take the treasure, which is at the cave, from Rory's body. This action allows Vince to become wealthy.

4. **Vince gives the money to Talia**: Vince has the money and can give it to Talia, which will make Talia happy. This action is not directly related to Rory's goal but helps maintain the relationships and dynamics in the story.

5. **Talia proposes to Vince**: Talia, now happy from receiving the money, can propose to Vince, which will further solidify their relationship.

6. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal**: Vince accepts Talia's proposal, making both of them happy.

7. **Talia and Vince get married**: This final action ensures that both Talia and Vince are happy, and it also indirectly supports Rory's goal by maintaining a positive atmosphere.

In this story, Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry through the actions of Gargax, Vince, and Talia, even though Rory's fate is sealed by Gargax's action.
