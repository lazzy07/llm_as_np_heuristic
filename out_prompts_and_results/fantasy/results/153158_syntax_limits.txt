In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She has already accepted Vince's marriage proposal, which makes her happy, and she has picked up the treasure, which contributes to her wealth. The only thing left for Talia to do is to ensure she has money, as she currently does not possess any.

To achieve her goal, Talia can take the money from Vince, who is currently at the cave with her. This action will allow her to become wealthy, as she will then have both the treasure and the money.
