2. With the merchant dead, the bandit now has the medicine and the coin, which fulfills her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. The guard, who is at the market, is alerted by the commotion at the crossroads. He walks to the crossroads to investigate.

4. Upon arriving at the crossroads, the guard sees the bandit standing over the merchant's corpse. The guard, believing the bandit to be a criminal, attacks and kills her, looting her sword afterward.
