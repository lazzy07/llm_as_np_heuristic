In this story, we will ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients and achieves their goal of making them healthy. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. Since we have not established Ross's symptoms yet, we will assume he has the same symptoms as Jones (SymptomA), which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated correctly.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. Assuming Young also has the same symptoms as Jones (SymptomA), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, ensuring they are healthy.
