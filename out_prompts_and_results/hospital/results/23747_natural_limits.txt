Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, assesses Jones, who is experiencing Fever. Recognizing the symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. 

Next, Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room A. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to assess him next. 

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway treats Jones correctly, achieving the goal of making at least one patient healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's condition (Flaze) and leads to his recovery.
