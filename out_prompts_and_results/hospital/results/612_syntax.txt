To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Jones, if he is found to have Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is essential for Jones to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Since the story only requires Jones to be healthy, and the actions taken are the minimum necessary to achieve that, no further actions are needed for Ross and Young.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Jones is assessed and treated correctly, leading to his recovery and fulfillment of his goal.
