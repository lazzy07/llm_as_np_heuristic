To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3)**: This action is necessary for Alex to understand what Casey desires, which is crucial for the next steps.
   - Action: `tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)`

2. **Alex picks up the jewelry (I1)**: Since Alex is in the same room (R22) and wants to help Casey, they will pick up the jewelry.
   - Action: `pick_up(C1, I1, R22)`

3. **Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey**: Alex, wanting to make Casey happy, will give them the jewelry they just picked up.
   - Action: `give(C1, I1, C3, R22)`

4. **Casey is now happy**: After receiving the jewelry, Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- **Action 1**: Casey tells Alex they want the jewelry, which sets the stage for Alex to act.
- **Action 2**: Alex picks up the jewelry, which is necessary for them to give it to Casey.
- **Action 3**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.
