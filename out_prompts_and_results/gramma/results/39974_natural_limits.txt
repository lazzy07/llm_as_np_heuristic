The bandit, having just attacked and killed the hero at the crossroads, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard and the merchant are at the market, unaware of her actions. The bandit quickly loots the hero's corpse, taking the hero's coin. With this coin, she now has a total of two coins: one in her possession and one in the chest at the bandit camp. 

Now, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins. With her goal of carrying as many coins as possible achieved, she feels satisfied.

1. **Loot the hero's corpse**: This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin, which contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
2. **Walk from the crossroads to the bandit camp**: This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her coins.
