To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey wants to be happy and needs to be in a position to interact with the items.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Blake wants to help Alex and needs to be in the same room to facilitate the exchange of items.

3. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey for the chocolates (I2). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to have the item they want while giving Alex the jewelry they desire.

4. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to be in a position to give the jewelry to Alex.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex achieves their goal of being happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, making them happy.
