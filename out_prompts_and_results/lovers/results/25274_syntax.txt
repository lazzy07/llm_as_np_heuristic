To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Casey is currently unhappy and in the same room as Blake, who is also unhappy, we can facilitate a trade between them to achieve this.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, which will make them happy.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is happy with the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is now happy with the jewelry (I3).
- Casey (C3) is now happy with the chocolates (I2).

This sequence of actions directly leads to Casey achieving their goal of happiness.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey gets the jewelry they want, thus making them happy.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
