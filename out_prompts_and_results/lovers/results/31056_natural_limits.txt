In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all trying to figure out how to achieve their happiness. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey also wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Alex decides to take action. Since Blake is holding the jewelry, Alex can simply ask Blake to give it to them. 

**Action: Alex tells Blake to give the jewelry to them.**

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's goal of obtaining the jewelry. By asking Blake to give it to them, Alex can achieve happiness without needing to navigate through other rooms or items.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is still unhappy because they do not have the jewelry.

However, the story's focus is on Alex achieving their goal.
