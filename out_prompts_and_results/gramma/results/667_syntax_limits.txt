To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the market and needs to move towards the cottage. The crossroads is the only path leading to the cottage, so he walks there.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom continues on the path to the cottage, where he can finally achieve his goal of being there with the medicine.

This sequence of actions is the shortest possible way for Tom to reach the cottage with the medicine, as he cannot perform any other actions that would help him achieve his goal without first moving to the crossroads.
