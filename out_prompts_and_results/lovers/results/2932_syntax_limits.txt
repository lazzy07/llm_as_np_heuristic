In the current situation, Casey (C3) is unhappy because they want the jewelry (I3), which is currently in the living room (R22). Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1), but Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R12).

To help Casey achieve their goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Casey can trade the jewelry (I3) with Blake for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

Here’s how the story unfolds:

- **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry they have (which is in their possession) with Blake for the chocolates. This action is performed in the living room (R22), where both characters are present. After this trade, Casey will have the chocolates, which they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is now happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake is now unhappy because they have given away the chocolates (I2) and still want the jewelry (I3).
- Alex remains happy with the flowers (I1).

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
