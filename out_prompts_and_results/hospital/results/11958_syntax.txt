To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we can deduce the following:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 2, they can assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms so that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy after identifying his symptoms.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to walk to the admissions room to assess Young.
4. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms for treatment.
5. **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy after identifying his symptoms.

Now, let's put this into a JSON object format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_symptomB, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_symptomB, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: Identifies Ross's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.
- **Treat Ross**: Administers the correct treatment based on the assessment, ensuring Ross's health.
- **Walk to Admissions**: Moves Hathaway to the admissions room to assess Young.
- **Assess Young**: Identifies Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.

By following this plan, Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
