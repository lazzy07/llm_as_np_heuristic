**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Admissions, sees that both Jones and Ross are still waiting. Since Young is already in Patient Room A, Hathaway decides to admit Jones to Patient Room C to assess his condition.

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** (Hathaway needs to assess Young's condition first since he is already in an exam room.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** (This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A.** (Assuming Young has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make Young healthy.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.** (Hathaway needs to assess Jones next, who is now in Patient Room C.)

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C.** (Assuming Jones has Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which will make Jones healthy.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** (Hathaway needs to assess Ross next, who is in Patient Room B.)

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.)

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Ross has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make Ross healthy.)

At the end of these actions, all patients—Young, Jones, and Ross—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
