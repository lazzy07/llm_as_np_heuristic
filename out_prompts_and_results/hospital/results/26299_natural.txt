**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, assesses Jones, who is in Admissions. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway decides to assess Jones anyway. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, but due to the high workload, mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. This is a necessary action to determine the symptoms of the patients.

2. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones is actually experiencing Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies. This action is taken to attempt to help Jones, even though it results in a negative outcome.

3. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross. This is necessary to check on another patient.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to the workload still being high, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis as well.

5. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Ross is actually experiencing Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies. This action is taken to attempt to help Ross, but it also results in a negative outcome.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young, who is still waiting.

7. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

8. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Young is actually experiencing Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies. This action is taken to attempt to help Young, but it also results in a negative outcome.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones, Ross, and Young, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at assessing and treating the patients, fulfilling the goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy. However, due to the high workload and subsequent mistakes, the story ends tragically.
