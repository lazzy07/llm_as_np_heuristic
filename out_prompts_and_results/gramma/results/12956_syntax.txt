To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Guard, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Guard, who is currently at the Crossroads and is armed. This action is possible because the Bandit is also armed and the Guard is not carrying a sword. The Bandit will take the coins from the Guard, increasing her total.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Guard, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the camp.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired from the Guard and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Guard**: This is the most critical action as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the law, as the Guard is a legitimate target.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action secures the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, fulfilling her objective.
