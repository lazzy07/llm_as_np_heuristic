In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since Blake believes that the chocolates are in the bathroom, he decides to take action to achieve his goal.

Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom to search for the chocolates. 

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Blake's desire for the chocolates, which is the item he wants to be happy. By moving to the bathroom, Blake can potentially find the chocolates and fulfill his goal.

After Blake moves to the bathroom, he finds the chocolates there. Now, Blake is happy because he has the item he wanted.
