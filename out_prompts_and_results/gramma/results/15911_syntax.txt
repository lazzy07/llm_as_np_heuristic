To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Bandit Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Bandit.

2. **rob(Merchant, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed. This allows the Merchant to take the coin Tom has, increasing her total coins without becoming a criminal.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant returns to the Bandit Camp with her newly acquired coin, ensuring she is safe and can store her coins.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity, as she only robs Tom, who is not armed.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for the Merchant to reach Tom and take action to acquire coins.
- **rob(Merchant, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: This action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to gain a coin from Tom without breaking her moral code, as Tom is unarmed.
- **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: This action ensures the Merchant can safely return to her preferred location with the coins she has acquired.
