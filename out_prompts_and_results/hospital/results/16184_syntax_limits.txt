**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway (Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Hathaway (Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Hathaway (PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to check on the other patients, Jones and Ross, and to continue their work in ensuring all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Young**: This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to identify the specific disease Young has, which is necessary for effective treatment. Without this assessment, Hathaway would not know how to proceed.
  
- **Treating Young**: This action directly addresses the goal of making patients healthy. By administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze), Hathaway ensures that Young recovers, fulfilling their objective as a doctor.

- **Walking to Admissions**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to continue their work and check on the other patients. It keeps the flow of the story moving and allows for potential further actions to help Jones and Ross.
