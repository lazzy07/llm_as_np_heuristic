Hawkins, having successfully dug up the treasure, now stands before Silver, who is eager to claim it for himself. However, Hawkins has a plan to ensure he gets the treasure for himself.

1. **Hawkins takes the treasure.** - This action is necessary for Hawkins to achieve his goal of obtaining the treasure. Since he has already dug it up, he can now claim it.

2. **Hawkins sails back to the port.** - After taking the treasure, Hawkins needs to leave the island and return to the port to secure his possession of the treasure and avoid any confrontation with Silver.

By taking the treasure and sailing back to the port, Hawkins successfully achieves his goal of obtaining the treasure without any conflict with Silver.
