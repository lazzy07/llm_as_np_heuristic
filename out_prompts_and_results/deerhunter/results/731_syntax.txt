To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and get the money. This action is necessary as it takes him to the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then returns to the forest, where he can be safe with the money he has acquired.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba shoots Bambi, ensuring that Bambi is dead. This action fulfills the second part of the goal.

The actions are structured to ensure that Bubba achieves his greedy desire for money while also eliminating Bambi, who is a potential threat to his survival.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
