To achieve Bubba's goal of having 0 money, he needs to ensure that he does not acquire any money, which he already has. The story can be completed with minimal actions, focusing on Bubba's current situation and his desire to remain without money.

### Story Completion:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - Bubba is hungry, and since he has already picked up the rifle and ammunition, he can choose to eat Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action aligns with his current state of hunger.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can shoot Bambi, which allows him to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to eat and fulfill his immediate need.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After killing Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer, which will satisfy his hunger. This action does not affect his money status, as he still has 0 money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Deciding to eat** is essential because it addresses Bubba's hunger, which is a driving force in his actions.
- **Shooting and killing Bambi** is necessary to provide Bubba with food, as he cannot eat without first killing the deer.
- **Eating Bambi** fulfills Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his goal of having 0 money without any distractions.
