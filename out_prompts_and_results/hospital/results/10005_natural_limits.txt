Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their conditions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, this assessment is crucial to identify the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and determines he has Jarkis (rash). Administering steroids will ensure Ross becomes healthy as well.

At this point, both Jones and Ross are treated successfully, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows Dr. Hathaway to gather all patients in one location for assessment.
- The second action is critical for diagnosing Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms.
- The third action treats Jones based on the assumption of Flaze, which is necessary for his recovery.
- The fourth action treats Ross for Jarkis, ensuring he also recovers.
