To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move away from the cottage and towards the crossroads, where she can interact with other characters.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit needs to reach the market to potentially find the merchant and steal coins or items.

3. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, armed with her sword, can rob the merchant who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, which is crucial for her goal of carrying coins.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit will return to her camp to secure the stolen coin.

5. **The bandit places the coin in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the crossroads and then to the market to find the merchant. 
- By robbing the merchant, she successfully acquires a coin without facing any immediate threats since the merchant is unarmed.
- Finally, she returns to her camp to store the coin, fulfilling her goal of having coins in her possession.
