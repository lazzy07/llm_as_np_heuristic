To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is also greedy and wants money, he will need to go back to the bank to steal from the bank clerk, who has money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and focus on his next goal of acquiring money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings Bubba to the location where he can attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and focus on his next goal.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Accomplishes Bubba's goal of obtaining money by threatening the clerk.
