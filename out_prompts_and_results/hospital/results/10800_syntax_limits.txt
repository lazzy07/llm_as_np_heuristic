In this story, we will ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats Jones, who is showing symptoms of a disease, while also managing their workload effectively. The goal is to have all patients healthy by the end of the story.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Ross is currently unassigned to an exam room, and Hathaway needs to know if he has Flaze or Jarkis to treat him properly.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to a room where he can be assessed and treated later.

3. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones in Exam Room B with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms assessed earlier. Since Jones has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will manage to treat Jones effectively while keeping the workload manageable, thus achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is crucial to identify Ross's condition, which will help Hathaway determine if he needs treatment or if he can be left for later.
- **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action prepares Young for future assessment and treatment, ensuring that Hathaway can manage all patients effectively.
- **Treat Jones**: This is the final and most critical action, as it directly leads to Jones's recovery, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
