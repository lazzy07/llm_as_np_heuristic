In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Jones's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will proceed with the assessment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will also make him healthy. 

The actions are designed to ensure that Jones receives the appropriate care based on his symptoms, leading to his recovery.
