Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Jones, who is currently in Patient Room A.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** (This action allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics.** (Assuming Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. Since Jones is alive, this is a safe assumption.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to admit the other patients.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** (This action allows Hathaway to manage Ross's care, ensuring he can be treated next.)

At this point, Jones is healthy, and Hathaway has reduced their workload by treating Jones. The story ends with Hathaway successfully achieving their goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
