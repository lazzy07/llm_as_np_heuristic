To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed for money. The clerk is also in the bank and has no money. Bambi is alive in the forest.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting to eliminate the clerk as a threat, shoots the clerk. This action is necessary to ensure that Bubba can take the money without any opposition.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then decides to go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary if Bubba wants to confront Bambi or check on her.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without resistance.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money from the bank after eliminating the clerk.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba moves to the forest to confront Bambi.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba kills Bambi, ensuring she is dead.

This sequence of actions leads to both conditions being satisfied: Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead.
