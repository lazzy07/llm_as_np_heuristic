Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcanic activity. To ensure their safety and health, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can be safe from the eruptions. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intention, agrees to accompany her to the spaceship, as they both want to remain healthy and safe.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe and healthy. By teleporting, she avoids the dangers of the erupting surface.
   
2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the spaceship.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to ensure that it also remains safe and healthy. This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of safety.

Once they are both on the spaceship, they can explore the universe together, making friends with other creatures, thus achieving their goals.
