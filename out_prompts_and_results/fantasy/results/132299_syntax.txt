To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels to the Village where Talia and Rory are located. This is necessary because Gargax needs to interact with them to achieve their goals.

2. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax eats Talia. This action is crucial because it allows Gargax to eliminate a potential threat (Talia) and also satisfies Gargax's hunger.

3. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Talia, Village)**: After eating Talia, Gargax takes the Treasure from Talia's body. This action is necessary for Gargax to become wealthy, as the Treasure is a valuable item.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring the Treasure) and not hungry (by eating Talia).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the Village**: Gargax needs to be in the same location as Talia and Rory to interact with them.
- **Eating Talia**: This action fulfills Gargax's hunger and removes a character who could potentially interfere with Gargax's plans.
- **Taking the Treasure**: This is the final step to ensure Gargax's wealth, as the Treasure is the item that contributes to this goal.
