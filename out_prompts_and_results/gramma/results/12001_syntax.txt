To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and has the medicine. The Bandit will take the TomCoin from Tom, increasing her coin count.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the BanditCoin from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins, as she will have both the TomCoin and the BanditCoin in her possession.
