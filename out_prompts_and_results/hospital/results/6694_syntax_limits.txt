**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young, who is in the admissions room. Since Young has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will need to admit Young to an exam room first.
   
2. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway admits Young to exam room C, increasing their workload to 3. 

3. **Walk to Exam Room C**: Hathaway walks to exam room C to assess Young's symptoms.

4. **Assess Young Again**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room C. Young shows no symptoms, so Hathaway concludes that Young is healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway then decides to treat Ross in exam room A, who is also healthy. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms, Hathaway treats him with a placebo, ensuring he remains healthy.

6. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway treats Jones in exam room B, who also shows no symptoms, with a placebo as well.

By the end of these actions, all patients are confirmed healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
