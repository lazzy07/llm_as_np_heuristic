In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous. Zoe wants to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard, who is also seeking safety and friendship. 

To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and ensuring that the characters make peace, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface**: This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the surface to interact with the Lizard and to address the imminent danger of the volcano. However, this action will make the Lizard angry, as teleporting from the cave to the surface is not a friendly gesture.

2. **The volcano erupts**: This action is inevitable since the volcano has already begun to erupt. It will lead to the death of one character, which is a part of the story's conclusion.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace**: Despite the anger caused by Zoe's teleportation, they can still make peace before the eruption takes effect. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that they are friends, even in the face of danger.

The final sequence of actions will lead to the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while also establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface, which makes the Lizard angry but allows her to confront the situation directly.
2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to Zoe's demise.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Despite the circumstances, Zoe and the Lizard establish a friendship before the eruption takes effect.
