To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and return to the house. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal of having money, but it provides a logical conclusion to the story.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have 1 money, and the clerk has 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money.)
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (This action concludes the story, showing that Bubba has successfully achieved his goal and is now in a safe location.)

Now, Bubba has 1 money, which fulfills his goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
