To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC. This is important to ensure that Ross's condition is also understood and treated appropriately.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated.

4. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.
