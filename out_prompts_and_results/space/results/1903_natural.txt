Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard, despite their current enmity. She believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface, but she wants to change that perception and make a friend. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and attempt to help him, as she wants to make friends and ensure safety for both of them.

2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - By walking towards the Lizard, Zoe shows her intention to communicate and help, rather than fight. This action is crucial for establishing a connection.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is essential for transforming their relationship from enemies to friends. Zoe's intention to help the Lizard during the eruption demonstrates her desire for friendship.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can face the eruption together, but it ultimately leads to the Lizard's demise.

5. **The Lizard dies.** - The Lizard, despite their newfound friendship, is caught in the eruption, which fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

In summary, the story illustrates Zoe's journey from being an enemy to becoming a friend with the Lizard, culminating in the tragic event of the Lizard's death due to the volcanic eruption. This ending emphasizes the themes of friendship and the unpredictability of nature.
