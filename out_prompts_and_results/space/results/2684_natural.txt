Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to take action to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there is a way to help the Lizard protect the planet.
   
2. **The volcano erupts.** - This is a natural event that occurs as part of the story's setting, creating immediate danger for Zoe.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption, which is a consequence of the previous action.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard, concerned for Zoe, follows her to the surface to check on her and the situation.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** - In the aftermath of Zoe's death, the Lizard reflects on their friendship and the importance of connection, thus making peace with Zoe in spirit.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting and Zoe dying, while also emphasizing the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, culminating in the Lizard's realization of the value of their bond.
