Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows him to assess both Jones and Ross. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, he can still treat Jones with antibiotics, assuming he might have Flaze. This action reduces Hathaway's workload back to 1. 

After treating Jones, Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, so Hathaway treats him with antibiotics as well, again assuming he might have Flaze. 

Finally, Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Ross in Patient Room B. He assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy.

In this sequence of actions, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving his goal of ensuring they are healthy.
