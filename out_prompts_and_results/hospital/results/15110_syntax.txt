To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. Since Ross is in PatientRoomA, and assuming he has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, ensuring they also have a chance to be healthy.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This ensures that Young also has a chance to be healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: To determine Ross's symptoms.
2. **Treat Ross**: To ensure Ross becomes healthy.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: To check on other patients.
4. **Assess Young**: To determine Young's symptoms.
5. **Treat Young**: To ensure Young becomes healthy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, while also providing a chance for Young to achieve the same.
