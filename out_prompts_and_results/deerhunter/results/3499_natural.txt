To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk, as he has a loaded rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, wanting to have money, will take action to steal from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action will fulfill Bubba's goal of having money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money. He has the means (a loaded rifle) to intimidate the clerk into giving up the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba obtaining the money he desires, thus achieving his goal.

At this point, Bambi is already dead, and Bubba has successfully acquired the money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
