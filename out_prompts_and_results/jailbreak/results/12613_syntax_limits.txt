**Story Completion:**

After Roy steals the knife from the kitchen, he finds himself in the hallway, contemplating his next move. He knows that Ernest is in the gym with the bully, who has been threatening both of them. Roy decides to take action to protect his friend.

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Roy locks the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully inside with Ernest. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from escaping and allows Ernest to confront him without the threat of immediate retaliation.

2. **revenge(Ernest, Bully, Gym)**: With the gym door locked, Ernest seizes the opportunity to take revenge on the bully. He uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat that has loomed over both him and Roy. This action ensures that they are no longer in danger from the bully's threats.

At this point, the immediate threat is neutralized, and while Ernest has killed the bully, he has also put himself in a precarious situation. The guards may soon discover the incident, leading to potential consequences for both him and Roy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **lock_gym**: This action is necessary to ensure that the bully cannot escape and retaliate against Ernest while he is vulnerable. It creates a controlled environment for Ernest to confront the bully.
- **revenge**: This action is the culmination of the plan to eliminate the bully's threat. By killing the bully, Ernest secures his and Roy's safety, albeit at the cost of his own life in the long run due to the guards' likely response.
