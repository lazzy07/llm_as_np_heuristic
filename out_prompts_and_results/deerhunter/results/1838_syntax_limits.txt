To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead (or both). Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba acquiring the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he has just eaten Bambi and heads to the bank to confront the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steals the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten, to the bank, where the money is located. It sets up the next action.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling his greedy desire for money. It directly leads to Bubba having the money.
