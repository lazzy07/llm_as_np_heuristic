To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure located in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her primary goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This is necessary for her to interact with Vince and finalize her relationship, which will increase her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. Since she has already accepted his proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.

4. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is included to create a scenario where Vince might need to rely on Talia for food, which can strengthen their bond and happiness.

5. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is included to ensure that Talia becomes wealthy, as she needs to have money to achieve her goal of being wealthy.
