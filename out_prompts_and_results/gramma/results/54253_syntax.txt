To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The bandit will rob the merchant, taking the coin that the merchant has. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly, which is one of her goals.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins she just acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the coins are secured and counts towards her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This is the most direct way for the bandit to acquire coins without drawing the guard's attention, as the merchant is not armed and is vulnerable.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is essential for the bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins without the risk of being attacked or robbed.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action secures the coins in a safe place, ensuring that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest.
