To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to return to the forest after successfully stealing the money.

4. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - This action is taken to fulfill Bubba's hunger and also results in Bambi being dead, achieving the second part of the goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** is essential for Bubba to access the money held by the clerk.
- **Stealing the money** is the direct action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
- **Returning to the forest** is a logical step for Bubba to regroup after the theft.
- **Deciding to eat Bambi** not only satisfies Bubba's hunger but also results in Bambi's death, fulfilling the second condition of the goal.
