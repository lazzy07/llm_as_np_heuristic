To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money from the clerk, as the clerk is the only character with money in this scenario.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and potentially taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest to eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcomes. The first action ensures Bubba has the money, while the second action ensures Bambi is dead.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk and take the money, satisfying the greed that Bubba has developed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to move to the forest where Bambi is located, preparing for the next action.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal. 

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way to achieve the desired outcomes.
