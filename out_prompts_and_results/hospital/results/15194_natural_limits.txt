**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A where Ross is assigned. Ross, who is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, is eager to be treated. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Despite the high workload, this action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming that Ross has Flaze (due to the unknown symptoms), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This is a critical action to ensure Ross's health, as he wants to be alive and healthy.

3. **Action: Ross walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - Explanation: After being treated successfully, Ross walks to Admissions to confirm his health status and possibly check on the other patients.

**Final Explanation:**
The story is kept concise with only three actions. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his condition, treats him based on the assumption of Flaze, and Ross then moves to Admissions to ensure he is healthy. This sequence of actions allows Ross to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
