To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - **Explanation:** Bubba wants money, and the clerk has it. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - **Explanation:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - **Explanation:** After stealing the money, Bubba needs to leave the bank to avoid any potential consequences.

4. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.**  
   - **Explanation:** Bubba is hungry and may want to eat, and since Bambi is in the forest, this action aligns with Bubba's needs.

5. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - **Explanation:** This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money and Bambi is dead, achieving both possible endings.

1. Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.
