To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis believe the Ark is in the USA, so they will travel there to confront Indiana Jones and the US Army. This action is necessary to bring the conflict to a head.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army, armed and aware that Indiana Jones has the Ark, will take the Ark from him by force. This action is crucial for the US Army to gain possession of the Ark.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army will then open the Ark. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army members who opened it. However, this is a necessary sacrifice to ensure the Nazis do not gain immortality.

4. **travel(Nazis, USA, Tanis)**: The Nazis, having arrived in the USA, will travel back to Tanis, believing they have succeeded in their quest for the Ark. This action is necessary to remove them from the immediate conflict.

5. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, Tanis)**: The Nazis will attempt to take the Ark from the US Army, but since the Ark is now in Tanis and the US Army is dead, they will find it empty. This action leads to their demise as they realize they have been outmaneuvered.

The story concludes with the US Army having the Ark (albeit at the cost of their lives) and the Nazis being dead, as they are unable to achieve their goal of immortality.
