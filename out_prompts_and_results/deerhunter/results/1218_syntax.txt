To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is also present in the bank, and Bambi is in the forest, alive.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it will eliminate the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and the bank clerk is dead, which satisfies the conditions of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only obstacle preventing Bubba from taking the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money from the bank, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.
