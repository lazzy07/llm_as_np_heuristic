In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (flowers) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) has put down the flowers (I1) in the same room (R22) where Alex and Blake (C2) are located. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the flowers that Casey has put down. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from Casey in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake and Casey will still be unhappy, but the goal of Alex has been achieved.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness in the story.
