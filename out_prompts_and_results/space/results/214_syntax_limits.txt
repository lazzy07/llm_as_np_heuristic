Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is also present. She knows that the surface is dangerous due to the volcano beginning to erupt, and she wants to make friends with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and extend a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. By making peace, they can work together to escape the impending danger of the volcano.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe and the Lizard are making peace, the volcano on the surface begins to erupt. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where the volcano erupts, creating a sense of urgency.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing lava to flow and creating a hazardous environment on the surface. This action leads to the climax of the story, where the danger becomes real.

4. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: In a tragic turn of events, as the eruption causes chaos, the Lizard, in a moment of panic, accidentally causes a rockfall that fatally injures Zoe. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying, while also highlighting the unforeseen consequences of the eruption.

After these actions, Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, but the eruption leads to Zoe's demise, creating a bittersweet ending where friendship was achieved, but at a great cost.
