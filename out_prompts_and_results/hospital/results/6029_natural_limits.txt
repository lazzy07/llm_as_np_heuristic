Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A with Ross. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat each patient. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - **Reason:** Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is currently in Admissions. This action reduces the workload by allowing Hathaway to see all patients.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - **Reason:** This action assigns Jones to the correct exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess him properly. It also increases the workload to 4, but Hathaway will assess Jones next.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - **Reason:** Hathaway needs to assess Jones in his assigned room to determine his symptoms.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - **Reason:** This action allows Hathaway to identify Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. 

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - **Reason:** Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. This reduces the workload back to 3.

Next, Dr. Hathaway will repeat the process for Ross and Young, ensuring they are also treated correctly. 

**Final Explanation:** The actions taken ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat Jones, which is crucial for achieving the goal of having all patients healthy. The sequence of actions is efficient, allowing Hathaway to manage the workload while ensuring patient care.
