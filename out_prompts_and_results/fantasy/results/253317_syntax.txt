To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to secure wealth and happiness while avoiding hunger. Given the current situation, Rory has already proposed to Talia, and she has accepted, which means they are in a relationship that can lead to happiness. Rory also has the treasure, which contributes to his wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave to be with Talia and Vince, where he can discuss their future and share his treasure.
2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels back to the cave to be with Rory, solidifying their relationship and allowing them to plan their future together.
3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village, leaving the cave and allowing Rory and Talia to be alone.
4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia in the cave, which makes both of them happy.
5. **pickup(Rory, Money, Cave)**: Rory picks up the money from Vince's body in the cave, increasing his wealth.
6. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with Talia, where they can enjoy their new life together.

After these actions, Rory will be happy due to his marriage to Talia, wealthy because he has both the treasure and the money, and not hungry since there are no actions that lead to hunger.
