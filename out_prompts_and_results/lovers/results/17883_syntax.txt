To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Casey to potentially interact with them.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn aligns with Alex's own happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making them happy, while Casey will also be happy because they received the flowers.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the dining room to pick up the flowers.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This is the action that allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is what they want.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to return to the living room to interact with Casey.
- **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: By giving the flowers to Casey, Alex ensures that both of them can be happy.
