To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the chocolates.**  
   - This action is a lie, but it serves to mislead Casey into thinking that Alex is not interested in the jewelry, which is crucial for the next steps.

3. **Blake gives chocolates to Casey.**  
   - This action allows Casey to receive an item, which is necessary for Blake to feel happy, even if it is not what Blake truly wants.

4. **Casey gives jewelry to Blake.**  
   - This action allows Casey to fulfill their goal of being happy by giving away the jewelry, which Blake believes is what they want.

5. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps Blake to feel satisfied with the chocolates.

6. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to be with Blake and ensures that they are both in the same room, which is important for their interaction.

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex is still not happy, but the focus is on Casey's happiness.
