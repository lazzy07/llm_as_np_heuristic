**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is showing symptoms of Fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she prioritizes treating Ross to ensure he becomes healthy.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Ross is experiencing Fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. By treating him correctly, Hathaway can help him become healthy.

After treating Ross, Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. She then assesses Young, who is still in Admissions and has unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him later.

Now, Hathaway can focus on treating Young. She assesses Young in Patient Room C.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Unknown symptoms.** This action is necessary to determine what treatment Young needs. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot treat him yet.

Next, Hathaway decides to return to Admissions to assess Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.** This action is necessary to reach Jones and assess his condition.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown symptoms.** This action is necessary to determine what treatment Jones needs. Since Jones's symptoms are also unknown, Hathaway cannot treat him yet.

At this point, Hathaway has treated Ross successfully, and he is now healthy. She has assessed both Young and Jones, but their conditions remain unclear. However, since her primary goal is to ensure that at least one patient is healthy, she has achieved her goal with Ross.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Ross was essential to ensure he became healthy, which is Hathaway's primary goal.
- Admitting Young was necessary to keep the flow of patients moving and to prepare for his assessment.
- Assessing Young and Jones was necessary to gather information about their conditions, even though it did not lead to immediate treatment.
- Walking between rooms was necessary for Hathaway to manage her patients effectively.
