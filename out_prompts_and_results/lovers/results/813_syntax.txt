To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3)**: This action is necessary for Alex to understand what Casey desires, which will help in the next steps.
   - Action: `tell(C3, C1, I3, R12)`

2. **Alex picks up the jewelry (I3) from the bedroom (R12)**: Since Alex is in the same room as the jewelry, they can pick it up.
   - Action: `pick_up(C1, I3, R12)`

3. **Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R12)**: Alex can now give the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire.
   - Action: `give(C1, I3, C3, R12)`

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they want, making them happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Tell Action**: This is crucial for communication. By telling Alex what they want, Casey sets the stage for Alex to take action to help them.
- **Pick Up Action**: Alex needs to physically obtain the jewelry to be able to give it to Casey. This action is straightforward since they are in the same room.
- **Give Action**: This final action is the culmination of the previous steps, where Alex transfers the jewelry to Casey, thus achieving Casey's goal of happiness.
