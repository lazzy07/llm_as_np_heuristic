To ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure that Casey ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the jewelry (I3) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they want, which will make them happy.

2. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake (C2) puts down the chocolates (I2) they have in the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to clear the space and allows for a more organized exchange.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey (C3) moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that Blake (C2) has just put down. This action is not directly related to Casey's happiness but shows that Casey is also considering Blake's happiness.
