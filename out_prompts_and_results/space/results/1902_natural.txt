Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are enemies. To achieve a resolution, Zoe needs to establish a friendship with the Lizard while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the danger of the surface and to show the Lizard that she is willing to face the threat together. 

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is triggered as Zoe is on the surface, creating a sense of urgency and danger that can lead to a pivotal moment for both characters.

3. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the cave.** - This action is taken to escape the eruption and to return to safety, but it makes the Lizard angry. This anger can serve as a catalyst for a confrontation or a resolution.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard begin to fight.** - This action is necessary to create tension and to explore the dynamics of their relationship. 

5. **Zoe stuns the Lizard.** - By stunning the Lizard, Zoe can take control of the situation and create an opportunity for dialogue rather than continued fighting.

6. **Zoe breaks free from the stun.** - This action allows the Lizard to regain composure and consider the situation more clearly.

7. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial for transforming their relationship from enemies to friends, aligning with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

8. **The volcano finishes erupting.** - This final event occurs after the characters have made peace, leading to a dramatic conclusion where the Lizard, now a friend, helps Zoe escape the eruption.

In summary, the story unfolds with Zoe taking actions that lead to a confrontation with the Lizard, but ultimately, through a series of events, they manage to make peace. The eruption serves as a backdrop that emphasizes the urgency of their situation and the importance of their newfound friendship.
