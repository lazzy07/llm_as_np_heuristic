To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) is already happy with the jewelry (I3), but both Alex (C1) and Blake (C2) are not happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential for Blake to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey. This is important for social interaction and to ensure that Blake can share their happiness.

4. **give(C2, I2, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to themselves (C2). This action is a bit unconventional but serves to confirm that Blake is now happy with the item they wanted.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates, fulfilling their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to be in the room with the chocolates to pick them up.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: This is the action that allows Blake to acquire the item they want.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room to be with the other characters, which is important for social dynamics.
- **give(C2, I2, C2, R22)**: This confirms that Blake has the chocolates and is now happy.
