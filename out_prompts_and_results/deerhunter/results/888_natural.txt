To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, wanting the money, will decide to steal it from the clerk.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, which will result in the clerk being dead and Bubba taking the money.
3. **Bubba picks up the money**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money that the clerk had.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.
3. **Bubba picks up the money**: This final action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement.
