Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A and assesses Ross. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown symptom, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze due to the fever symptom. 

2. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Jones is also experiencing an unknown symptom, but Dr. Hathaway, still with a workload of 2, correctly identifies that Jones has Jarkis due to the rash symptom.

4. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Jones becomes healthy.

At this point, both Ross and Jones are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions**:
- Assessing Ross and Jones allows Dr. Hathaway to identify their conditions accurately.
