In the current situation, Rory is at the cave, and Talia is at the village. Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, which will make him wealthy. Since Talia is already married to Rory, he is happy. 

To achieve his goal, Rory will take the following action:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** This action is necessary for Rory to reach Talia and potentially access the treasure, as it is currently at the cave.

After this action, Rory will be at the village, where he can interact with Talia and Vince, who has the money. However, since the goal is to ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can conclude here, as Rory is already happy due to his marriage to Talia.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Traveling from the cave to the village**: This action allows Rory to move closer to Talia and the potential for wealth. Since Talia is already married to Rory, he is happy, and by being at the village, he can strategize on how to acquire the treasure.
