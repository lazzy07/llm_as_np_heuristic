In this story, Young is currently in Exam Room A, where Hathaway is present. Young has been assessed and has shown SymptomA, which is a symptom of Flaze. Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if she assesses another patient. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Since Young has SymptomA, Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.
