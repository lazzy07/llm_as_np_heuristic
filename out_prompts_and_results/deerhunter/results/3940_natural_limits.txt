Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action. He aims the rifle at the bank clerk, who is standing in front of him with the money. Bubba, wanting to have the money, steals the clerk's money while threatening him with the loaded rifle. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money without resistance. 

Now, Bubba has the money he desired, and the story ends with Bubba achieving his goal.
