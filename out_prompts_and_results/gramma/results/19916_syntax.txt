To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit starts at the Cottage and walks to the Crossroads to confront Tom, who is currently there.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coins he is carrying. This action is possible because Tom is not armed, and the Bandit is armed with a sword.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit walks back to the Camp to secure the stolen coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from Tom and places them in the chest at the Camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit first walks to the Crossroads to encounter Tom, who is an easy target since he is unarmed.
- By robbing Tom, the Bandit successfully acquires the coins he is carrying, which directly contributes to her goal.
- The Bandit then walks back to the Camp to ensure the coins are safely stored, fulfilling her objective of having coins in the chest.
