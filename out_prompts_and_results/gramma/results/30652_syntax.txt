To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Camp, leaving Tom and the Merchant at the Crossroads. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to secure her coins in the chest at the Camp, which will allow the Merchant to operate without the threat of being robbed.

2. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads after securing her coins. This action is necessary for the Merchant to return to a safe location where she can interact with Tom without the Bandit present.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Camp)**: Tom will walk to the Camp to retrieve the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to fulfill his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk to the Market to continue her business. This action is necessary for the Merchant to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and acquire coins.

5. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the TomCoin from Tom, giving him a coin in exchange. This action is necessary for the Merchant to acquire coins without becoming a criminal.

6. **walk(Tom, Camp, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads after retrieving the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to return to a safe location.

7. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk to the Cottage carrying the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant successfully acquires a coin without engaging in criminal activity, while Tom achieves his goal of carrying the medicine back to the Cottage.
