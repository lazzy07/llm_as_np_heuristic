To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the cottage, where he wants to be.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to fulfill Tom's goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage, as he has already purchased it from the merchant.

The story is very straightforward because Tom's goal is simply to be at the cottage with the medicine, which he already possesses. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, allowing him to achieve his goal without conflict.
