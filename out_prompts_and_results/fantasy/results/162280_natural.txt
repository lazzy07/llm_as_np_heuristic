To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and Rory needs to interact with him to achieve wealth.

2. **Vince gives the money to Rory.**  
   - This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy. Since Rory is at the cave and Vince is now there, this transfer can happen.

3. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Rory to gain additional wealth, contributing to his goal of being wealthy.

4. **Rory's happiness increases as he now has money and treasure.**  
   - This is a result of the previous actions, as Rory's goals are being met.

5. **Rory becomes not hungry.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to fulfill his goal of not being hungry.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Vince travels from the village to the cave.
2. Vince gives the money to Rory.
3. Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.
4. Rory becomes not hungry.
