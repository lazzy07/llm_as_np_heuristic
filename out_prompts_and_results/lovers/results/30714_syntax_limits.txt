In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in the room). 

Here’s the shortest story where Blake achieves their goal:

1. **Action: give(Blake, I1, Alex, R11)** - Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R11). This action is necessary because Alex wants I3, and by giving I1, Blake ensures that Alex is happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they received the item they wanted (I3).
- Blake is also happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The action of giving the jewelry (I1) to Alex directly fulfills Alex's desire for happiness, which is Blake's primary goal. Since Alex is now happy, Blake also achieves their happiness through this action.
