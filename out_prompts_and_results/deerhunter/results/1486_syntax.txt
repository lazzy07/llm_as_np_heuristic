To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Since he is currently in the forest after eating Bambi, he needs to go to the bank where the bank clerk is located to achieve this goal. Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the bank clerk is located. This action is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba confirms his greed and desire for money, solidifying his goal. This action is implicit in the previous actions but reinforces his motivation.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling his goal of acquiring money.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This reinforces Bubba's motivation and confirms that he has achieved his goal.
