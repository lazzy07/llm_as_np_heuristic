Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport to the surface to help the Lizard. She believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface, but she hopes to change that perception by showing her willingness to assist. Upon arriving, she sees the Lizard struggling with the volcanic activity. Instead of fighting, Zoe approaches the Lizard and offers her help, which surprises the Lizard. 

The Lizard, initially wary, recognizes Zoe's intentions and they begin to communicate. They share their fears about the volcano and their desire for safety. This moment of vulnerability leads to a bond forming between them, and they agree to work together to find a way to ensure their mutual safety.
