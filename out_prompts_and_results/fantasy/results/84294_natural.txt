To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave, and the treasure is also at the cave. Since Talia has already married both Rory and Vince, her happiness is tied to her wealth. The quickest way to achieve Talia's happiness or wealth is for her to acquire the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia becoming wealthy:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - This action is necessary because it allows Talia to increase her wealth, which is one of her goals. By picking up the treasure, she will become wealthy.

2. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action is included to remove Rory from the story, as he is currently at the cave and could potentially interfere with Talia's plans. Since Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, he will eat Rory, which also aligns with his goals.

3. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's dead body.** - This action allows Gargax to gain wealth, but it also ensures that Rory is no longer a factor in Talia's happiness or wealth. Talia's wealth is already secured by the treasure she picked up.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, which makes her wealthy, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Talia picks up the treasure:** This directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.
- **Gargax eats Rory:** This removes a potential obstacle for Talia and allows Gargax to fulfill his own goal of not being hungry.
- **Gargax takes the money from Rory's dead body:** This action does not affect Talia's wealth but ensures that Gargax achieves his goal of wealth.
