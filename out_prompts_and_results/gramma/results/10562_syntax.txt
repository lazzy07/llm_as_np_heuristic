To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit will walk back to the camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the bandit prefers to be at the camp and wants to ensure the coins are safely stored there.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible.

The story is short because the bandit already has the coins from Tom and simply needs to return to the camp to secure them. The actions taken are straightforward and directly lead to the bandit's goal without unnecessary complications.
