Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition. However, since Ross is alive, he survives the treatment despite it being the wrong one.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. Young is also found to have a fever, indicating Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him as well.

In the end, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
