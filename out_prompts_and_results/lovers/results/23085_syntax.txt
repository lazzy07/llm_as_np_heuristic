To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Currently, Blake (C2) is not happy because they have the flowers (I3) instead of the jewelry. 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the bathroom (R12) to access the jewelry (I2) that is in the dining room (R21).
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room (R21).
3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R21) to be with Alex and Casey.
4. **give(C2, I2, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to themselves, ensuring they have the item they want.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry (I2). 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R21, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to access the jewelry, which is in the dining room.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake needs to pick up the jewelry to fulfill their desire for it.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake returns to the dining room to be with the other characters after picking up the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I2, C2, R21)**: This action is a bit unconventional, but it ensures that Blake has the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
