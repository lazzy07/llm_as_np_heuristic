Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. The clerk has the money that Bubba desires. To achieve his goal, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money without needing to go back to the forest or find Bambi.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, and the story will conclude with him achieving his goal.
