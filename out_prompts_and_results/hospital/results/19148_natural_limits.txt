Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is crucial to determine Ross's symptoms. However, due to Hathaway's increased workload, he mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze instead of the unknown condition.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze with antibiotics.** This action is taken based on the incorrect assessment. Since Ross does not have Flaze, he dies. However, this action is still part of the process to ensure Hathaway's goal of treating patients.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics.** This action is necessary because Jones is experiencing fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. This treatment successfully makes Jones healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal for at least one patient.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.** This action is taken to determine Young's condition. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot treat him correctly, but he has already achieved his goal with Jones.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, even though Ross dies due to a misdiagnosis.
