To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage with Vince, as she has already accepted his proposal. Since Talia is currently in the Cave and Vince is in the Village, the most efficient action is for Talia to travel to the Village where Vince is located. Once she arrives, they can get married, which will make Talia happy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels from the Cave to the Village to be with Vince, who she has accepted to marry. This action is necessary for Talia to reach Vince and fulfill her relationship goal.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Once Talia arrives in the Village, she marries Vince. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
