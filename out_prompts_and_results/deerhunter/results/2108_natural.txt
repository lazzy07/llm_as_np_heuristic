To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and wants to have money, while the clerk has 1 money. The simplest way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk, as he has a loaded rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has it.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money.)

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
