To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants to be happy, which means they need to acquire the item they desire, which is the jewelry (I2). 

Given the current situation, we know:
- Alex (C1) is in R22 and has the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) is in R22 and has the chocolates (I3).
- Blake (C2) is in R22 and wants the jewelry (I2).

Since Alex has the jewelry (I1) and Blake wants it, Blake can trade their chocolates (I3) for the jewelry (I1) with Alex. This will make Blake happy, as they will have the item they want.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to acquire the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22;
- at(I1) = C2; at(I2) = ?; at(I3) = C1;
- happy(C1) = False; happy(C2) = True; happy(C3) = False;
- wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3;

Blake is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness. It directly addresses Blake's desire for the jewelry and fulfills their goal.
