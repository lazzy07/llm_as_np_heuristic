To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia is already married to Rory, her happiness is guaranteed through their relationship. However, to achieve wealth, Talia needs to acquire the treasure. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can increase her wealth.

After this action, Talia will have the treasure, which will make her wealthy. Since she is already married to Rory, her happiness is also secured.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy. 

Now, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure).
