To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be on the surface to interact with Zoe, who is currently on the spaceship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to meet the Lizard and to begin the process of making peace.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard will make peace on the surface. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship and safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will erupt. This action is included to create a sense of urgency and danger, but since both characters are now friends and safe, they can work together to escape the eruption.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe will walk back to the spaceship. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the eruption.

6. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to return to a safe location away from the eruption.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
