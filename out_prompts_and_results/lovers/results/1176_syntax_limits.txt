In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Blake is located. This action is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(Blake, I3, Casey, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted. Since Casey also wants Blake to be happy, and Blake is happy giving away the jewelry, both characters achieve their goals.
