To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the same room as Casey (C3) and Blake (C2), and they all want different items. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I2), which is not what they want, but they are not the focus of this story.
- Blake will still have the flowers (I3), which is also not the focus.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
