In the current situation, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (the flowers). However, Casey and Blake are not happy because they do not have the items they want. Blake wants the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R21). 

To help Blake achieve their goal of happiness, Alex can tell Blake that they want the chocolates, which will prompt Blake to take action. 

Here’s the story:

1. **tell(C1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that they want the chocolates. This action is necessary because it informs Blake of what Alex wants, which can motivate Blake to take action to help Alex, and indirectly help themselves.

After this action, Blake realizes that they can help Alex by getting the chocolates, which will also make them happy. 

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["tell(C1, C2, I2, R22)"]
}
```

This single action is sufficient for Blake to understand their next steps towards achieving happiness, as it sets the stage for further actions that can lead to their goal.
