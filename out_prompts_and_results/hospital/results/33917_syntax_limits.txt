In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in a critical situation with a workload of three, which means they are at risk of making a mistake. However, they have already assessed Young and know that Young is showing symptoms of SymptomB. Since SymptomB corresponds to Jarkis, Hathaway can treat Young correctly. 

To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Since Hathaway has assessed Young and knows they have SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Young healthy.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine their symptoms and ensure they receive the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to find out what symptoms they are showing. This is crucial to determine the appropriate treatment for Jones.

By treating Young correctly, Hathaway ensures that at least one patient is healthy. After assessing Jones, Hathaway can then decide on the next steps for Jones and Ross, but the immediate goal of making one patient healthy is achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
