Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, he grabs the knife. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway, where he can confront the bully.

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the laundry room, is unaware of Ernest's plan. He decides to stay put and keep the cigarettes hidden, hoping to use them as leverage later.

Ernest, now armed with the knife, locks the gym door behind him as he enters. The bully, surprised and cornered, tries to threaten Ernest, but Ernest, fueled by the need to survive, retaliates and kills the bully.
