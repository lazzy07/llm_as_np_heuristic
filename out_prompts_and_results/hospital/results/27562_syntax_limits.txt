In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room B with Jones, who is also in the same room. Ross is in Admissions, and Young is also in Admissions. Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient without reducing their workload first.

To achieve the goal efficiently, Hathaway will first assess Jones to determine their symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient in the room, this action is necessary to identify the correct treatment. After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine what disease Jones has, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By following these two actions, Hathaway can effectively reduce their workload and treat Jones correctly, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
