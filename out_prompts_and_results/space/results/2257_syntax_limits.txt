In this story, Zoe is on her spaceship while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous. Zoe, wanting to ensure her safety and the Lizard's, decides to teleport back to the surface to check on the Lizard and make sure they can both escape the eruption together.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to be closer to the Lizard and assess the situation. This action is necessary for her to interact with the Lizard and ensure their safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action allows her to reach the Lizard and communicate with him about the impending danger of the volcano.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave. This action is crucial as it solidifies their friendship and ensures that they can work together to escape the eruption.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard, ensuring they are friends before the eruption occurs. The eruption itself is a natural consequence of the story's setting, leading to a dramatic conclusion.
