After Hawkins spread the rumor about the treasure being buried on the island, he and Silver sailed to the island together. Once they arrived, Hawkins dug up the treasure, and since he was the one who dug it up, he took the treasure for himself.

Here’s the breakdown of the actions:

1. **dig()**: Hawkins digs up the treasure. This action is necessary because it allows him to access the treasure that he desires.
2. **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: Hawkins takes the treasure. This action is essential for Hawkins to achieve his goal of obtaining the treasure.

The story is concise and directly leads to Hawkins achieving his goal of taking the treasure.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
