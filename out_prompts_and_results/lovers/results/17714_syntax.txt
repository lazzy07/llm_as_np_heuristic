To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) to be closer to Alex and Casey.
2. **tell(C2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers (I1) while in the living room. This is a strategic move to inform Casey about Alex's desire.
3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) to pick up the flowers.
4. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R22).
5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R21) to give the flowers to Alex.
