To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also alive in the forest, and Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This will also eliminate Bambi, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary to actually kill Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat her, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially take the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
