To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

6. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Ross's diagnosis, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, thus achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
