To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is currently at the Camp and will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with the Bandit and the Guard.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk from the Market to the Crossroads, where she can interact with the Merchant.

3. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, will rob the Bandit of her coins. This action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to gain coins without becoming a criminal, since the Bandit is already a criminal.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will then walk back to the Market to be in a safe location where she can continue her business.

5. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk from the Market to the Crossroads, where he can keep an eye on the situation.

6. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit’s location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is dealt with and that the Merchant remains in good standing.

7. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Market)**: The Guard will walk back to the Market, where he can take action against the Bandit.

By following these actions, the Merchant successfully acquires coins from the Bandit while ensuring she does not engage in criminal activity herself. The Bandit is left vulnerable, and the Guard is alerted to her presence, allowing the Merchant to maintain her status.
