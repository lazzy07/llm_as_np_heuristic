**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Young does not survive the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address the other patients in the admissions room.

3. **Walk from Patient Room C to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones and Ross.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Jones does not survive the treatment.

6. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Once more, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Ross does not survive the treatment.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although well-intentioned, lead to the unfortunate demise of all patients due to her mistakes caused by her high workload. However, she has done her best to treat them, fulfilling her goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, even if the outcome was tragic.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young, Jones, and Ross was necessary to determine their conditions, even though the assessments were flawed due to Hathaway's high workload.
- Treating each patient was essential to attempt to make them healthy, aligning with Hathaway's goal.
- The walking actions were necessary for Hathaway to move between rooms to assess and treat the patients.
