### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment_for_Jones, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_Ross, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_Young, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, the specific treatments for Jones, Ross, and Young would depend on the symptoms identified during the assessments.
