Ernest, after completing his chores in the kitchen, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, and he has the pack of cigarettes that the bully wants. To ensure his safety and to avoid any threats, he quickly moves to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, he takes a moment to think. He knows that the bully is a danger to him and Roy, and he needs to act fast. He decides to crawl through the vents to reach the gym. 

In the gym, he finds the bully, who is unaware of his presence. With the knife he has from the kitchen, Ernest takes revenge on the bully, killing him. This act not only eliminates the threat but also secures his safety and that of his friend Roy.
