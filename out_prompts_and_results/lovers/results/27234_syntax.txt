To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that the jewelry is with Casey (C3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the chocolates (I2) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey (C3) will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy since they wanted to make Blake happy, and Blake is happy with the chocolates.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R21)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, fulfilling their desire for happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
