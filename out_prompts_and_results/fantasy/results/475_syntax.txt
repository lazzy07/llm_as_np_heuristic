To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow Rory to gain wealth and happiness while ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where Talia is located. This is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and potentially gain the treasure.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has already proposed and Rory accepted, this action will make both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Traveling to the Cave**: Rory needs to be in the same location as Talia to interact with her and to pick up the treasure. This is a necessary step to achieve his goals.
  
- **Picking up the Treasure**: Acquiring the treasure is essential for Rory to become wealthy. Without this action, Rory would not achieve his wealth goal.

- **Marrying Talia**: Since Talia and Rory are already in a proposed relationship, marrying her will make both of them happy. This fulfills Rory's goal of happiness.

At the end of these actions, Rory is wealthy (due to the treasure) and happy (due to marrying Talia), and he remains not hungry since there are no actions that would lead to hunger.
