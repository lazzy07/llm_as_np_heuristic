**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to walk from the crossroads to the market. This action allows her to return to her preferred location where she can sell items and potentially acquire more coins.

2. Once at the market, the merchant uses the hero's coin she looted from the bandit to buy one of the swords from the merchant's own stock. This action increases her inventory and gives her a weapon for protection, ensuring she can defend herself if needed.

3. The merchant then walks back to the crossroads, where she can continue to sell her items or interact with other characters.

4. The merchant decides to sell the medicine she has to Tom, the hero, for another coin. This action allows her to gain another coin while providing Tom with the medicine he desires.

5. Finally, the merchant walks back to the market, satisfied with her transactions and having achieved her goal of acquiring more coins without resorting to criminal activity.

- The final return to the market signifies her successful transactions and her preference for being in a commercial environment.
