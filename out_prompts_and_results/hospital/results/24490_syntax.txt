To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room A**: Young will walk from Admissions to PatientRoomA. This action is not directly related to Ross's goal but is necessary to keep the story moving and to ensure Young is also considered in the hospital setting.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are being cared for, even if it does not directly impact Ross's outcome.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are healthy, aligning with Hathaway's goal.

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms.
