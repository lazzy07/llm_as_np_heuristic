Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, stands in the bank with a loaded rifle. He sees the bank clerk, who has money, and decides to take action. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk, killing him instantly. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money, as the clerk is the only one with cash in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his greed and allows him to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully obtains the money he desires, and the story concludes with him achieving his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential: the first action eliminates the obstacle (the clerk) who possesses the money, and the second action allows Bubba to claim the money, thus fulfilling his greed.
