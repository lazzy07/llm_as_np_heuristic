   - **Reason:** This action is necessary for Ernest to protect himself against the bully, who has threatened both him and Roy.

   - **Reason:** By moving to the hallway, Ernest can access the gym where Roy and the bully are located, allowing him to confront the situation directly.

3. **Action: Ernest locks the gym door.**  
   - **Reason:** Locking the gym door prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that Ernest can confront him without interference.

4. **Action: Ernest enters the gym and confronts the bully.**  
   - **Reason:** This action is crucial for Ernest to face the bully directly and take control of the situation.

5. **Action: Ernest kills the bully with the knife.**

With the bully dead, Ernest is no longer threatened, and he can now focus on finding a pack of cigarettes, which he knows is still in the prison. He can later retrieve it without fear of the bully's retaliation.
