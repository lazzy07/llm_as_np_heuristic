In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. After eating both Talia and Vince, Gargax is left in the Village with no obstacles to his goal. The only remaining character is Rory, who is alive but does not have any wealth. Gargax can simply take the money from Vince's dead body, which is still in the Village.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth.

This is the shortest story where Gargax achieves their goal of becoming wealthy without any unnecessary actions.
