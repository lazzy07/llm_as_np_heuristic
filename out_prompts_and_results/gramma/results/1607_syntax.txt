To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.** 
   - This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market where he currently is and move towards the crossroads, which is the path to the cottage.

2. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**
   - This action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, from the crossroads.

3. **Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant.**
   - Since the medicine is located with the Merchant, Tom needs to buy it to carry it with him to the cottage. He has a coin to make this purchase.

4. **Tom walks from Cottage to Crossroads.**
   - This action is not necessary for Tom to achieve his goal, as he is already at the cottage with the medicine. However, if we consider the goal to be at the cottage with the medicine, this action can be omitted.

5. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**
   - This action is also not necessary for Tom to achieve his goal, as he is already at the cottage with the medicine.

The final sequence of actions that directly lead to Tom achieving his goal is:

1. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.**
2. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**
3. **Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant.**

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
