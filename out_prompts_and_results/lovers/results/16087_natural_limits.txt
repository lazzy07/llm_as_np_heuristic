In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present, but none of them are happy. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey also wants the jewelry. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action occurs:

1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex.** This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows: 
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake is still not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is still not happy because they do not have the jewelry.

This action is the only necessary step to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
