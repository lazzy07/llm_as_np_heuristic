Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she looks at the Lizard, the guardian of this world. Both are aware of the dangerous environment around them, but they have just made peace, establishing a friendly relationship. To ensure their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

**Action:** Zoe teleports to the spaceship.

**Explanation:** By teleporting to the spaceship, Zoe ensures her safety from the dangerous conditions on the surface, which is crucial for her goal of being healthy and safe. This action also allows her to prepare for future interactions with the Lizard, as she can return to the surface later with resources or tools to help foster their friendship.
