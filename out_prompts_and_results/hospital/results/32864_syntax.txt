To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, ensuring that they are also taken care of, but this action is not necessary for Young's goal.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated properly.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are healthy, but it is not directly related to Young's goal.

6. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Ross is also treated properly.

7. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are healthy, but it is not directly related to Young's goal.
