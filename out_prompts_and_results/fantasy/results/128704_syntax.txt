To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who has already accepted her marriage proposal. Since they are both in the Cave, they can get married, which will make Talia happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action will allow Talia and Rory to get married, which will increase Talia's happiness to a positive value. Since Rory is already wealthy due to having the treasure, this marriage will also contribute to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy indirectly, as they can share their wealth.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **Marrying Rory**: Talia's primary goal is to be happy, and since Rory has accepted her proposal, marrying him will fulfill that goal. Additionally, Rory's possession of the treasure means that Talia will also benefit from his wealth, aligning with her desire to be wealthy.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Talia achieving her goal of happiness through marriage, while also setting the stage for potential wealth through her relationship with Rory.
