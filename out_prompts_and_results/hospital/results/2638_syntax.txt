To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Jones's health status is currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on the assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate medication based on the symptoms identified. This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This action is essential because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate medication based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is critical for Jones to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

By following these actions, Jones will successfully become healthy, fulfilling his goal.
