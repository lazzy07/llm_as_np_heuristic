In the living room, Alex is happy with the flowers. Blake, however, is not happy because he wants the chocolates, and Casey is not happy because she wants the jewelry. To help Blake achieve his happiness, Alex decides to take action.

**Action:** Alex gives the flowers to Casey.

**Explanation:** By giving the flowers to Casey, Alex ensures that Casey is now happy because she has received the item she wanted (the flowers). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to fulfill Casey's desire, which indirectly helps Blake feel better about the situation, as he sees that Alex is willing to share and help others. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is no longer happy because he has given away the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because he still wants the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because she has the flowers.

However, since the goal is for Alex to achieve happiness, this action does not fulfill that requirement. Therefore, the story can be concluded here, as Alex's goal is not achieved.
