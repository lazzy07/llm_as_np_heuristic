**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to secure his safety and get out of the prison. He quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. With the bully unable to threaten him or Roy, Ernest then puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. Finally, he crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison, where he escapes.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Lock the gym door**: This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from coming after Ernest and Roy, ensuring their safety.
2. **Put on the civilian clothes**: This disguises Ernest, allowing him to blend in and avoid detection as he makes his escape.
3. **Crawl through the vents to the highway**: This is the final action that leads to Ernest's escape from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
