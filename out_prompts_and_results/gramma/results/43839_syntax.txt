To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Bandit.

2. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant then walks to the Market, where she can potentially sell items or interact with Tom.

3. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Merchant buys the coin from Tom, giving her one more coin without committing a crime.

4. **walk(Merchant, Market, Camp)**: The Merchant returns to the Camp with her newly acquired coin.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. The Merchant successfully buys a coin from Tom, increasing her wealth while remaining within the bounds of legality.
