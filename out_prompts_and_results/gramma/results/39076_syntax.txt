To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves from the Crossroads to the Market to confront Tom and take the coins he has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coin that Tom has. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads to secure her coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to interact with Tom.
- Robbing Tom is essential because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without any risk of being attacked, as Tom is unarmed.
- Returning to the Crossroads is necessary to secure her coins in the chest, which is her preferred location.
- Finally, taking the coins from the chest ensures that the Bandit maximizes her coin count.
