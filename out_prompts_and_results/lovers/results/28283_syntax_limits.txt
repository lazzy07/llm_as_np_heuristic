In the current situation, Casey wants to be happy and has a desire for the chocolates (I3). However, Casey is currently not happy because they do not have the item they want. 

To achieve Casey's goal, the simplest action would be for Blake to give Casey the chocolates, as Blake is in the same room and has the chocolates.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **give(Blake, I3, Casey, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the chocolates, making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = R21; at(I2) = R21; at(I3) = R22; happy(C1) = False; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = True; wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3; 

Now, Casey is happy because they have the chocolates they wanted.

### Explanation of the action:
- The action of giving the chocolates is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire and results in their happiness. Since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this action is the most efficient way to achieve that.
