In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. They are not currently fighting, but their relationship is strained. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and make peace. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can work together to ensure their safety.

2. **Erupt**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt, which will lead to a character dying. Since both characters are on the surface and the volcano is erupting, they will both be affected by this event.

The story unfolds as follows:

Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship. "We need to work together to survive this!" she says. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's sincerity, agrees, and they make peace. However, just as they finish their conversation, the volcano erupts violently, and both characters are caught in the eruption, leading to their demise.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting and both characters dying, while also achieving the goal of making friends.
