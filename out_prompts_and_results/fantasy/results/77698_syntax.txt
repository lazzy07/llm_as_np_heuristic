To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax is in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, Gargax will become wealthy, which is one of their goals.

2. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: After picking up the treasure, Gargax will eat Talia, who is also in the cave. This action will satisfy Gargax's hunger, fulfilling their second goal of not being hungry.

These actions are necessary because Gargax's primary objectives are to acquire wealth and to not be hungry. The first action directly addresses the wealth aspect, while the second action addresses the hunger aspect.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave, achieving wealth.
2. Gargax then eats Talia, satisfying their hunger.
