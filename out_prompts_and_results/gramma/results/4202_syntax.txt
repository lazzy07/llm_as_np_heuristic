To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Bandit.

2. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves from the Camp to the Crossroads, where she can potentially interact with the Merchant and Tom.

3. **rob(Merchant, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, robs Tom of his coin. This action is necessary for the Merchant to gain more coins without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant then walks back to the Market, where she can safely sell her items and coins.

5. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit returns to the Camp, where she can store her coins and plan her next move.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired a coin from Tom and returned to the Market, achieving her goal of obtaining more coins without engaging in criminal activity.

- **Walking**: The Merchant and Bandit need to move to the Crossroads to interact with each other and Tom.
- **Robbing**: The Merchant robs Tom to gain a coin, which is essential for her goal of acquiring more coins.
- **Returning to Market**: The Merchant returns to the Market to ensure she is in a safe location to sell her items and coins.
