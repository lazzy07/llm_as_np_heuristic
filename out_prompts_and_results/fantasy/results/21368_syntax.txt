To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the Cave where Talia is located. This is necessary because the treasure is in the Cave, and Vince needs to be there to access it.

2. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Vince's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the Village with the treasure. This is necessary to ensure he can interact with other characters and solidify his happiness.

4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince marries Talia in the Village. Since Talia has accepted his proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Vince's goal of happiness.

5. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is included to show that he is not currently hungry, but it sets the stage for the next action.

6. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to show the consequence of Vince's actions, but it does not affect his wealth or happiness before his death.

In this story, Vince successfully becomes wealthy by picking up the treasure and marries Talia, achieving happiness before the unfortunate end. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Vince, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)",
    "travel(Vince, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Vince, Talia, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Vince)",
    "eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Vince achieves his goals of happiness and wealth before the final action.
