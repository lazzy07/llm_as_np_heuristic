**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest realizes that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He decides to take the following actions:

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where Roy is and to potentially lock the bully in the gym.)
   
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest prevents the bully from coming out and threatening them further, ensuring their safety.)

3. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the kitchen.** (This action allows Ernest to access the kitchen where the knife is located without being seen by the bully.)

4. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (Having the knife is essential for Ernest to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)

5. **Ernest crawls back through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to return to the gym where Roy is, while still keeping the bully locked inside.)

6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Ernest and Roy can be safe.)

7. **Ernest and Roy put on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises them, allowing them to escape from the prison.)

8. **Ernest and Roy escape to the highway.** (This final action achieves their goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Ernest and Roy can eliminate the threat of the bully and escape the prison. Moving to the hallway and locking the gym door secures their immediate safety. Crawling through the vents allows them to avoid detection while obtaining the knife. Killing the bully removes the danger, and putting on civilian clothes enables their escape.
