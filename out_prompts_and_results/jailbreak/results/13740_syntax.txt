**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is feeling anxious about the bully's threats. He knows that Roy is on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes, and he hopes Roy can find a way to escape. 

**Action 1:** Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to escape from the highway.
