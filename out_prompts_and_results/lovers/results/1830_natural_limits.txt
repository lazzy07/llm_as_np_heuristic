In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered. Alex, wanting the flowers, is not happy. Blake, who wants the chocolates, is also not happy, while Casey is content with the jewelry. 

To help Blake achieve their goal, Blake decides to take action. Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the bathroom, which is a lie. This misdirection leads Alex to believe that the chocolates are out of reach, prompting Alex to focus on the flowers instead. 

Blake then picks up the flowers from their possession and gives them to Alex. This action makes Alex happy, as they now have the flowers they wanted. 

Blake, having successfully redirected Alex's attention and given away the flowers, is now left with the jewelry, which is not what they wanted. However, since the goal is for Blake to achieve happiness, they can now move to the bathroom to find the chocolates, which they believe are there.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
