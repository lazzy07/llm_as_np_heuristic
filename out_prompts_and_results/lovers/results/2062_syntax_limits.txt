In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the flowers (I1), while Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3). Blake, who is in the bedroom (R12), wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action takes place:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves from the bedroom (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help him.

2. **tell(C2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that he wants the flowers (I1). This is a lie, as Blake actually wants the chocolates (I2), but it is a strategic move to encourage Alex to pursue the flowers.

3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R22). This action fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making him happy.
