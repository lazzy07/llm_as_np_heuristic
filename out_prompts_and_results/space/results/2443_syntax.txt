To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe is in the cave and wants to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard. Since they are not currently fighting, this action allows them to become friends. This is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with other creatures.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe can safely walk to the surface where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to further solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe can again make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard.
