The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market and decides to take action. She approaches the guard and, without hesitation, attacks him. The guard, unarmed and caught off guard, falls to the ground. The bandit then loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword and any coins he might have had. With her newfound weapon and the guard's coins, she feels more secure in her criminal endeavors.

Now, with the guard out of the way, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins in the chest. She successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

3. **Walk to the bandit camp**: This final action secures her coins in a safe location, fulfilling her objective of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
