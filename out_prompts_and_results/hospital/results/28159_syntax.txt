To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial to ensure that both patients receive the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will make Ross healthy.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will make Young healthy.

5. **Walk Jones from Admissions to Exam Room C**: After treating the other two patients, Hathaway will walk Jones to Exam Room C to assess him.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis), ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, achieving the goal of making them healthy.
