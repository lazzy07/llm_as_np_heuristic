**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to escape. He puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.

Meanwhile, Ernest, still in the laundry room, is aware of the bully's threats. He decides to take a risk and moves to the hallway, hoping to find a way to help Roy or at least protect himself. This action is necessary for him to assess the situation outside the laundry room.

Once in the hallway, Ernest hears the sounds of the gym and knows the bully is still there. He decides to lock the gym door, preventing the bully from coming after him or Roy. This action is vital as it secures a temporary safe space for both him and Roy.
