To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe teleports from the Surface to the Ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the Surface is currently dangerous due to the volcano beginning to erupt. By teleporting to the Ship, she can avoid the imminent danger.

2. **Lizard walks from the Surface to the Cave**: The Lizard will move to the Cave to find a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps the Lizard maintain its health and safety.

3. **Zoe teleports from the Ship to the Cave**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe will teleport to the Cave to join the Lizard. This action is crucial for Zoe to continue building a friendship with the Lizard.

4. **Zoe and Lizard make peace in the Cave**: This action solidifies their friendship, as they are no longer fighting and are in the same location. It helps both characters achieve their goal of making friends.

5. **Lizard walks from the Cave to the Surface**: The Lizard will return to the Surface to ensure it is aware of the situation and can protect its territory. This action is taken to maintain its role as a guardian.

6. **Zoe teleports from the Cave to the Ship**: Zoe will teleport back to the Ship to ensure her safety again, as the Surface remains dangerous.

7. **Lizard walks back to the Cave**: The Lizard will return to the Cave to stay safe and continue to be a guardian in a secure location.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
