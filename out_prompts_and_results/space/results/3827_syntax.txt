To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship to avoid the danger of the volcano erupting, and then return to the surface to continue building a friendship with the Lizard.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the impending volcanic eruption. This action is necessary because the surface is currently dangerous.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface to continue her efforts to befriend the Lizard. This action is important to maintain the relationship and work towards their mutual goal of friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Finally, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship. This action is crucial as it directly aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

The actions taken ensure that Zoe avoids danger while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
