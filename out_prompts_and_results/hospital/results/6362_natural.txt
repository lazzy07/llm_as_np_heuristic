**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that there are still patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Young to an exam room. She walks from Patient Room A to Admissions and admits Young to Patient Room B. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to assess him correctly. She finds that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze. This reduces her workload back to 1.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. She finds that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him of Jarkis. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones. She finds that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved her goal.
