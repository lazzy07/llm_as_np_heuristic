To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the relationship between Talia and Rory, as Rory has proposed to Talia and is in possession of the treasure. The quickest way to make Talia happy is for her to accept Rory's proposal and get married, which will also make Rory happy. Since Talia does not care about being hungry, we can ignore the hunger aspect for this story.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling her desire to be happy.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures that both characters are happy.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the village to share the news of their marriage and possibly to acquire more wealth or resources, but this action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness.

After these actions, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Rory, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept**: This action is necessary for Talia to become happy, as it is the first step in solidifying her relationship with Rory.
- **marry**: This action completes the relationship and ensures both characters are happy, which is essential for Talia's goal.
- **travel**: While this action does not directly contribute to Talia's happiness, it can be seen as a way for Rory to further pursue wealth, which may indirectly benefit Talia in the future.
