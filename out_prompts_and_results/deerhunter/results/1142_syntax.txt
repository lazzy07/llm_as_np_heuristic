To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only obstacle between him and the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After acquiring the money, Bubba can go to the forest to find Bambi and eat her. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to both outcomes: Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk, and Bambi is dead after being eaten.
