Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway with a pack of cigarettes and a knife. He knows that Roy is still in the cell block and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to escape, Ernest decides to lock the gym door, preventing the bully from coming after them. 

After locking the gym, Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can safely escape from the prison. With the disguise on, he is no longer a target and can leave the prison behind.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **lock_gym(Ernest, Hall)**: This action is taken to secure the gym and prevent the bully from threatening or attacking either Ernest or Roy. It ensures that the bully is contained and cannot follow them.
2. **vent(Ernest, Highway)**: This action allows Ernest to escape through the vents to the highway, where he can leave the prison without being detected.

By taking these actions, Ernest achieves his goal of being alive and free, while also ensuring that Roy is safe from the bully.
