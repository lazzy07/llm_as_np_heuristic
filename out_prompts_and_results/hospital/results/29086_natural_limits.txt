Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, decides to assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is in Patient Room B, Hathaway can assess them without increasing their workload beyond the limit. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. This successfully makes Young healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room C, as Jones is still in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room.
