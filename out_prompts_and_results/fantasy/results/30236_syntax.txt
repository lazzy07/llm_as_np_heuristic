To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness and avoiding hunger. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for him to access the treasure.
   
2. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial as it allows him to become wealthy.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince returns to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for him to be in a location where he can interact with others and potentially share his wealth.

4. **propose(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince proposes to Talia. This action is taken because Talia is already married to Rory, and Vince's goal is to be happy, which can be achieved through a relationship.

6. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince and Talia get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures Vince's happiness.
