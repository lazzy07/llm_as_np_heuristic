To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Jones to Admissions**: After treatment, Jones will walk back to the admissions room to confirm their health status and ensure they are no longer in need of medical attention.

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to identify if they have Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This is essential for determining the correct treatment.
