To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to obtain the treasure located in the cave. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location where the treasure is located.

2. **Gargax eats Talia.**  
   - Gargax is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. Eating Talia also allows Gargax to take the treasure since Talia is at the cave and Gargax can take items from the dead body of a character.

3. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's body.**  
   - After eating Talia, Gargax can now take the treasure, which fulfills Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by obtaining the treasure) and is no longer hungry (after eating Talia).
