To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to obtain the medicine from the merchant and then return to the cottage. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Camp to Merchant**: Tom needs to get to the merchant to obtain the medicine.
2. **Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant using his coin**: Tom has a coin, and he can buy the medicine from the merchant, which is his goal.
3. **Tom walks from Merchant to Crossroads**: After obtaining the medicine, Tom needs to head towards the crossroads to continue his journey to the cottage.
4. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Camp, Merchant)**: This action is necessary for Tom to reach the merchant to buy the medicine.
- **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)**: This action allows Tom to acquire the medicine, which is essential for him to achieve his goal.
- **walk(Tom, Merchant, Crossroads)**: After obtaining the medicine, Tom needs to move towards the crossroads to continue his journey.
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This final action takes Tom to the cottage, completing his goal of being there with the medicine.
