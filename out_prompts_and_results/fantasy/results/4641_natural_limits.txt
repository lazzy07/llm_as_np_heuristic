2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's dead body.**  
   - After eating Talia, Gargax can take the treasure from her body since she is dead. This action increases Gargax's wealth, but it also means Talia will not achieve her goals of happiness or wealth.

- The third action is simply to return to his original location with the treasure, completing his goal.
