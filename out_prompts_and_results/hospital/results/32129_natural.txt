**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients waiting in Admissions, specifically Jones and Ross, who are both experiencing unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat him. This also keeps Dr. Hathaway's workload manageable.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**  
   - Similar to Jones, admitting Ross allows for assessment and treatment. This keeps the workflow efficient and ensures both patients are attended to.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, allowing for appropriate treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), this treatment will make him healthy. If he had Jarkis, this would be a mistake, but the goal is to ensure at least one patient is treated correctly.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross in Patient Room A.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis (rash), this treatment will make him healthy. If he had Flaze, this would be a mistake, but the goal is to ensure at least one patient is treated correctly.

10. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**  
    - This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but allows Dr. Hathaway to check on Young, who is still in Patient Room B.

11. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
    - This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

12. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze with antibiotics.**  
    - Assuming Young has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. If he had Jarkis, this would be a mistake, but the goal is to ensure at least one patient is treated correctly.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients effectively while managing their workload. The sequence allows for the treatment of all three patients, ensuring they all have the opportunity to become healthy. The assumption of symptoms is based on the need to treat patients correctly, and the actions taken are the most efficient way to achieve the goal of having all patients healthy.
