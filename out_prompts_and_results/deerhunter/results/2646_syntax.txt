To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, where the bank clerk is also present. The clerk has money, and Bubba is greedy, wanting to take it. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Bubba's greed for money.

2. **Decide to eat**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is included to address Bubba's hunger, which is a condition that has been established in the story.

3. **Eat**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to intimidate the clerk and takes the money. This fulfills his greed.
2. **Decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger and decides to eat.
3. **Eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba achieving his goal of acquiring money and addressing his hunger.
