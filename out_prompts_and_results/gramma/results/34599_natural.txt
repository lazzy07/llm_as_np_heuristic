To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit needs to be at the crossroads to interact with the other characters and potentially rob the merchant.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, who is armed, can rob the merchant, who is not armed. This allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, which is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - After robbing the merchant, the bandit will return to the safety of the bandit camp with the stolen coin.

4. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant needs to return to the crossroads to continue her business and potentially find more opportunities to earn coins.

5. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - The guard, who is at the crossroads, can report the bandit's location, which may lead to the bandit being pursued or distracted, allowing the merchant to operate without fear of being robbed again.

6. **The merchant buys a sword from the merchant using the hero's coin.**  
   - The merchant can now use the coin she has to buy a sword, which will help her defend herself in the future and potentially allow her to earn more coins by selling items.

By following this sequence of actions, the merchant successfully increases her wealth without engaging in criminal activity.
