Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano erupting.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard moves to the cave to find shelter from the potential eruption. This action is necessary for the Lizard to remain safe and healthy.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure they are both safe. This action is important for maintaining their friendship and for Zoe to fulfill her goal of making friends.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - The eruption is a natural event that occurs after Zoe has teleported back to the surface. However, since the Lizard is in the cave, it remains safe.

5. **Zoe walks to the cave.** - Zoe walks to the cave to join the Lizard. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they are together in a safe location.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they were already friends, this action solidifies their bond and mutual understanding, ensuring that they can work together in the future.

In this sequence of actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship. The Lizard successfully avoids the danger of the eruption by moving to the cave, while Zoe ensures her safety by teleporting and then joining the Lizard.
