To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can conclude the story with a single action that reinforces this outcome.

**Action:**
Bubba decides to eat Bambi.

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because it confirms that Bambi is dead and satisfies Bubba's hunger. It also aligns with Bubba's goal of having money, as he has already obtained it from the bank. By eating Bambi, Bubba is taking advantage of the situation, ensuring that he is not only satiated but also solidifying the fact that Bambi is no longer alive.

**Final Plan in JSON format:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["decide to eat"]
}
``` 

This plan succinctly concludes the story while meeting the requirements of the ending.
