Zoe and the Lizard are both on the surface of the planet, and the volcano has begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous for both of them. To achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to act quickly.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe initiates a peace agreement with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it solidifies their friendship and ensures that they are no longer enemies, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave. This action is important because it allows her to move to a safer location away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to also find safety and remain with Zoe, reinforcing their friendship.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the consequence of the earlier danger, but it does not affect Zoe and the Lizard since they are in a safe location.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also forming a friendship with the Lizard.
