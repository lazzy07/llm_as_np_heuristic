**Story Completion:**

As the tension in the gym escalates, Ernest and Roy realize they need to act quickly to avoid the bully's threats. 

1. **Ernest decides to sneak through the vents to the kitchen.** This action is necessary because the knife is located in the kitchen, and they need it to defend themselves against the bully.

2. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** This is crucial for Ernest to have a means of protection and a way to potentially get revenge on the bully.

3. **Ernest crawls back through the vents to the gym.** He needs to return to the gym to confront the bully and protect both himself and Roy.

4. **Ernest enters the gym with the knife.** This action allows him to confront the bully directly, as he now has the means to defend himself.

5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** This is the climax of the story, where Ernest overcomes the bully's threats and ensures that he and Roy are no longer in danger.

6. **Ernest and Roy put on the civilian clothes (which they had previously stolen but were confiscated).** This action is not included in the story since they do not have the clothes anymore, but if they had, it would allow them to disguise themselves for an escape.

7. **Ernest and Roy escape through the hallway to the highway.** This would be the final action if they had the civilian clothes, but since they do not, the story ends with Ernest having killed the bully, ensuring their safety.
