To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (the flowers). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **put_down(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story consistent with the characters' actions and desires.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21). This action allows Blake to be present in the same room as Alex and Casey, which is important for the social dynamics of the story.

5. **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Blake. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but could be a gesture of goodwill, as Alex wants Blake to be happy too.

After these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, fulfilling their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **put_down(C3, I2, R21)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it maintains the flow of the story.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake's presence in the living room allows for potential interactions and trades.
- **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: This action shows Alex's generosity and desire for Blake's happiness, even though it doesn't affect Alex's happiness directly.
