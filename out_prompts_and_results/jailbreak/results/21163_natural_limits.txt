As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Roy knows he has to act quickly to protect himself and Ernest. He quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen, ready to confront the bully. 

With a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, surprised and unable to react in time, is overpowered by Roy. In a desperate struggle, Roy manages to stab the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten him or Ernest.
