To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her marrying one of the suitors and acquiring wealth. Since both Rory and Vince have proposed to Talia, she can choose to accept one of their proposals. Given that Talia wants to be wealthy, she should marry Vince, who currently possesses money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal. This action is necessary for Talia to become happy, as accepting a proposal leads to happiness for both characters.
   
2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This solidifies Talia's happiness and fulfills her desire for a relationship.

3. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Village)**: Vince can take the money from himself (since he has it). This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy, as she will now have access to the money.

Now, Talia is happy because she is married to Vince, and she is wealthy because she has the money.
