To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will help him secure wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to retrieve the treasure he picked up earlier. This is necessary for him to secure his wealth.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the treasure. This is important as he needs to be in the village to interact with Talia and Vince.

3. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money from Vince. This action is crucial for Rory to increase his wealth.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia accepted his proposal earlier, this action will make both of them happy.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that he is not currently hungry, but it sets up the next action.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to show that Rory's life ends, but it is not necessary for Rory to achieve his goal since he has already secured wealth and happiness through marriage.

In this story, Rory achieves his goal of being happy and wealthy through marriage to Talia and acquiring both treasure and money. The ending with Gargax eating Rory is not necessary for Rory's goal but serves as a dramatic conclusion.
