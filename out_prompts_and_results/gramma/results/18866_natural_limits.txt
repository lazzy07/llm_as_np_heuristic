Tom, at the crossroads, sees the bandit standing nearby. Knowing that he is unarmed and the bandit is a threat, he decides to take a risk. He quickly reports the bandit's location to the guard, who is at the market. The guard, alerted by Tom's report, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

Upon arriving, the guard draws his sword and attacks the bandit, who is unable to defend herself since she is not armed. The bandit falls, and the guard loots her sword and the coins from the chest. With the bandit defeated, Tom is now safe to return to the cottage carrying the medicine he purchased earlier.
