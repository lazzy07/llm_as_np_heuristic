To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: Tom will use his sword to rob the Merchant, taking the medicine she is carrying. This is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is essential for Tom to reach his desired location.

The Bandit will not take any actions that would interfere with Tom's goal since her focus is on acquiring coins, and the Merchant will not act against Tom as she is not a criminal and is not in immediate danger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This action is crucial for Tom to obtain the medicine, which is currently with the Merchant. Since Tom is armed and the Merchant is not, he can successfully take the medicine without facing any consequences.
- **Walking to the Cottage**: This action allows Tom to reach his goal location with the medicine in hand.
