Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Ross and Young to exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room A.** This action is necessary because Ross is experiencing Fever, which indicates he has Flaze. By admitting him to an exam room, Hathaway can assess and treat him.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B.** Young is experiencing Rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Admitting him allows Hathaway to assess and treat him as well.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A.** This action is crucial for Hathaway to confirm that Ross is indeed experiencing Fever, which is a symptom of Flaze.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Exam Room A with antibiotics.** Since Ross has Fever, treating him with antibiotics will cure him of Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B.** This action confirms that Young is experiencing Rash, which is a symptom of Jarkis.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Exam Room B with steroids.** Since Young has Rash, treating him with steroids will cure him of Jarkis, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
