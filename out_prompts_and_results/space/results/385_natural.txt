Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that she needs to establish a relationship with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. Since they are not currently fighting, Zoe decides to take a peaceful approach.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and be safe. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the erupting volcano.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the erupting surface. The cave can provide shelter from the volcanic activity.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard work together in the cave.** While this action is implied rather than explicitly stated, it represents their newfound friendship and collaboration to ensure their health and safety. They can discuss ways to prevent future eruptions or find a way to signal for help.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
