To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Young as well. This will help to identify Young's symptoms and ensure that both patients are evaluated.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is still in the admissions room, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, and it will make Jones healthy.

5. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is also diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics as well. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy too.

6. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, leading to their health and achieving Hathaway's goal.
