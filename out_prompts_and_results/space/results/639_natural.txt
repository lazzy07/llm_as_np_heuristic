Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard. She believes that if she can reach the Lizard, they can work together to escape the danger. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and potentially help him, as she believes they can become friends.)
   
Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard struggling to find safety from the erupting volcano. The Lizard, initially wary of Zoe, recognizes her intention to help.

2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** (This action is necessary to approach the Lizard and show her willingness to assist him.)

As Zoe approaches, the Lizard realizes that Zoe is not a threat and that they share a common goal of survival.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** (This action is necessary for them to become friends, as they are no longer fighting and can now cooperate.)

With their newfound friendship, they work together to find a safe place away from the volcano. However, the volcano erupts suddenly, and they must act quickly.

4. **The volcano erupts.** (This event is necessary to fulfill the condition of the story where a character dies.)

In the chaos, the Lizard pushes Zoe out of the way of a falling rock but is struck himself, leading to his demise. Zoe, devastated but grateful for the Lizard's sacrifice, vows to remember him as a friend.

The story ends with Zoe mourning the Lizard, having made a friend in the process, but also experiencing loss due to the eruption.
