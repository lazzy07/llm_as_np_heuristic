To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) can trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Alex (C1) wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to get the item they desire, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will still be happy because they helped Alex.
- Casey will still have the flowers (I3) and will be happy as well.

This single trade action is sufficient to ensure Alex's happiness.
