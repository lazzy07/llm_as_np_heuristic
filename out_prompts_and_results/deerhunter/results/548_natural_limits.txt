Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, decides to take action. He points the rifle at the bank clerk, who is startled but remains calm. Bubba demands the clerk's money. The clerk, seeing the loaded rifle, hands over the 1 money without resistance. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not taken because it is unnecessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. Instead, he uses intimidation.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is implied when Bubba demands the money, and the clerk willingly hands it over due to the threat of the rifle.
3. **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is not taken in the final story as Bubba's primary goal is to obtain money, and he can eat later.

The story is concise, with Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining 1 money from the clerk without unnecessary violence.
