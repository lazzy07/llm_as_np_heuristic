**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make Ross healthy. This is a critical step to ensure that at least one patient is treated successfully.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess the other patients, specifically Young, who is still in Admissions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to assign Young to an exam room so that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat Young.

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to be in the same room as Young to assess and treat them.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), this treatment will make Young healthy. 

At this point, both Ross and Young are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat the patients effectively without exceeding the workload limit that could lead to mistakes.
- The sequence of actions is designed to maximize the number of patients treated successfully while minimizing the risk of error.
