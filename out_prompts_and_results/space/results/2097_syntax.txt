To complete the story, we will have Zoe teleport to the surface, where she will encounter the Lizard. Since the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and is currently in a dangerous situation, Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action will help them both achieve their goals of being healthy and safe, and it will also allow them to become friends. However, while they are on the surface, the volcano will erupt, leading to the Lizard's demise. This fulfills the requirement of having a character die while also allowing for the friendship to be established before the tragic event.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to meet the Lizard and attempt to make peace.
2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard on the surface**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship.
3. **The volcano erupts on the surface**: This action leads to the Lizard's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

The story ends with Zoe and the Lizard having made peace, but the eruption of the volcano results in the Lizard's demise.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe needs to be on the surface to interact with the Lizard.
- **Make Peace**: This action is crucial for establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with their goals.
- **Erupt**: The eruption of the volcano is a necessary event that leads to the Lizard's death, fulfilling the story's requirements.
