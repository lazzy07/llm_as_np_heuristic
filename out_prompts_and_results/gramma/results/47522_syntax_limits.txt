In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Cottage, and the Bandit has a sword, which allows her to rob others. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will walk to the Crossroads and then rob the Merchant, who is also at the Crossroads. The Merchant is armed but does not have a sword, making her vulnerable to being robbed. The Bandit will take the TomCoin from the Merchant.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to go back to the camp, thus achieving her goal of carrying more coins.

Here’s the complete story:

- The Bandit walks from the Cottage to the Crossroads.
- At the Crossroads, the Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the TomCoin.

After this action, the Bandit has successfully acquired a coin, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
