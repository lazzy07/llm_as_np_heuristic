To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the chocolates (I3). The current situation shows that Alex is in the living room (R22) and the chocolates are also in the living room. Since Alex is already in the same room as the chocolates, the simplest action for Alex to take is to pick up the chocolates.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the chocolates from the living room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the chocolates, which is what they wanted.
