Blake, wanting to be happy and also wanting Alex to be happy, decides to take action. 

1. Blake moves from the living room to the dining room to get the chocolates. (This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness, as they want the chocolates.)
2. Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room. (This action allows Blake to obtain the item they desire.)
3. Blake moves back to the living room with the chocolates. (Blake needs to return to the living room to interact with Alex and Casey.)
4. Blake gives the chocolates to Alex in the living room. (This action helps Alex to become happy, which is important to Blake.)
5. Alex, now happy with the chocolates, gives the flowers to Blake. (This action allows Blake to also become happy, as they want the chocolates but now have the flowers instead.)
6. Blake puts down the flowers in the living room. (This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but is a logical step after receiving the flowers.)
