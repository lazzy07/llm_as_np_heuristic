In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. Both characters are currently safe but aware of the danger surrounding them. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also allowing for the possibility of friendship, the following actions will take place:

1. **Erupt the volcano**: This action will cause the volcano to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface.
2. **Kill Zoe**: Since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she will die as a result of the eruption.

After the eruption, the Lizard, who is also on the surface, will be left alone. However, the Lizard will reflect on the situation and realize that Zoe, despite their differences, was a brave explorer. This realization will lead the Lizard to feel a sense of camaraderie with Zoe, even in death, thus establishing a form of friendship posthumously.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which is a key event in the story.
2. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action occurs as a consequence of the eruption, resulting in Zoe's death. The Lizard, while not directly responsible for Zoe's death, will feel a connection to her bravery and desire for friendship.

The final outcome is that the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the Lizard reflects on their encounter, leading to a sense of friendship.
