1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary for her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for building a friendship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action brings her closer to the Lizard, allowing for potential interaction.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk to the surface, where Zoe is. This action is necessary for them to meet and interact.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, as both characters are not fighting and are in the same location.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk back to the cave with the Lizard. This action allows them to be in a safe place together, away from the dangers of the surface.

6. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will again attempt to make peace with the Lizard in the cave. This reinforces their friendship and ensures both characters feel safe and healthy.
