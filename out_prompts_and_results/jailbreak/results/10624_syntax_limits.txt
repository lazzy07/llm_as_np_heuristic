**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest is feeling threatened by the bully, who is currently in the gym. Meanwhile, Roy, who has just stolen a knife from the kitchen, is in the hallway. Knowing that the bully poses a significant threat to both of them, Roy decides to take action.

Roy moves to the gym and locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot escape and will not be able to threaten them further. With the bully now cornered, Roy uses the knife he stole to kill the bully, eliminating the threat once and for all.
