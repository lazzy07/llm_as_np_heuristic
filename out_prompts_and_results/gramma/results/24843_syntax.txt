To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely return to the cottage without being hindered by the other characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks directly from the crossroads to the cottage, carrying the medicine. This action is necessary as it takes Tom to his desired location with the item he wants.

This single action is sufficient for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's journey, and since he is not a criminal, he can move freely.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to reach his goal location (the cottage) while carrying the medicine. Since there are no obstacles or threats in this scenario, it is the most efficient way for Tom to achieve his objective.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
