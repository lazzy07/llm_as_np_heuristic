To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface, where the volcano is located. This action is necessary to ensure that the Lizard is present when the volcano erupts.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is crucial as it leads to the death of the Lizard, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Before the Lizard is affected by the eruption, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is important because it allows them to become friends, despite the impending danger.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard dies due to the eruption. This action is included to explicitly state the consequence of the eruption on the Lizard.

The sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard making peace, thus becoming friends.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: This action is necessary to bring the Lizard back to the surface where the volcano is located.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the Lizard's death.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends before the eruption takes place.
- **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: This action confirms the Lizard's death due to the eruption.
