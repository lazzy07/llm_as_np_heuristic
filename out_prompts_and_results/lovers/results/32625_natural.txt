To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give away the flowers.

2. **Casey gives flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers, which is what Alex wants to be happy.

3. **Alex is now happy.**  
   - With the flowers in hand, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

The actions are minimal and directly lead to Alex's happiness by ensuring that Casey, who has the flowers, is able to give them to Alex.
