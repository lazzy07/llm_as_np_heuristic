To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to the item they want (jewelry) and to interact with Casey and Blake.
2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to follow Alex and be part of the interaction.
3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to join Alex and Casey.
4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is a strategic move to make Alex feel appreciated and happy, as it builds goodwill.
5. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake. This is a necessary step to ensure that Blake has something to offer back to Alex.
6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) back to Alex. Now Alex has the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
