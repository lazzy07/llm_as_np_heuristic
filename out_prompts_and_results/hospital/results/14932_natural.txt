**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis (the rash symptom). 

2. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross does not actually have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

3. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room C to assess Jones.

4. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is still in Admissions. She mistakenly believes Jones is alive and does not realize he is experiencing an unknown condition.

5. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Jones does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young.

7. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. She mistakenly believes Young is alive.

8. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Young does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.
