To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the cave. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving her goal but helps to ensure that she is safe from the erupting volcano.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship from the cave. This action ensures her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
