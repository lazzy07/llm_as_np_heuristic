**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomC and assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with steroids, as he believes Ross has Jarkis (the only disease that matches the symptom of a rash). This action is crucial because it directly addresses Ross's health issue, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Young, who has not yet been assigned to an exam room. This action is important to determine Young's symptoms and ensure that he also receives the appropriate treatment.

4. **Admit Young**: Hathaway admits Young to PatientRoomB, allowing for a future assessment and treatment. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is not left untreated.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: This is the first step to identify Ross's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment.
- **Treat Ross**: This action is essential to ensure Ross's health and fulfill Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and ensure he is not overlooked.
- **Admit Young**: This action prepares Young for future treatment, ensuring he is part of the care process.
