**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the gym with the bully, who is currently preoccupied with his own workout. Knowing that the bully has threatened both him and Roy, Ernest decides to take a bold step. He quickly steals the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously eyed for self-defense. 

With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully in the gym. The bully, caught off guard, tries to intimidate Ernest, but Ernest, fueled by the need to protect himself and his friend Roy, takes decisive action. He kills the bully with the knife, finally overcoming the threat that loomed over both him and Roy.

With the bully dead, Ernest feels a rush of relief. He knows that he must escape the prison before the guards arrive. He quickly moves to the hallway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier. Disguised and ready, he crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison, successfully escaping.
