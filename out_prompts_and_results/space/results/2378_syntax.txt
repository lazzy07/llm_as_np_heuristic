To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard take actions that lead to the volcano erupting, while also ensuring they become friends. The goal is to create a scenario where the volcano erupts, and one character dies, but they also manage to establish a friendship before that happens.

1. **Zoe and Lizard are in the Cave**: They are currently not fighting and have a friendly relationship (relationship level 1). This means they can take actions to strengthen their bond.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Although they are already not fighting, this action will reinforce their friendship. This is important because it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

3. **Zoe walks to the Surface**: Zoe needs to be on the Surface for the volcano to erupt. This action is necessary to transition to the location where the eruption can occur.

4. **The volcano begins to erupt**: This action will trigger the eruption, creating a dangerous situation.

5. **Zoe is on the Surface when the volcano erupts**: Since Zoe is on the Surface when the volcano erupts, she will die as a result of the eruption.

The final sequence of actions will ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while also establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action solidifies their friendship, which is a goal for both characters.
