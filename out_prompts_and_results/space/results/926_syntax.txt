To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

2. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: After making peace, Zoe needs to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary for her to be healthy and safe.

3. **Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard will move to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being healthy and safe.

4. **Lizard waits in the cave**: The Lizard will remain in the cave until the volcano finishes erupting, ensuring its safety.

5. **Volcano erupts**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are in safe locations (Zoe in the spaceship and Lizard in the cave), they remain healthy and safe.

By following these actions, both characters achieve their goals without conflict.
