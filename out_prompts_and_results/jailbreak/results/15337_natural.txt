Ernest, armed with the knife, sneaks up on the bully in the gym. He knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Roy, and he cannot let that continue. With a swift motion, he uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer in danger. 

After the confrontation, Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then leaves the gym and heads to the hallway.
