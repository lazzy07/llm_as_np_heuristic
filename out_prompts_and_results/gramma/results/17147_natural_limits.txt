To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit is currently at the cottage and needs to leave to allow Tom to safely return to the cottage without encountering her.

2. **The hero walks from the cottage to the market and buys the medicine from the merchant using the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows Tom to acquire the medicine, which is currently with the merchant at the market. Since the bandit has left the cottage, Tom can safely walk to the market, buy the medicine, and then return to the cottage.

After these actions, Tom will be at the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling the goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action ensures that the bandit is no longer at the cottage, allowing Tom to return without danger.
- The second action allows Tom to obtain the medicine, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
