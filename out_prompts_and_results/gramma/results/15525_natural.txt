The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, now stands at the market with the merchant's sword in hand. The guard is also present at the market, armed and ready to protect the innocent. The bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. 

To achieve this, the bandit will take the following actions:

1. **Rob the Guard**: The bandit, armed with the merchant's sword, will attempt to rob the guard. Since the guard is not armed with a sword, the bandit can take one of the items the guard is carrying. The guard has a sword, which the bandit will take.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the guard, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This allows the bandit to secure the stolen sword and any coins in the chest at the camp.

3. **Loot the Chest**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit will loot the chest to collect the coins stored there. This action fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The actions are necessary to ensure the bandit achieves her goal of acquiring coins, either by robbing the guard or by securing the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
