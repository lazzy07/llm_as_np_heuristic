To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Jones, the first step is to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever (Flaze), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If Jones has a rash (Jarkis), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Next, Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomC to assess Ross. This is necessary because Ross is currently assigned to PatientRoomC, and Hathaway needs to check Ross's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Young. This is necessary because Young is currently in Admissions, and Hathaway needs to check Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
