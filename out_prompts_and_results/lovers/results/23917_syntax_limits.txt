In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) that is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to get the jewelry from Casey. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3) and will still want the flowers (I2), but Alex's goal of being happy is achieved.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex gets what they want (the jewelry) while also allowing Casey to receive something in return (the chocolates). This satisfies both characters' desires for happiness through a mutually beneficial exchange.
