**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. He knows that Roy is in the gym with the bully, who is threatening both of them. To ensure their safety and achieve his goal of staying alive and having a pack of cigarettes, Ernest decides to take action.

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Ernest to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, ensuring he can help Roy without being threatened.)
   
2. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (This action allows Roy to escape the gym and join Ernest in the hallway, reducing the threat from the bully.)

3. **Roy and Ernest both escape to the highway.** (Now that they are both together and outside the gym, they can make their way to the highway.)

4. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (Ernest is already disguised, but this action ensures that both of them are ready to escape.)

5. **Ernest and Roy escape from the prison.** (With both characters disguised and on the highway, they can successfully escape from the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Crawling through the vents allows Ernest to avoid confrontation with the bully while still reaching Roy.
- Unlocking the gym door gives Roy a chance to escape the bully's threats.
- Escaping to the highway is the ultimate goal, as it leads to freedom.
- Putting on civilian clothes is crucial for disguising themselves from the guards.
- The final escape action is necessary to achieve Ernest's goal of being alive and free.
