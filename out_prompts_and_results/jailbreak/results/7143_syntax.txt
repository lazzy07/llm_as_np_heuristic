**Story Completion:**

After venting to the highway, Roy is now outside the prison. He knows that he needs to disguise himself to avoid being caught by the guards. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. With the disguise on, he feels more secure and ready to escape.

**Actions Taken:**
1. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself, which is necessary for him to avoid detection by the guards and successfully escape from the prison.

2. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: With the disguise on, Roy escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial because without the disguise, Roy would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would likely be caught by the guards. The disguise allows him to blend in and increases his chances of escaping successfully.
- The second action is the culmination of his efforts. By escaping, Roy ensures his survival and freedom, which aligns with his goal of wanting to be alive and not threatened.
