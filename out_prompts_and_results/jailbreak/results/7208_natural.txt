**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, stands on the highway, feeling a mix of fear and excitement. He knows he must act quickly to escape the prison before the bully can find him.

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym and potentially lock the bully inside.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape and is trapped inside, reducing the threat to both him and Roy.)
3. **Ernest sneaks through the vents back to the highway.** (This action allows Ernest to return to safety while the bully is locked in the gym.)
4. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (Although he is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise and prepares him for the escape.)
5. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise and the bully locked away, Ernest can safely leave the prison and achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the hallway is essential for Ernest to access the gym and lock the bully inside, ensuring his safety.
- Locking the gym door is a strategic move to neutralize the bully's threat, allowing Ernest to focus on his escape.
- Sneaking through the vents back to the highway keeps Ernest out of sight and away from any potential confrontation with the bully or guards.
- Putting on the civilian clothes is a precautionary measure to ensure he is fully disguised for his escape.
- Escaping from the prison is the ultimate goal, allowing Ernest to be alive and free, fulfilling his desires.
