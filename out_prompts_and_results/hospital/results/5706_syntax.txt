To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is already in PatientRoomA with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has SymptomB (which we assume is a rash indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed or treated, we will walk Young to Exam Room C. This action is not directly related to Ross's goal but is necessary to ensure all patients are accounted for and treated.

4. **Assess Young**: After walking Young to Exam Room C, Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young also receives the appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This ensures that all patients are healthy, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Ross**: This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy based on the assessment.
3. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to move Young to a treatment area.
4. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms for appropriate treatment.
5. **Treat Young**: This action ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy while also addressing the needs of the other patient, Young.
