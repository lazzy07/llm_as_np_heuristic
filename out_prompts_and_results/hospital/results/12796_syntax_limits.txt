**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is in the admissions room with Jones and Young. Ross is currently in exam room B. Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway walks to exam room B to assess Ross. This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway realizes that Ross has the same symptom as Jones (SymptomA), which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze.

After these actions, Ross is now healthy and has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Ross**: This is crucial for Hathaway to understand what disease Ross has and to avoid any mistakes in treatment.
- **Treating Ross**: By administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze), Hathaway ensures that Ross recovers and achieves his goal of being healthy.
