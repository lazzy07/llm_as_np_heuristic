**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, SymptomA, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, as Hathaway needs to know the correct treatment to ensure all patients are healthy.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway determines that he has Flaze (fever) and treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Jones's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in Exam Room C. Since Ross has SymptomA, which is a rash, Hathaway needs to confirm the diagnosis to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomC**: Finally, Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis (rash). This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.
