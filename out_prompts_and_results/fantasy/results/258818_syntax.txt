To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted marriage proposals from both Vince and Rory. However, to maximize her happiness, she should marry one of them.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia chooses to marry Vince. This action will make both Talia and Vince happy, as they both want to be happy and Talia has accepted Vince's proposal. 

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is also in the cave, will eat Rory. This action is necessary because Rory is a competitor for Talia's affections and wealth. By removing him from the story, Talia can focus on her new marriage with Vince without any rivalry.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: After marrying Talia, Vince can travel back to the village with Talia, where they can start their new life together.

At the end of these actions, Talia will be married to Vince, which will make her happy, and she will retain her treasure, ensuring she is wealthy.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage, and since Vince also wants to be happy, it benefits both characters.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action eliminates Rory, who poses a threat to Talia's happiness and wealth, allowing her to focus on her relationship with Vince.
- **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: This action signifies the beginning of Talia and Vince's new life together, reinforcing their happiness and stability.
