To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has the same symptom as Jones (SymptomA), Hathaway should assess Ross to determine his condition. This is necessary to ensure that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for SymptomA, which is antibiotics (since SymptomA corresponds to Flaze). This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in the admissions room and has a different symptom (SymptomB). This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Young.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomB, which is steroids (since SymptomB corresponds to Jarkis). This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring they are healthy.
