Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger surrounding her. The Lizard, the guardian of the surface, is also present, and both characters are healthy but not safe. To achieve their goals of safety and friendship, they need to find common ground.

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to initiate a conversation and establish a connection with the Lizard, which is essential for making friends.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - By choosing to make peace, Zoe expresses her desire for friendship and safety, which aligns with both characters' goals. This action transforms their relationship from enemies to friends.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - Moving to the cave provides a safer environment away from the dangers of the surface, allowing both characters to feel secure and continue building their friendship.

4. **The Lizard and Zoe stay in the cave until the volcano erupts.** - By remaining in the cave, they avoid the eruption on the surface, ensuring their safety.

Through these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
