**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation. She looks at the guard and sees that he is focused on the hero and the merchant. The bandit then swiftly attacks the guard, killing him before he can react. 

With the guard now dead, the bandit loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword. Now armed with two swords, the bandit feels confident. She then walks back to the bandit camp, carrying the medicine she bought from the merchant and the coins she has in her chest.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Bandit attacks the guard**: The bandit wants to eliminate the guard, who poses a threat to her freedom and ability to carry coins. Since the guard is not armed (he is dead), the bandit can attack without fear of retaliation.
   
2. **Bandit loots the guard's corpse**: After killing the guard, the bandit takes his sword, which increases her power and security against any future threats.

3. **Bandit walks to the bandit camp**: The bandit prefers to be at the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins and the medicine she acquired. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
