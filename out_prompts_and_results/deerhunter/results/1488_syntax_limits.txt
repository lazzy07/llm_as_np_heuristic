To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he has just eaten Bambi and head to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and potentially acquire the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba's greed is satisfied, and he decides to keep the money for himself. This action confirms that Bubba has achieved his goal of having money.

The actions taken are necessary to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is dead, as he has already eaten her.
