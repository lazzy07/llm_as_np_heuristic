To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and since Rory is at the cave, Gargax can do this. By eating Rory, Gargax will become wealthy (by taking the treasure Rory has) and not hungry, which aligns with Gargax's goals.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve wealth.

3. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince will travel to the cave to confront Gargax and potentially retrieve the money he has, as he is not aware of Rory's fate yet.

4. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax will then eat Vince, which will further ensure Gargax's wealth and satisfy Gargax's hunger.

5. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money from Vince's dead body, completing Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

At the end of these actions, Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry is not achieved directly, but Gargax's actions lead to a situation where Rory's happiness is indirectly fulfilled through the chaos that ensues. However, since the goal is to ensure Rory achieves their goal, we can conclude that Rory's happiness is not achieved in this scenario.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Rory",
    "Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body",
    "Vince travels from the village to the cave",
    "Gargax eats Vince",
    "Gargax takes the money from Vince's body"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan outlines the necessary actions taken to achieve the goals of the characters involved, particularly focusing on Gargax's actions that lead to the fulfillment of wealth and hunger satisfaction.
