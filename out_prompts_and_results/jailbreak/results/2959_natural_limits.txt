**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the hallway, he knows he must act quickly to help his friend Ernest. He decides to sneak through the vents to the gym, where he believes the bully is threatening Ernest. 

Once in the gym, Roy sees the bully looming over Ernest, who looks terrified. With the knife he stole from the kitchen, Roy takes a deep breath and lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. In a swift motion, he stabs the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully dead, Roy helps Ernest to his feet. They quickly decide to escape together. They leave the gym and head to the laundry room, where they find the civilian clothes. They put on the clothes to disguise themselves. 

Now disguised, they make their way to the hallway and crawl through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once they reach the highway, they successfully escape, leaving the prison behind.
