To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the camp and walks to the crossroads to be closer to the market where Tom is located.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit continues to the market, where Tom is currently located. This is necessary for the bandit to confront Tom and potentially rob him.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the camp to secure the coins in the chest.

5. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from Tom and places them in the chest at the camp, achieving her goal of having as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit needs to move from the camp to the crossroads and then to the market to confront Tom, who is carrying coins.
- Robbing Tom is essential for the bandit to acquire coins since Tom is unarmed and vulnerable.
- Returning to the camp allows the bandit to secure the stolen coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal.
