To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently in the dining room (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Alex to access the item they want.
2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.
3. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry in the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to allow for a potential trade or give action later.
4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to check on Alex and see if they can help. This action is necessary for Blake to be involved in the next steps.
5. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry that Alex put down. This action allows Blake to facilitate Alex's happiness.
6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex achieves their goal of being happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy.

- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to move to assist Alex, showing their desire to help.
- **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry to give it to Alex, facilitating Alex's happiness.
