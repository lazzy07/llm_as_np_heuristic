To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Currently, Alex is in the dining room (R12) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey has it in the living room (R21). 

The simplest action to achieve this is for Alex to trade with Casey. Since Alex wants the jewelry and Casey wants the chocolates (I2), they can trade their items. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) trades the flowers (I3) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it directly allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will be happy since they wanted to trade.

Now, Alex has achieved their goal of being happy.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex gets the jewelry they want. It directly addresses Alex's desire and leads to their happiness.
