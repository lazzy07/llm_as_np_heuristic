Zoe and the Lizard, having made peace in the cave, realize that the volcano on the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous. They both want to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet. However, they also want to become friends and work together to face the impending eruption.

1. **Erupt the volcano**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to let the volcano erupt, as they believe it is a natural part of the planet's cycle. They understand that they need to embrace the planet's nature rather than fight against it. This action will lead to the eruption, which is a significant event in the story.

2. **Teleport to the ship**: Zoe teleports to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the eruption. The Lizard, however, remains on the surface, feeling a connection to the planet and wanting to protect it.

Through these actions, Zoe and the Lizard achieve a bond of friendship before the eruption, even though the Lizard ultimately sacrifices itself for the planet.
