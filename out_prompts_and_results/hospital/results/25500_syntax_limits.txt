To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Since Young is currently in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing Young's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, if they show symptoms of Jarkis (which is a rash), Hathaway can treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Young has Jarkis or Flaze, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomB)**: If Young is found to have Jarkis, Hathaway treats them with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment. This action ensures that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome of all patients being healthy, while keeping the number of actions minimal.
