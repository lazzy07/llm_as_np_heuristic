To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to make peace with the Lizard, ensuring they are no longer fighting and can work together to find safety.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is taken to solidify their friendship. Since they are already in a non-fighting state and have a positive relationship, this action will help them both feel safe and secure.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can walk together to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave, ensuring they both reach safety together.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts after they have moved to the cave, which would have been dangerous if they were still on the surface.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace**: Establishes a friendship, which is crucial for both characters to feel safe and secure.
- **walk**: Moves both characters to a safer location (the cave) away from the danger of the volcano.
- **erupt**: This action is included to show the consequence of the volcano erupting, but since Zoe and the Lizard are already in the cave, they are safe.
