Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Dr. Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating they have Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Since Ross is still in Admissions, Dr. Hathaway can assign him to an exam room without increasing the workload further. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. After assessing, Dr. Hathaway finds that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Ross healthy.
