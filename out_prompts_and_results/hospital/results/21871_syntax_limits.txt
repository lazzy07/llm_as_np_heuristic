In the current situation, Hathaway has a workload of 2 and is in Patient Room C with both Jones and Ross. Young is in the admissions room. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, or if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

Since Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, and both Jones and Young are still in the admissions room, Hathaway can focus on Ross first. 

Hereâ€™s the complete story:

Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. After identifying that Ross has a fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics for Flaze, successfully making him healthy.

**JSON Object:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)", "treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all patients healthy by focusing on one patient at a time, starting with Ross.
