To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest to find Bambi, who he can shoot for food. This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After finding Bambi, Bubba returns to the Bank to confront the Clerk. This action is necessary to execute his plan to steal money from the Clerk.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the Clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba goes back to the Forest after stealing the money. This action is necessary for him to escape the scene.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his need for food.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba first addresses his hunger by going to the Forest, then returns to the Bank to steal money from the Clerk, and finally, he eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
