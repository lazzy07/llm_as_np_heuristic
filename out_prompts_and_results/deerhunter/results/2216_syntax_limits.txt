To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's greed and his desire for money. The simplest way to achieve this is for Bubba to go back to the bank and steal the money from the bank clerk, who is still alive and has the money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to return to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded and in his possession, Bubba can now threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action fulfills Bubba's greed and ensures he has the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already confirmed dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.
