Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she looks at the Lizard, who is also on the surface. They have just made peace, but the danger of the environment looms over them. Zoe knows that to ensure both of their safety and to foster a friendship, they need to find a safer place.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard has been. This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the dangers of the surface, which is currently unstable.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can further solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it helps both characters achieve their goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship from the cave. This action ensures her safety and allows her to continue her exploration, knowing that she has made a friend on the planet.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
