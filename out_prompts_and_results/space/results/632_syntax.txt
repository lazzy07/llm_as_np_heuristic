To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard interact in a way that leads to the volcano erupting and ultimately results in one character dying while the other makes peace. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.**  
   - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and understand the situation on the surface, where the volcano is active.

2. **Zoe begins to make peace with the Lizard.**  
   - Since Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, this action is crucial. It shows her intention to establish a friendly relationship rather than engage in conflict.

3. **The volcano erupts.**  
   - This event is triggered by the ongoing danger of the volcano, which has been established in the story. The eruption will create a critical situation that tests the characters' relationship.

4. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This outcome fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption, which is a direct consequence of the volcano erupting.

5. **The Lizard mourns Zoe and reflects on their brief friendship.**  
   - Although Zoe dies, the Lizard recognizes the potential for friendship they had, leading to a sense of connection and understanding.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard acknowledges their relationship, thus making peace in a way.
