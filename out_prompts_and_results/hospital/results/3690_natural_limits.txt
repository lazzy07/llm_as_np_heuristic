Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to assess Jones, who is assigned to Patient Room A but is actually in Patient Room C. Since Dr. Hathaway believes Jones is in Patient Room C, she mistakenly assesses Young instead. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, but Dr. Hathaway, unaware of the mix-up, treats Young with antibiotics, believing they have Flaze. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. After admitting Ross, Dr. Hathaway goes back to Patient Room A to assess Jones. This time, she correctly assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still low, she correctly identifies that Jones is alive and treats him with antibiotics for Flaze, which is the correct treatment. Jones becomes healthy.

In the end, Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, while Young unfortunately does not.
