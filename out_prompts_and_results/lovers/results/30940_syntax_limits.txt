In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1), Casey (C2) wants the chocolates (I2), and Blake (C3) wants Alex to be happy. Since Alex is currently unhappy, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the jewelry.

1. **Action: trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R12)** - Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Alex for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to receive the item they want, which is the jewelry, thus making Alex happy. 

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex (C1) is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C2) is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake (C3) is happy because they have made Alex happy.

This single action achieves Blake's goal of making Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
