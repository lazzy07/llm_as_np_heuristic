To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his goal.

The other characters will not take any actions that interfere with Tom's goal, as they are either focused on their own objectives or are not in a position to act against him.

### Explanation of the Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because it directly moves Tom to his desired location (the cottage) while carrying the medicine he has just purchased. Since there are no other actions needed to achieve Tom's goal, this is the only action required.
