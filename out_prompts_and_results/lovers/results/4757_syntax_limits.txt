In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C2) has, while Casey wants the chocolates (I2) that are in the dining room (R21). Blake (C3) is already happy because they have the flowers (I3) that they wanted. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to trade with Casey. Since Casey has the jewelry that Alex wants, and Alex can offer the flowers that Blake gave them, this trade will make Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire while also giving Casey an item (the flowers) that they can potentially use to achieve their own happiness later. This action directly fulfills Alex's goal of being happy.
