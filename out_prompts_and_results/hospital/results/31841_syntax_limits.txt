To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway needs to admit Ross to an exam room first. However, since Hathaway's workload is currently at 2, they can assess Ross without admitting him to an exam room. This will allow Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can treat Jones in PatientRoomB. Since Jones is in PatientRoomB and Hathaway's workload is still manageable, they can treat Jones effectively.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to understand what disease Ross may have, which is crucial for his treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, TreatmentA, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats Jones in PatientRoomB. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment for his condition, which will help him become healthy.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully assesses and treats the patients, ensuring they are healthy.
