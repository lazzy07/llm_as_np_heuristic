To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her acquiring the treasure and ensuring her happiness. Since Talia is currently in the Village and the treasure is in the Cave, she needs to travel to the Cave to obtain it. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels from the Village to the Cave to reach the treasure.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the Cave, which will make her wealthy.
3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia is already married to Rory, but we can reaffirm their relationship in the Cave to ensure her happiness is maintained.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Traveling to the Cave** is essential because the treasure, which will make Talia wealthy, is located there. Without this action, she cannot access the treasure.
- **Picking up the treasure** is the key action that directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy. This is crucial for her happiness as well, since wealth is a part of her desired state.
- **Marrying Rory** is not strictly necessary since they are already married, but it reinforces their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness is maintained in the context of the story.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy and happy, achieving her goals.
