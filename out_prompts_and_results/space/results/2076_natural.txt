Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve a resolution, Zoe needs to establish a friendship with the Lizard while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary to trigger the volcano's eruption. Since the surface is dangerous, Zoe is aware of the risk but is willing to take it to confront the Lizard's guardianship and the situation on the surface.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is a natural consequence of Zoe's action of walking to the surface. It creates a sense of urgency and danger, which can lead to a change in the relationship between Zoe and the Lizard.

3. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the cave.** - After the eruption, Zoe teleports back to the cave to escape the danger. This action makes the Lizard angry, but it also brings them back together in the cave, where they can confront their differences.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - In the cave, with the threat of the eruption behind them, Zoe and the Lizard realize that they both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. They decide to put aside their differences and become allies.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, which creates a dramatic backdrop for the characters to bond over their shared experiences and ultimately become friends.
