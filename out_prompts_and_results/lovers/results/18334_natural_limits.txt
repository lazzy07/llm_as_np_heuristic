In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is happy with the jewelry. 

To help Blake achieve their goal, the following action occurs:

1. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.** This action is taken because Blake has the flowers and knows that Alex wants them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake can then focus on finding the chocolates, which they want.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry.

This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness, as it allows Alex to be happy, which is part of Blake's desire to see Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
