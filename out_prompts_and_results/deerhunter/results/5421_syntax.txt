To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he will need to return to the bank to steal from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is essential as he needs to be at the bank to steal money from the clerk.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the clerk while he has the rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to execute his plan.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
