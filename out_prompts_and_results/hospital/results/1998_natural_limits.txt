3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B, which is currently unassigned. This action is necessary to manage the workload and ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. This assessment is essential for determining the appropriate treatment for Ross.

5. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy as well.
