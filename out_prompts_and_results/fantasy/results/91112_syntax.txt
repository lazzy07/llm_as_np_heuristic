To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince currently has money but no treasure. Acquiring the treasure will increase his wealth, which is one of his goals.

2. **Vince proposes to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia has already accepted Vince's previous proposal, proposing again will solidify their relationship and ensure that Vince is happy.

3. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary to complete the marriage process, which will make both Vince and Talia happy.

4. **Vince and Talia get married.**  
   - This finalizes their relationship, ensuring that Vince achieves happiness through love and companionship.

5. **Vince travels to the village with Talia.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving wealth or happiness but can be included to signify a new beginning for Vince and Talia as a married couple.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- **Action 1:** Vince picks up the treasure to increase his wealth.
- **Action 2:** Vince proposes to Talia to ensure happiness through their relationship.
- **Action 3:** Talia accepts the proposal, which is necessary for their happiness.
- **Action 4:** They get married, solidifying their happiness.
- **Action 5:** Vince travels to the village with Talia, marking a new chapter in their lives.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)",
    "propose(Vince, Talia, Cave)",
    "accept(Talia, Vince, Cave)",
    "marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)",
    "travel(Vince, Cave, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Vince achieves his goals of happiness and wealth while also maintaining a relationship with Talia.
