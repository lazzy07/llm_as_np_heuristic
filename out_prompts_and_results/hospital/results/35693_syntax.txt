2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated for the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential for Jones to become healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. This is necessary for Ross to become healthy.
