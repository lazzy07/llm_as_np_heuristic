To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Casey moves to the living room (R21)**: This is necessary because the jewelry (I3) is currently with Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22), and Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to get the jewelry.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers (I1)**: This is a strategic lie by Blake to mislead Casey. By doing this, Blake can create a situation where Casey might think they need to help Alex first, which could lead to a trade or a give action later.

3. **Casey moves to the dining room (R22)**: Now that Casey has been misled, they will move to the dining room to check on Alex and see if they can help with the flowers.

4. **Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1)**: Since Casey is in the dining room with Alex, they can give the chocolates to Alex. This action is meant to create goodwill and possibly lead to a trade.

5. **Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey**: After receiving the chocolates, Alex is now happy and willing to give Casey the jewelry, which is what Casey wants.

Now, Casey has the jewelry and is happy, achieving their goal.
