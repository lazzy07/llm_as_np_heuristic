To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are currently not fighting and have a positive relationship, Zoe can initiate a peace agreement with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures a cooperative relationship moving forward.

2. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: After making peace, Zoe can teleport back to the spaceship. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. By returning to the ship, Zoe ensures her safety.

3. **Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard can then walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps the Lizard maintain its health and safety.

4. **Lizard waits in the cave**: The Lizard can remain in the cave until the eruption is over, ensuring it stays safe from the dangers of the surface.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship.
