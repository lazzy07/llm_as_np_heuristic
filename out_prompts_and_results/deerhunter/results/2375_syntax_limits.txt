To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure the money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head back to the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded and in his possession, Bubba can now threaten the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring money.
