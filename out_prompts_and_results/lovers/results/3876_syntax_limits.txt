In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). 

Given the current situation, Blake is in the living room (R21) and knows that Alex is in the dining room (R22) and currently does not have the flowers. The only action Blake can take to help Alex is to move to the dining room and give Alex the flowers.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(Blake, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room to the dining room to be with Alex.
2. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making both Alex and Blake happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, and Blake is happy because they helped Alex achieve happiness.
