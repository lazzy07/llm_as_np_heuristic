To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. The bandit walks from the camp to the crossroads. (This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the market where the merchant is located, as the bandit needs to interact with the merchant to obtain coins.)
2. The bandit attacks the merchant. (The bandit is armed and can attack the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine and any coins the merchant may have.)
3. The bandit loots the merchant's corpse. (After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit can loot the merchant's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the merchant had.)
4. The bandit walks back to the camp. (This action is necessary for the bandit to return to the camp with the stolen items, fulfilling the goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.)

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- The bandit needs to move to the crossroads to reach the merchant.
- Attacking the merchant allows the bandit to take items without facing any consequences since the merchant is not armed.
- Looting the merchant's corpse ensures the bandit collects the medicine and any coins.
- Returning to the camp secures the stolen items in the bandit's possession.
