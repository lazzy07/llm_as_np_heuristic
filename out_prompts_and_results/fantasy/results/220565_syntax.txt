To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, she will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the treasure, Talia will travel back to the village. This is necessary because she needs to be in the village to interact with Rory and Vince.

3. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia will take the money from Vince, who is in the village. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she needs both the treasure and the money to fulfill her goal.
