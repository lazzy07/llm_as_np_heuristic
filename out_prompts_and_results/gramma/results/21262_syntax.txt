To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the TomCoin. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable after the attack on the Merchant.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Bandit Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the TomCoin and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the quickest way for the Bandit to acquire coins since Tom is currently unarmed and unable to defend himself.
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This is necessary to secure the coins in a safe location, as the Bandit prefers to be at the Bandit Camp.
- **Taking the Coin to the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has fulfilled her goal of having coins in the chest.
