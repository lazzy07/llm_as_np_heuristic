To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in the room, but I1 (the flowers) is with Casey (C3). Since Casey wants the jewelry (I2) and is currently unhappy, we can facilitate a trade between Casey and Blake.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake (C2) and Casey (C3) will trade the flowers (I1) for the jewelry (I2) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the jewelry they want, thus making them happy.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the jewelry (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I1) and will still want the jewelry (I2), but since Blake is now happy, Blake has achieved their goal.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Blake's happiness, as it directly provides them with the item they desire.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)"]
