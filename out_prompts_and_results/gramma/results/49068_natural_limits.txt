The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the medicine is now unguarded. She quickly walks to the merchant's body and loots the medicine. With the medicine in her possession, she now has a valuable item that she can either keep or sell later, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Walk to the merchant's body**: The bandit needs to reach the location of the medicine, which is now with the dead merchant.
2. **Loot the medicine**: This action allows the bandit to acquire the medicine, which is a valuable item that contributes to her goal of carrying valuable items.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal with these two actions.
