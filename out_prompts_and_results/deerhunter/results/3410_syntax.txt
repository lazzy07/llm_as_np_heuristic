To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and hungry, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba wants the money and the clerk has it. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk without any repercussions.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk's body. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a logical step after killing someone, as he is hungry.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank clerk after killing him. This action ensures that Bubba ends up with the money he desires.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money and also results in Bambi being alive, as Bambi is not directly involved in these actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: This action addresses Bubba's hunger after committing the crime, making it a logical continuation of his actions.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This final action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money.
