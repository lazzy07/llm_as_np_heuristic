Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against Bambi, who is also in the forest. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to shoot Bambi.)
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** (Bubba needs to kill Bambi to eat and satisfy his hunger, which is also a step towards achieving his goal of having money.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** (After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer, which will satisfy his hunger.)
4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain money.)
5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can steal the clerk's money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger and obtain the money he desires.
