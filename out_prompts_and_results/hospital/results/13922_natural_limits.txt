Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room A. This action reduces Hathaway's workload to 2, allowing for better focus on the next patient. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A, discovering that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.
