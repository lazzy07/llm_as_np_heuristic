To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the crossroads with a coin.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp to store the coins in the chest. This is essential for the bandit to secure her loot and achieve her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, taking the coin he is carrying. This action is crucial for the bandit to increase her coin count, which is one of her primary goals.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the bandit walks to the bandit camp. This action allows her to secure the coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins stored safely.

The bandit now has the coins she desired, either in her possession or in the chest at the camp, thus achieving her goal.
