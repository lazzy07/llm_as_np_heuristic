To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. Therefore, we can conclude the story with Bubba's actions to solidify his goal of having the money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to utilize the resources available to him.
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to return to the bank to ensure he can secure his money.
3. **Bubba decides to get money.** - Bubba wants to have money, and since he has already stolen from the clerk, he can take more money if he chooses to.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action ensures that Bubba ends up with the money he desires.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Deciding to eat Bambi**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and utilizes the resource he has just acquired (Bambi's body).
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to interact with the clerk and secure more money.
- **Deciding to get money**: This is a necessary action for Bubba to express his intent to take more money from the clerk.
- **Stealing the money from the clerk**: This final action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has eaten Bambi (who is dead) and has also stolen money from the clerk, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
