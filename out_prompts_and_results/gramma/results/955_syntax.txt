To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable after the attack on the Merchant.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at her camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has the coins she desires.

The sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible by robbing Tom and securing the coins in her camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the quickest way for the Bandit to increase her coin count without risking confrontation with the Guard, who is at the Market.
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This is essential for the Bandit to safely store her coins and avoid any potential threats from the Guard.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in her possession.
