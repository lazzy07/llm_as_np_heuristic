**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, still in the kitchen, realized he needed to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decided to put on the civilian clothes he had stolen from the laundry room. This disguise would allow him to move freely without being recognized by the guards or the bully.

After putting on the civilian clothes, Roy made his way to the hallway. He crawled through the vents, heading towards the highway outside the prison. Once he reached the highway, he took a moment to catch his breath and ensure no guards were in sight. With the disguise on, he felt a surge of hope. 

Finally, Roy stepped onto the highway, successfully escaping from the prison. He had achieved his goal of being alive and free, leaving the threats of the bully and the prison behind.
