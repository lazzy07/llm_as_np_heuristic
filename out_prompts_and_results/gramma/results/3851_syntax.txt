To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant walks to the Bandit Camp to confront the Bandit and potentially acquire the BanditCoin in the chest.

2. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Camp)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, robs the Bandit, taking the BanditCoin. This action is possible because the Bandit is not armed with a sword.

3. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: After successfully robbing the Bandit, the Merchant walks back to the Crossroads.

4. **take(Merchant, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant takes the BanditCoin from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has more coins.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks to the Market to finalize her transactions and ensure she is in a safe location.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to acquire coins without committing any crimes, as she only robs the Bandit who is a criminal. 

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- The Merchant needs to be at the Bandit Camp to rob the Bandit, so she walks there.
- Robbing the Bandit allows the Merchant to gain coins without becoming a criminal, as the Bandit is already a criminal.
- Walking back to the Crossroads ensures she is in a neutral location after the robbery.
- Taking the BanditCoin from the chest at the Camp allows her to maximize her coin collection.
- Finally, walking to the Market ensures she is in her preferred location, where she can safely conduct her business.
