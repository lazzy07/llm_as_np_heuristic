Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the incorrect treatment for Young's actual condition (Jarkis). Unfortunately, this leads to Young's demise.

After this, Hathaway returns to the admissions room to assess and treat the remaining patients, Jones and Ross. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A and Ross to Patient Room B. Then, Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers he has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Finally, Hathaway assesses Ross, who has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well. 

In the end, despite the unfortunate outcome for Young, both Jones and Ross are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
