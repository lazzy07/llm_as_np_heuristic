To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army travels from the USA to Tanis to confront the Nazis and retrieve the Ark. This is necessary because the US Army needs to be present at the location where the Ark is currently held.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: The US Army takes the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is essential as it allows the US Army to gain possession of the Ark directly from the Nazis, who are currently armed and dangerous.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, Tanis)**: The US Army opens the Ark. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army character who opened it. However, the goal is to ensure the Nazis are dead, and since they are already dead from the previous actions, this action will not affect the overall goal.

After these actions, the US Army will have the Ark, and the Nazis will be dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.

### Explanation of Actions:
