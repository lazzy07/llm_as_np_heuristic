To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the cave to the surface to confront Zoe. This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be in the same location as Zoe to interact with her and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Once the Lizard reaches the surface, it will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial as it directly addresses the Lizard's goal of making friends with other creatures, specifically Zoe.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave with the Lizard. This action signifies that Zoe is willing to engage with the Lizard and explore the cave together, fostering their new friendship.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety after spending time on the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to maintain her health and safety while still having established a friendship with the Lizard.

5. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the cave, ensuring it remains in a safe location. This action helps the Lizard maintain its safety while also allowing it to continue its role as the guardian of the planet.

By following these actions, both characters achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
