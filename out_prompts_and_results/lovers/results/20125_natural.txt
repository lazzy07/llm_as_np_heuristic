To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the dining room to the bathroom.**  
   - Blake wants the chocolates and believes they are in the dining room. However, Blake is aware that Casey is in the bathroom and can see the flowers there. Blake's move to the bathroom allows them to interact with Casey.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers.**  
   - This action is a lie, but it serves to create a distraction for Casey, who is focused on the jewelry. Blake is trying to manipulate the situation to keep Casey from thinking about the jewelry.

3. **Blake picks up the flowers in the bathroom.**  
   - By picking up the flowers, Blake is now holding an item that they can potentially trade or give away later.

4. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - Blake moves to the living room to create distance from Casey and to be closer to Alex, who has the jewelry.

5. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - Blake gives the flowers to Alex, which may make Alex happy, but it also serves to distract Alex from the jewelry.

6. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - Casey, having heard the commotion, moves to the living room to see what is happening.

7. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.**  
   - Finally, Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex, achieving their goal of being happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to manipulate the situation in a way that allows Casey to ultimately get the jewelry. Blake's actions create distractions and allow Casey to move freely to the living room where the jewelry is located.
