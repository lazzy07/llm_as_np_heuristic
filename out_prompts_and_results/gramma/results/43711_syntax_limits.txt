In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads with the Medicine stolen from the Merchant. The Bandit can achieve her goal by taking the coins from the Merchant's location.

Here’s the action that will help the Bandit achieve her goal:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit walks to the Market to take the coins from the Merchant.

This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to be at the Market to access the coins that are currently with the Merchant. 

After this action, the Bandit will be at the Market, where she can take the coins from the Merchant, thus achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible route for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.
