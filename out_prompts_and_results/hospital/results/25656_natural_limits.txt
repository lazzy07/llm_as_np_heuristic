Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to an exam room. Since Young is currently in Admissions, Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload remains manageable.

Then, Hathaway walks back to Patient Room C to treat Ross, who is experiencing Fever. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Ross becomes healthy, and Hathaway's workload decreases to 1.

Finally, Hathaway walks back to Patient Room B to treat Young. Since Young's symptoms are still unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Fever and treats Young with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment, and Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcome for Young, Hathaway successfully treated Ross, achieving the goal of having at least one patient healthy.
