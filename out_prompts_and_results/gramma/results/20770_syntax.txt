To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the coin from Tom's corpse. This action is necessary because Tom is dead, and the Bandit can take the coin he was carrying, which increases her total coins.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has the maximum amount of coins possible, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully loots Tom's coin and retrieves the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: This action allows the Bandit to take the coin from Tom, who is now dead. Since the Bandit is alive and armed, she can loot without any repercussions.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to retrieve the coins stored in the chest at her camp, further increasing her total coins.
