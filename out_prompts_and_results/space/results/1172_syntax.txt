To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to stop any potential fighting and start building a friendship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is necessary to explore the cave and potentially find a safe place away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave. This action signifies that the Lizard is also interested in maintaining the friendship and ensuring safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event emphasizes the danger of the surface but also highlights the importance of their new friendship and cooperation.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
