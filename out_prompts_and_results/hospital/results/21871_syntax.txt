To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will then assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Admissions to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment results. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment results. This is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients effectively, ensuring they all become healthy.
