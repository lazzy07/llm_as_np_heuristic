To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Rob the Bandit**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, will rob the Bandit, who is also in the Market. The Bandit is not armed with a sword, making her vulnerable. The Merchant will take one coin from the Bandit. This action helps the Merchant gain a coin without committing a crime, as the Bandit is a criminal.

2. **Buy a Coin from the Merchant**: Tom, who has just bought the medicine, will buy a coin from the Merchant using the coin he has. This action allows the Merchant to sell a coin and gain another coin, increasing her total.

3. **Walk to the Crossroads**: The Merchant will then walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Merchant to move away from the Market and avoid any potential confrontation with the Guard.

4. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: The Merchant will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action allows her to safely store her coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring they are secure.

5. **Take Coins from the Chest**: Finally, the Merchant will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action allows her to maximize her coin collection without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Bandit**: This is a strategic move to gain a coin without breaking the Merchant's moral code, as the Bandit is already a criminal.
- **Buying a Coin**: This action allows Tom to help the Merchant while also fulfilling his own goal of having the medicine.
- **Walking to the Crossroads and Bandit Camp**: These movements are necessary for the Merchant to avoid the Guard and secure her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Merchant has successfully achieved her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.
