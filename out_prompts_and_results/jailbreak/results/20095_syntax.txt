**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest is aware that Roy is in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and the gym door is locked. Ernest decides to take action to ensure both he and Roy can escape safely.

1. **go(Roy, Highway)**: Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to leave the hallway and head to the highway. This action is crucial as it allows Roy to position himself for an escape from the prison.

2. **next_day()**: The day transitions to day two. This is necessary to move the story forward and allow for new actions to be taken.

3. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Now that Roy is on the highway and disguised, he successfully escapes from the prison. This is the ultimate goal for Roy, ensuring his safety and freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **go(Roy, Highway)**: This action is essential for Roy to reach the highway where he can escape. Being in the hallway does not provide an escape route, but moving to the highway does.
  
- **next_day()**: Transitioning to day two is necessary to allow for the escape action to be valid and to signify the end of day one activities.

- **escape(Roy, Highway)**: This is the final action that fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free, as he successfully leaves the prison.
