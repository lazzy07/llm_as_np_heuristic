He decides to take a risk and goes to the kitchen to retrieve the knife, which he believes will help him defend himself and Roy against the bully.

Meanwhile, Roy is in the gym with the bully, who is currently preoccupied with his workout. Roy knows that he needs to get out of the gym to avoid being threatened further.
