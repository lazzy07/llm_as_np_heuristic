To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank, hungry, and has a loaded rifle. The bank clerk has money, and Bambi is alive in the forest. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money after shooting the clerk. Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba obtaining the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the clerk's money. By shooting the clerk, he eliminates the obstacle to obtaining the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is shot, Bubba can now safely pick up the money, achieving his goal of having money.
