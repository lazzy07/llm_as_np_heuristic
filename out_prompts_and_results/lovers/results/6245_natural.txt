To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** (This is a lie, but it misleads Casey into thinking that Alex is not interested in the jewelry, which will prompt Casey to take action.)
2. **Casey moves from the living room to the bedroom.** (Casey needs to go to the bedroom to get the jewelry.)
3. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the bedroom.** (This is the item Casey wants to achieve happiness.)
4. **Casey moves from the bedroom to the living room.** (Casey returns to the living room with the jewelry.)
5. **Casey gives the jewelry to themselves.** (This action is necessary for Casey to claim the jewelry and achieve happiness.)

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Blake's lie** is crucial as it creates a false sense of security for Casey, allowing them to act without fear of Alex wanting the jewelry.
- **Moving to the bedroom** is necessary because the jewelry is located there, and Casey needs to retrieve it.
- **Picking up the jewelry** is the action that directly leads to Casey's happiness.
- **Returning to the living room** is necessary for Casey to be back with the other characters, maintaining the social dynamic.
- **Giving the jewelry to themselves** is the final step for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
