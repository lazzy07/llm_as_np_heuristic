To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Since Young is already in Exam Room B, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: After assessing Young, Hathaway can walk to the Admissions room and assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms as well.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
