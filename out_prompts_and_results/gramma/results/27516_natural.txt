The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take action at the market where both the merchant and the guard are present. 

1. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads. (This action is necessary for the bandit to create distance from the guard and merchant, allowing her to strategize her next move.)
2. The bandit walks from the crossroads back to the market. (This action is necessary to return to the market where the merchant is, as the bandit needs to confront her to achieve her goal.)
3. The bandit attacks the merchant. (This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the merchant to take the medicine and any coins she may have.)
4. The bandit loots the merchant's corpse. (This action is necessary to take the medicine and any coins the merchant had, thus fulfilling her goal of carrying more coins.)

At the end of these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying more coins and the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the crossroads**: This creates a tactical advantage, allowing the bandit to assess the situation without immediate confrontation.
- **Walking back to the market**: This is essential for the bandit to engage with the merchant directly, as she needs to confront her to achieve her goal.
- **Attacking the merchant**: This is a direct action to eliminate the merchant, who is a potential threat and holds items the bandit wants.
- **Looting the merchant's corpse**: This final action allows the bandit to collect the items she desires, thus achieving her goal.
