**Story Completion:**

After the villain threatens the hero, the hero realizes they need to act quickly to regain control of the situation. The hero decides to confront the villain, hoping to intimidate them into relinquishing the money. However, the villain remains unfazed and instead uses their control over the President to further their own agenda.

The villain, now in control of the President, coerces the President into wanting the money for themselves, ensuring that the President will not act against the villain. The villain then gives the money to the President, solidifying their control and ensuring that the President will act in the villain's interests.
