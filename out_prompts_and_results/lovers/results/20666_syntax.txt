1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R22) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to maintain the flow of the story.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R22) to check on Casey. This action is included to show Alex's concern for Casey's happiness.
