**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Ernest knows he has a chance to confront the bully without any interruptions. He takes a deep breath, grips the knife tightly, and decides to take revenge on the bully. 

Ernest lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. In a swift motion, he uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Roy will no longer be threatened. With the bully out of the way, Ernest feels a sense of relief wash over him. 

Now that the threat is eliminated, Ernest can focus on escaping. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the hallway, making his way to the highway outside the prison. 

Once on the highway, he takes a moment to catch his breath and then escapes from the prison, finally free and alive.
