To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged, and also on acquiring the treasure. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for her to become wealthy, as the treasure will increase her wealth.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This action is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with Vince and finalize their relationship.

3. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, as marriage with Vince, who she loves, will fulfill her emotional goal.

4. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is included to show that even though Talia is achieving her goals, the characters are still experiencing normal human conditions.

5. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to show the consequences of the characters' actions and the dangers present in the cave, but it does not affect Talia's happiness or wealth since she has already married Vince.

After these actions, Talia is happy because she is married to Vince, and she is wealthy because she has the treasure.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup**: Talia needs the treasure to achieve her goal of wealth.

- **get_hungry**: This shows the ongoing life of the characters, adding depth to the story.
