**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomB to assess Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Jones is necessary to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. 

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway then walks to PatientRoomA to assess Ross. With the workload now reduced to 2 after treating Jones, Hathaway can accurately assess Ross's symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis and treats him with steroids, making Ross healthy as well.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Jones**: This action is crucial to determine Jones's condition. Even with the risk of a mistake, Hathaway needs to start the treatment process.
  
- **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: This action is necessary to ensure Jones's health. Despite the potential for error, the treatment aligns with the symptoms of Flaze, leading to a positive outcome.

- **Assess Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to check Ross's condition to ensure he receives the correct treatment.

- **Treat Ross with Steroids**: This final action is essential to ensure Ross's health, as it directly addresses the symptoms of Jarkis.

By completing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
