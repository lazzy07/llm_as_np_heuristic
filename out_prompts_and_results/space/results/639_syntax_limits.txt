Zoe, aboard her spaceship, realizes that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano. She decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to assist the Lizard, as she believes he is in danger and wants to make friends.

Once on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and sees that he is struggling to find safety from the volcano. Instead of fighting, she approaches him with a friendly demeanor.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which allows them to establish a friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a natural consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. This action results in the Lizard being killed, as he is unable to escape the eruption in time.

In the end, Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, but the eruption leads to the Lizard's demise. This story illustrates the themes of friendship and the unpredictability of nature.
