**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats him with steroids if he shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash). This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's condition and determine the appropriate treatment. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot know which disease Ross has.
  
- **Treat Ross**: This action is critical to ensure Ross's health. If he has Flaze, antibiotics will cure him. If not treated correctly, he could die.

- **Assess Young**: Similar to Ross, assessing Young is necessary to identify his condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

- **Treat Young**: This action is essential to ensure Young's health. If he has Jarkis, steroids will cure him. Proper treatment is vital for his survival.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, achieving the goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
