To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Given the current situation, Alex is in the dining room (R21) and has the chocolates (I2). Casey is in the living room (R22) and has the flowers (I1). 

The simplest action for Alex to take is to trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This will make Alex happy, as they will have the item they want.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the chocolates they have for the flowers that Casey has. This action is necessary because it directly allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will still want the jewelry (I3), but that does not affect Alex's goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
