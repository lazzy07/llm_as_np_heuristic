Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that there are three patients (Jones, Ross, and Young) and Hathaway's current workload is 2, she can safely assess and treat two patients without making a mistake. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to assign Young to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat him later.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is currently in Patient Room C.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.**  
   - Hathaway needs to assess Ross next, who is in Patient Room A.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids, which will make him healthy.

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.**  
   - Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is now in Patient Room B.

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B.**  
    - Assuming Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.

By following this sequence, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats all three patients, ensuring they are all healthy.
