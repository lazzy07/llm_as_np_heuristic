2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After establishing peace, Zoe suggests they explore the cave together, which is a safe location away from the dangers of the surface. This action helps to solidify their newfound friendship and allows them to bond over their shared exploration.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard continue to communicate and share stories, further deepening their friendship. This action reinforces their relationship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in each other's company.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy.
