To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any room, but we know that I1 (the flowers) is with Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room to the dining room, where Alex and Casey are currently located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.
   
2. **tell(C3, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to mislead Alex into thinking that Casey wants the flowers, while in reality, Casey wants the jewelry (I2). This will help Alex to focus on the wrong item.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room to find the flowers (I1) that Casey mentioned. This is necessary for Alex to pick up the item that they believe Casey wants.

4. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the living room. This is necessary for Alex to have an item to give to Casey.

5. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex returns to the dining room with the flowers (I1) to give them to Casey.

6. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is necessary for Casey to feel happy, as they now have the flowers.

7. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room to retrieve the jewelry (I2) that is in the living room.

8. **pick_up(C3, I2, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the living room. This is necessary for Casey to achieve their happiness.

9. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey returns to the dining room with the jewelry (I2).

10. **give(C3, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This is the final action that ensures Blake is happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry (I2), achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the transfer of items between characters while ensuring that the characters believe they are working towards their own happiness.
- The misleading information about the flowers helps to divert attention from the actual item that Casey wants, allowing for a successful exchange.
