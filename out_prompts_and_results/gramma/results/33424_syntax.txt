To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, which is necessary for the bandit to accumulate more coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This is necessary for the bandit to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has coins in her possession, achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial because it allows the bandit to gain a coin without any risk of retaliation, as Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move to a location where the bandit can secure her gains and potentially store more coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
