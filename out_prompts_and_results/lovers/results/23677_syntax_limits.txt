In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are currently unhappy. Casey (C3) is happy because they have the item they want (the chocolates, I3). Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the flowers (I2), which are currently in the bathroom (R21).

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Blake to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action will make Alex happy, as they will receive the item they desire.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex in the dining room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake will be unhappy because they still want the flowers.
- Casey will remain happy with the chocolates.

This action is necessary and sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
