The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is carrying a sword, the bandit decides to take a risk. She approaches the hero and, with a swift motion, attacks him. The hero, caught off guard, is unable to defend himself and is killed. The bandit then loots the hero's coin, adding it to her own collection.

Now, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Attack the hero**: The bandit attacks the hero because she knows he is not armed and can be easily defeated. This action is necessary for her to eliminate a potential threat and gain more coins.
2. **Loot the hero's coin**: After defeating the hero, the bandit loots his coin, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
