Ernest, feeling the tension in the gym with the bully looming over him and Roy, decides to take a bold action. He knows he has the knife and the element of surprise on his side. With a swift motion, he lunges at the bully, using the knife to defend himself and Roy. The bully, caught off guard, is unable to retaliate in time, and Ernest successfully kills him.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened. They can now focus on their escape. Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then leads Roy through the hallway and out to the highway, where they can finally escape from the prison.
