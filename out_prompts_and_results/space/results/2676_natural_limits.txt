Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard. She believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface, but she hopes to change that perception by showing her willingness to assist. 

Upon teleporting to the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard struggling to escape the danger of the erupting volcano. Instead of fighting, Zoe approaches the Lizard and offers her help. The Lizard, surprised by Zoe's gesture, begins to see her as a potential friend rather than an enemy. They work together to find a safe path away from the volcano, and in the process, they bond over their shared goal of survival.

However, as they escape, the volcano erupts violently, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise. Despite this tragic outcome, Zoe's actions of helping the Lizard and their brief moment of friendship before the eruption solidify her understanding of the importance of connection, even in dire circumstances.
