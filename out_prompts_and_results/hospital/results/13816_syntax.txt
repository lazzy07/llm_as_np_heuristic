To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Since Ross is already assigned to PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Young is currently in Admissions and needs to be assessed to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also recovers.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the correct treatment.
2. **Assess(Young)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the correct treatment.
3. **Treat(Ross)**: This action is necessary to provide the correct treatment to Ross based on his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.
4. **Treat(Young)**: This action is necessary to provide the correct treatment to Young based on his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_symptom, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

Note: The specific treatments for Ross and Young will depend on the symptoms assessed, which are not defined in the current context. However, the actions taken will ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all patients healthy.
