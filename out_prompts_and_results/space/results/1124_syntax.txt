To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface. This action is important because it places Zoe in the same location as the Lizard, allowing for potential interaction and the possibility of making peace.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Since they are not fighting, they can establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the death of any characters on the surface. Since Zoe has just made peace with the Lizard, this action will result in the Lizard dying, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

The final sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard having made peace before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption, creating a dangerous situation.
- **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Moves Zoe to the surface to interact with the Lizard.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in the Lizard's death.
