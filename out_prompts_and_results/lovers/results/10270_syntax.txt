To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain social connections.

4. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they have the flowers. This action is to communicate their happiness and share the joy of having the item they wanted.

5. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that they have the flowers. Similar to the previous action, this is to share their happiness with Blake.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted. Casey and Blake are still unhappy, but the goal of Alex being happy has been achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)",
    "tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)"

}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
