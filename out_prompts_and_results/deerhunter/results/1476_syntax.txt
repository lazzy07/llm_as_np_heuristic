To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba has just eaten Bambi and is in the forest. He is aware that the bank clerk is at the bank with some money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Go from Forest to Bank**: Bubba needs to move to the bank where the clerk is located to obtain the money.
2. **Steal from Clerk**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is. Without going to the bank, he cannot interact with the clerk or obtain the money.
  
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money, achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully obtains the money he desires while following the rules and actions available in the story.
