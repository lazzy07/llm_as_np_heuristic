To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room. This is essential as Alex needs to have the item they desire to be happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is important for Alex to share their happiness with others.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn contributes to Alex's own happiness.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be with Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to create a sense of community and connection among the characters.

6. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action helps to ensure that Blake is happy, which is important for Casey's happiness.

7. **give(C3, I3, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex is now happy because they have received the item they wanted.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, and Casey is also happy because they received the flowers from Alex. Blake is happy because they received the chocolates from Casey.
