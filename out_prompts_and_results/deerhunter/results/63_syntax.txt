To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, which means he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he also has the option to go back to the bank to potentially steal money from the bank clerk, who is currently at the bank.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and focus on his next goal, which is to get money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the bank clerk using the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and plan his next move.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the bank clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the bank clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
