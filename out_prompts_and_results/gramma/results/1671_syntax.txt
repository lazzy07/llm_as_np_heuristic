To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Bandit.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, who is armed, robs Tom of his coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to acquire coins, but it also indirectly benefits the Merchant by creating a situation where the Bandit has more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks back to the Camp with the stolen coin, which allows her to store her coins in the chest.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market to continue her business and potentially sell items.

5. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: The Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using the coin she has. This action allows the Merchant to acquire an item of value while also ensuring she does not become a criminal.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully acquired the medicine and has not engaged in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's initial movement to the Crossroads allows her to interact with both Tom and the Bandit.
- The Bandit robbing Tom is a necessary action to increase the Bandit's coin count, which indirectly benefits the Merchant by creating a more dynamic environment.
- The Bandit returning to the Camp ensures that she can store her coins safely, which is part of her goal.
- The Merchant's return to the Market is essential for her to continue her trade and maximize her coin collection.
- Finally, the Merchant buying the medicine from Tom allows her to achieve her goal without resorting to criminal behavior.
