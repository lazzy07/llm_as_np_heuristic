To complete the story, Tom needs to get to the cottage while carrying the medicine. Since the medicine is currently at the merchant's location, and the merchant is dead, Tom can loot the medicine from the merchant's corpse. After acquiring the medicine, Tom can then walk back to the cottage.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: Tom loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying it.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the market to the cottage. This action is necessary to reach his desired location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Looting the medicine** is essential because it allows Tom to fulfill his goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage.
- **Walking to the cottage** is the final step that takes Tom to his desired location.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "loot(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine.
