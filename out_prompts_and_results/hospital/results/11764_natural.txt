**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis, the disease associated with that symptom. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, Hathaway first assesses Ross, who is still in the admissions room, to determine his symptoms.

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.** (This action is necessary to understand Ross's condition and ensure that Hathaway's workload does not lead to a mistake when treating Jones.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A for Jarkis.** (Since Jones has a rash, this treatment is appropriate, and it will help him become healthy.)

After treating Jones correctly, Hathaway's workload decreases, allowing him to focus on Young next.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for further assessment.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis if he has a rash or Flaze if he has a fever.** (This action is necessary to ensure Young also becomes healthy.)

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Ross helps to clarify his condition and reduces the risk of misdiagnosis due to Hathaway's high workload.
- Treating Jones for Jarkis is the correct action based on his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.
- Admitting Young to Patient Room B prepares him for assessment and treatment.
- Assessing Young allows Hathaway to identify his symptoms and provide the correct treatment.
- Treating Young ensures that he also becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
