To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, so Bambi is dead. However, we also need to ensure that Bubba can secure the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the rifle back from the clerk, ensuring he has a weapon for intimidation.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba will decide to take the money from the clerk.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Money, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the bank where the money is located.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action ensures Bubba has a weapon to intimidate the clerk, reinforcing his control over the situation.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to focus on his goal of acquiring money.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Money, Bank)**: This final action allows Bubba to successfully take the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of having the money.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is already dead.
