To achieve Bubba's goal of having 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** (Bubba already wants to have money, so this action is reaffirming his goal.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, and since the clerk has 0 money, shooting the clerk will allow Bubba to take the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

This sequence of actions is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money while ensuring that he uses the rifle he has to eliminate the clerk as a threat and take the money.

Hereâ€™s the complete story:

Bubba, having already picked up the rifle and loaded it with ammunition, decides to get money. He goes to the bank where the clerk is present. In a moment of desperation and hunger, Bubba shoots the clerk, eliminating any threat. Afterward, he steals the money from the clerk, successfully achieving his goal of having 1 money.
