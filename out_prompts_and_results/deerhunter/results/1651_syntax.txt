To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the rifle and has already stolen it from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed level of 1, indicating he wants money. The clerk is also greedy but is not hungry. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is a potential obstacle to Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is included because Bubba is hungry, and eating the clerk will satisfy his hunger while also ensuring that he has no witnesses to his crime.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the clerk. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger and removes evidence of his crime.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
