To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has the money but is not hungry. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - Bubba is hungry and wants to eat. Since Bambi is alive and in the same location, Bubba can shoot Bambi to potentially eat her. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's hunger and to eliminate Bambi.
  
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action directly results in Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions we need to fulfill. 

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, satisfying his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to feel fulfilled and to have a reason to be in the forest.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can now take the money that Bambi had, which fulfills his goal of having money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi:** This action is necessary to eliminate Bambi and fulfill Bubba's hunger.
- **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi:** This action ensures that Bambi is dead, which is one of the required outcomes.
- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger after killing Bambi.
- **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money and Bambi is dead.
