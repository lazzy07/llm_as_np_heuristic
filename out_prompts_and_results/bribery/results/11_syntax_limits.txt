In the bank, the Hero, having just stolen the money, is now in a position of power over the Villain, who had previously threatened them. The Hero knows that the Villain intends to control the President using the money, which poses a significant threat. To prevent this, the Hero decides to take decisive action.

1. **Bribe the Villain**: The Hero uses the stolen money to bribe the Villain, ensuring that the Villain will no longer pursue their plan to control the President. This action is crucial because it neutralizes the Villain's threat and secures the Hero's control over the situation.

2. **Coerce the Villain**: The Hero then coerces the Villain into wanting the President to have the money. This action ensures that the Villain, now under the Hero's influence, will not only abandon their plans but will also support the idea of giving the money to the President, further solidifying the Hero's control over the situation.

With these actions, the Hero successfully prevents the Villain from controlling the President and achieves their goal of ensuring the safety of the President and the integrity of the bank.
