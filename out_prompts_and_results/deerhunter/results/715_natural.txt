To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has the money but is not in the forest. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but provides closure by returning Bubba to the forest.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Deciding to steal**: This action is a logical step for Bubba since he wants money and has the means (the rifle) to intimidate the clerk.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the action that directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Returning to the forest**: While not necessary for the goal, it completes the narrative by bringing Bubba back to his original location.
