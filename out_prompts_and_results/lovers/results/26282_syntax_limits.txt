In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Given the current situation, Blake can take the following action:

1. **trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R22)**: Blake can trade the jewelry (I1) they picked up from Casey with the flowers (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) they wanted, making them happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I3), which they do not want but are happy because they helped Alex achieve their goal.

Now, hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This single action effectively fulfills Blake's goal of making Alex happy, thus achieving Blake's own happiness as well.
