To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross** in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat Ross** in Exam Room C with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
3. **Assess Young** in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat Young** in Exam Room A with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
5. **Assess Jones** in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones** in the Admissions room with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.
2. **Treat Ross**: Once Ross's symptoms are assessed, treating him with the correct medication will ensure he becomes healthy.
3. **Assess Young**: Similar to Ross, assessing Young's symptoms is crucial for determining the correct treatment.
4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, treating him with the correct medication will ensure he becomes healthy.
5. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in the admissions room, assessing his symptoms is necessary to determine his condition.
6. **Treat Jones**: Finally, treating Jones with the correct medication based on his symptoms will ensure he becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
