In the living room, Alex sees Casey holding the chocolates and realizes that Casey is not aware of the flowers in the dining room. Alex decides to take action to help both themselves and Casey. 

**Action:**
1. Alex tells Casey that the flowers are wanted.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it informs Casey about the flowers, which are in the dining room. By doing this, Alex is indirectly guiding Casey to the flowers, which will ultimately help Alex achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they know where the flowers are and can go get them.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is now aware of the flowers and can go to the dining room to pick them up.
