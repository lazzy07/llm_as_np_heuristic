To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit walks from the camp to the crossroads. 
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the hero and the merchant, allowing for potential robbery or interaction.

2. The bandit robs the hero of the medicine.
   - The bandit needs to take the medicine from the hero to ensure that they have an item of value, which can be used for trade or leverage.

3. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the camp.
   - This action allows the bandit to return to their base with the stolen medicine, ensuring safety and the ability to store the item.

4. The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.
   - By placing the medicine in the chest, the bandit secures the item and can now focus on accumulating coins.

5. The bandit walks back to the crossroads.
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to potentially interact with the guard or the market for further opportunities to acquire coins.

6. The bandit walks to the market.
   - This action allows the bandit to engage with the merchant or other characters who may have coins.

7. The bandit robs the merchant of any coins they may have.
   - This is a direct action to achieve the goal of carrying more coins.

8. The bandit walks back to the camp with the coins.
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully secured the coins and can store them safely in the chest.

By following these actions, the bandit successfully achieves their goal of carrying coins and having valuable items secured at the camp.
