In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Hathaway (Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine what symptoms he is showing. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway (Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will also make him healthy.

By taking these actions, we ensure that Jones receives the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, allowing him to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
