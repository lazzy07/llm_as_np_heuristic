To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation without being harmed by the bandit or the guard. Hereâ€™s the shortest story:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. This action is necessary for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage.

The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) are not involved in any actions that would affect Tom's goal directly at this point. The Merchant is at the Crossroads but does not take any action that would interfere with Tom. The Guard is at the Market, and the Bandit is also at the Market, so they do not pose a threat to Tom as he moves to the Cottage.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it directly moves Tom to his desired location, the Cottage, where he can carry the medicine. Since there are no threats present at the Cottage, this action allows Tom to successfully achieve his goal without any conflict.
