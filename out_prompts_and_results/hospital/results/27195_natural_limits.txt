Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room C first. Since Young is already assigned to this room, Hathaway can assess their symptoms without increasing their workload. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the Admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Since Jones is still in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway can assign them to an exam room without increasing their workload. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B and finds that Jones is experiencing a fever, indicating that Jones has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Jones healthy as well.

With both Young and Jones treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
