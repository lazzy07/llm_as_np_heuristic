In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (flowers), Blake (C2) wants the item I2 (chocolates), and Casey (C3) is already happy with the item I3 (jewelry). Since Alex is not happy, Blake can help Alex by giving them the item they want.

**Action:**
1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)** - Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R12).

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy. Since Blake's goal is to ensure Alex is happy, this action fulfills that requirement.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the jewelry (I3).

Blake's goal of making Alex happy is achieved with this single action.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C2, I1, C1, R12)"]
}
```
