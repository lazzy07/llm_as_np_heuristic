To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will leave the Market and head towards the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move away from the scene of the conflict and to a location where they can access the Bandit Camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to reach their preferred location where they can store the coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions are necessary for the Bandit to leave the Market, where they are currently located, and to reach the Bandit Camp, which is their preferred location. 
- The last action is crucial as it directly achieves the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
