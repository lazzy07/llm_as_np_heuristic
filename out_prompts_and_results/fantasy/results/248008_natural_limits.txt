In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to ensure that she has both happiness and wealth. Since she is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness is guaranteed through their relationships. However, she needs to increase her wealth.

Here's the completion of the story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** (This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince has, which is 1 unit of money. This action also eliminates Vince, who does not care about being rich, thus simplifying the situation for Talia.)

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body.** (After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This increases Gargax's wealth but also allows Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy since she can now negotiate with Gargax.)

3. **Talia proposes to Gargax.** (Talia proposes to Gargax to secure a deal for the money. This action is strategic as it allows Talia to gain wealth through Gargax.)

4. **Gargax accepts Talia's proposal.** (Gargax accepts the proposal, which makes Talia happy as she is now in a position to negotiate for the money.)

5. **Talia and Gargax get married.** (This marriage solidifies Talia's happiness and allows her to claim the wealth she desires.)

At the end of these actions, Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy.
