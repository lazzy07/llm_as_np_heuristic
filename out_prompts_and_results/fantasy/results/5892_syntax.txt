To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. Since Talia's happiness is tied to her relationship with Vince, we can conclude the story with their marriage. Additionally, we can have Vince give Talia the money he possesses, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave where Rory and Gargax are located. This is necessary for him to interact with Talia and to give her the money.
   
2. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Village)**: Vince takes the money he has and brings it with him to the cave. This is necessary for Talia to become wealthy.

3. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to meet Vince. This is necessary for the marriage to take place.

4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Vince and Talia get married. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her goal.

5. **give(Vince, Talia, Money)**: Vince gives Talia the money he has. This action will make Talia wealthy, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince needs to be in the cave to interact with Talia.
- **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Village)**: Vince must have the money to give to Talia.
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia needs to be present in the cave for the marriage.
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This action makes Talia happy as she is now married to Vince.
- **give(Vince, Talia, Money)**: This action makes Talia wealthy, as she now possesses the money.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json

    "travel(Talia, Village, Cave)",
    "marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)",
    "give(Vince, Talia, Money)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia becomes both happy and wealthy by the end of the story.
