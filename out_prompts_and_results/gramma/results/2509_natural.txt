To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit needs to be at the market to potentially interact with the hero and the guard.

2. **The bandit robs the hero.**  
   - The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the hero who is unarmed. The bandit takes the hero's coin, which helps the bandit achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After robbing the hero, the bandit returns to the crossroads to avoid being caught by the guard.

4. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant.**  
   - The guard, who is at the market, reports the bandit's location to the merchant, which is necessary for the merchant to be aware of the bandit's activities.

5. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant moves to the crossroads to confront the bandit and potentially negotiate or take action regarding the stolen coin.

6. **The merchant buys the medicine from the merchant.**  
   - The merchant uses her coins to buy the medicine back from herself, ensuring she has the medicine and can sell it again for profit.

7. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant returns to the market to continue her business and sell the medicine, thus maximizing her coins.

By following these actions, the merchant successfully acquires coins and the medicine without engaging in criminal activity.
