Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze, which is incorrect. However, she treats him with antibiotics, which is the wrong treatment for Ross. Ross dies as a result of the incorrect treatment.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing and treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to an exam room. This action is necessary to ensure that Young receives the attention he needs.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B, which is already assigned to him. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is in the correct room for assessment and treatment.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has assessed and treated Ross, and admitted Young, which allows her to focus on the remaining patients. Although Ross did not survive, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at ensuring the health of the remaining patients.

**Final Explanation**: 
- The first action was to assess Ross, which was necessary to determine his condition, even though it led to a mistake. 
- The second action was to walk to Admissions and admit Young, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and can receive care.
