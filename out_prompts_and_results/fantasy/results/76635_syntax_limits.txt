In this story, Gargax the dragon is already in the Village and has taken the money from Rory. To achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, Gargax needs to acquire the treasure located in the Cave. Since Gargax is not hungry at the moment, he can simply travel to the Cave to pick up the treasure.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)** - Gargax travels from the Village to the Cave to acquire the treasure.

This action is necessary because Gargax needs to reach the location where the treasure is in order to fulfill his goal of becoming wealthy.

After this action, Gargax will have both the money and the treasure, achieving his goal of wealth.
