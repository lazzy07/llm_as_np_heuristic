**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realized he had to act quickly. He had the knife in his possession, and the bully was unaware of his intentions. 

Roy decided to use the knife to kill the bully. With a swift motion, he lunged at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, who had been threatening both Roy and Ernest, was no longer a danger. 

With the bully dead, Roy felt a surge of relief. He quickly took off the civilian clothes he had stolen and put them on, disguising himself. He then unlocked the gym door and made his way to the hallway.
