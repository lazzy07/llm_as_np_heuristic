To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged, and she has the treasure. The goal is to get married to Vince, which will make them both happy, and Talia will also retain her treasure, thus achieving her wealth goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where Rory and Gargax are located. This is necessary for her to interact with Rory and finalize her relationship with Vince.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the village to be with Talia and Vince. This is necessary for the next action where Talia and Vince can get married.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action fulfills Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, as marriage will make them both happy, and Talia retains her treasure.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Traveling to the Cave**: Talia needs to be in the same location as Rory and Gargax to finalize her relationship with Vince and ensure that they can get married.
- **Rory traveling to the Village**: This action is necessary to ensure that Talia and Vince can marry without any interruptions or complications from Rory or Gargax.
- **Marrying Talia and Vince**: This is the final action that ensures Talia achieves her goal of happiness and wealth through marriage.
