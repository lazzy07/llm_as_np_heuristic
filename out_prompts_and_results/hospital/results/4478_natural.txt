**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis (the rash) instead of Flaze (the fever). 

2. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies. 

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting there.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, where Young is currently assigned.

5. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

7. **Walk back to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross.

8. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is still experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

9. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions lead to the unfortunate demise of all patients, but she has completed her assessments and treatments, albeit with mistakes due to her high workload. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
