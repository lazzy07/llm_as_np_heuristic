Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows him to assess Ross's condition. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, he decides to treat Ross with steroids, assuming he might have Jarkis. This is a risky move, but Hathaway is determined to help all patients.

After treating Ross, Hathaway returns to Admissions to check on Young. He admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing his workload to 3. He then assesses Young, who also has unknown symptoms. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, assuming he might have Flaze.

In the end, Jones is treated correctly for his fever, Ross is treated incorrectly but survives, and Young is treated correctly for his unknown symptoms. All patients are alive, and Hathaway has done his best to ensure their health.
