In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard, while the Lizard also desires friendship and safety.

To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, a character dies, and the two characters become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe walks from the Surface to the Cave.** This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact and potentially make peace. 
   
2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard in the Cave.** This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship. 

3. **The volcano erupts on the Surface.** This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is currently on the surface when the eruption occurs.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and she and the Lizard become friends before the eruption.
