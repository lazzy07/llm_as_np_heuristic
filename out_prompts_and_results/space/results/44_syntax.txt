To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will reflect the characters' goals of safety and friendship, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends. 
   - Action: `walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)`

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: By initiating a peaceful interaction, Zoe can establish a friendship with the Lizard, which is one of her goals. 
   - Action: `make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)`

3. **The volcano erupts**: After the characters have made peace, the volcano erupts, fulfilling the requirement for a character to die. Since both characters are on the surface, they are in danger. 
   - Action: `erupt(Surface)`

4. **Zoe dies**: As a result of the eruption, Zoe is killed, which satisfies the condition of a character dying. 
   - Action: `kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)`

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purposes:

- **Walking to the cave** allows Zoe to interact with the Lizard, which is essential for building a friendship.
- **Making peace** establishes a positive relationship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship.
- **Erupting the volcano** introduces the danger that leads to Zoe's demise, which is a critical plot point.
- **Killing Zoe** as a result of the eruption concludes the story with a character's death.
