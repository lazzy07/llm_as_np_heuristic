Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's safety. Since they are friends, she wants to help the Lizard as well. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action is taken to find a safer location for both Zoe and the Lizard, as the surface is dangerous.
2. **Zoe invites the Lizard to join her in the cave**: This action is implied as part of their friendship, ensuring that they both stay safe together.
3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave**: This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they are both healthy and safe in a secure location away from the dangers of the surface.

By moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe, while also ensuring the Lizard is safe and they can continue to be friends.
