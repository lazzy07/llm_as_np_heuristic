To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi, which is essential for achieving his greedy goal of obtaining money or killing Bambi.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action fulfills the requirement of either having Bubba obtain money or Bambi being dead. Since Bambi is a deer and Bubba is hungry, this action also aligns with Bubba's desire to eat.

After these two actions, Bubba has successfully killed Bambi, which satisfies the condition of Bambi being dead. 

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- **Loading the rifle** is crucial for Bubba to have the means to kill Bambi or intimidate the bank clerk. Without a loaded gun, he cannot take any aggressive action.
- **Shooting Bambi** directly fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, which is one of the two possible endings we are aiming for.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)"
  ]
}
