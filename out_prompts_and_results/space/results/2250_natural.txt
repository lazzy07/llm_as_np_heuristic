Zoe and the Lizard are currently at the cave, having made peace and become friends. However, the surface is still dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have the following sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because it places Zoe in the dangerous location where the volcano can erupt, setting up the potential for a character to die.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is triggered by the narrative's conditions, leading to the next action.

3. **Zoe dies.** - As a result of the eruption, Zoe is killed, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard, being a guardian, may feel compelled to check on the situation after the eruption, but since Zoe is already dead, this action does not change the outcome.

5. **The Lizard mourns Zoe.** - This action is implied as the Lizard reflects on the loss of its new friend, solidifying their bond even in death.

The story concludes with Zoe's death due to the eruption, while the Lizard remains safe, having not been on the surface during the eruption. The friendship between Zoe and the Lizard is established through their previous actions, even though Zoe is no longer alive.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.",
    "The volcano erupts.",
    "Zoe dies.",
    "The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that the story meets the specified ending conditions while maintaining the integrity of the characters' goals and relationships.
