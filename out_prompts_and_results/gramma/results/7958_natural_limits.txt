Tom, realizing he is unarmed and in a dangerous situation at the market, decides to take a strategic action. He quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, knowing that the guard is armed and can deal with the bandit. 

The guard, upon receiving the information, immediately confronts the bandit. With the guard's sword drawn, he attacks the bandit, who is unable to defend herself since she is armed but cannot fight back against another armed character. The guard successfully kills the bandit.

With the bandit defeated, Tom is now safe. He picks up the bandit's sword and the coins she had stolen from him. Finally, he walks back to the cottage, carrying the medicine he looted from the merchant earlier, thus achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
