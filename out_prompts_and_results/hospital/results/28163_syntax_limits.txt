In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in a situation where they need to treat patients effectively to ensure their health. The goal is to treat all patients correctly based on their symptoms and ensure they recover.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomC to confirm his symptoms. Since Ross has already been assessed with SymptomB, Hathaway knows he has Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Hathaway is aware of Ross's condition before treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones and Young. This action is necessary to check on the remaining patients and ensure they receive the appropriate treatment.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions to determine his symptoms. This is essential to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Young**: If Young is found to have Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
