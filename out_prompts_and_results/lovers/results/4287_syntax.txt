To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). Currently, Blake is in the dining room (R21) and the chocolates are also in the dining room. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and potentially trade or receive the chocolates.
   
2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Blake is now happy because they have the chocolates.
- Alex and Casey are still happy with their items.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: This action allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, who has the chocolates. It is necessary for interaction.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: This action is essential as it directly gives Blake the item they want, thus achieving Blake's goal of happiness.
