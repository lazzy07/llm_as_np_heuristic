3. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - Zoe teleports to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the eruption. This action is necessary for her survival, but it makes the Lizard angry because it leaves the Lizard alone on the surface.

4. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard, feeling abandoned and angry, walks back to the cave. This action is important as it shows the Lizard's emotional response to Zoe's teleportation.

5. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - Realizing the Lizard is upset, Zoe teleports back to the cave to apologize and make amends. This action is necessary to restore their friendship.

6. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - Zoe expresses her regret for leaving the Lizard alone and reassures the Lizard of her commitment to their friendship. This action is crucial to solidifying their bond.

7. **The volcano erupts again.** - The volcano erupts once more, creating a sense of urgency. This event reinforces the danger of the surface and the need for both characters to work together.

8. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to work together to protect the planet.** - They agree to collaborate on finding a solution to the volcanic threat, which strengthens their friendship further.
