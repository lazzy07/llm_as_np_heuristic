**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure a pack of cigarettes. He knows that Roy has stolen the bully's cigarettes, which puts both of them at risk. To protect himself and Roy, Ernest quickly moves to the hallway.

In the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening them further and gives them a chance to escape. 

With the gym locked, Ernest then crawls through the vents to the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. This disguise allows him to blend in and avoid detection.

Finally, Ernest escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free from threats.
