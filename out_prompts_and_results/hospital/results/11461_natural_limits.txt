Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.)
2. **Ross walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Ross to be in the room where he can be assessed by Dr. Hathaway.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** (Assuming Ross has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** (Since Jones is in Patient Room C and has a fever, this action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy as well.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
