1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to access the treasure located in the cave, which will help him become wealthy.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - By picking up the treasure, Vince increases his wealth, which is essential for Rory's goal since Rory needs to be wealthy.

3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village to share his newfound wealth with Rory and Talia.

4. **Vince gives the treasure to Rory.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of his goals.

5. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure from Vince, Rory achieves happiness, fulfilling another of his goals.

6. **Rory does not become hungry.**  
   - Since Rory is not hungry at the start and has received the treasure, he can maintain his state of not being hungry.
