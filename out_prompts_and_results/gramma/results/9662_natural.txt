To ensure the guard achieves their goal of killing criminals, the story will unfold as follows:

1. The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard. (The guard believes the bandit is at the crossroads, and since the bandit is a criminal, this action aligns with the guard's goal of killing criminals.)
2. The guard walks to the bandit camp. (The guard needs to confront the bandit directly to fulfill their goal.)
3. The guard attacks the bandit. (This action is necessary for the guard to kill the bandit, who is a criminal.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Report the location of the bandit to the guard**: This action is crucial as it allows the guard to identify the bandit's whereabouts, which is essential for the next steps in achieving the guard's goal.
- **Walk to the bandit camp**: The guard must physically go to the bandit camp to confront the bandit. This is a necessary action to ensure the guard can engage in combat with the bandit.
- **Attack the bandit**: This is the final action that directly leads to the guard achieving their goal of killing a criminal.
