To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage or wealth through acquiring treasure. Since Rory has already proposed to Talia, the next logical step is for Talia to accept the proposal, which will make both of them happy. After that, we can have Talia and Rory pick up the treasure, which will also contribute to Talia's wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action contributes to Talia's wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy and wealthy, achieving her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her primary goals.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, which is another of her goals.
