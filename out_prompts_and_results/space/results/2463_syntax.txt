To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe is currently in the cave and needs to be on the surface to witness the eruption and interact with the Lizard. This action allows her to move to the surface where the volcano is located.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, the volcano can begin to erupt. This action sets the stage for the eruption to occur.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which will lead to the death of the Lizard, who is currently on the surface and in danger.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Before the eruption, Zoe can attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

The final sequence of actions ensures that the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe to establish a friendship with the Lizard before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Necessary for Zoe to be in the right location to interact with the Lizard and witness the eruption.
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Initiates the eruption process, which is crucial for the story's climax.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the Lizard's demise.
