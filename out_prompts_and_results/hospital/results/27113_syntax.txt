To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A and Ross is assigned there, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can walk to Exam Room B to assess Young. This is important to determine Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This is also necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is currently there. This is the last step to ensure all patients are treated.

6. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.
