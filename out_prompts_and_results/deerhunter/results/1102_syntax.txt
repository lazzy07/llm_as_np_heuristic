To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed for money. The clerk is also greedy but is not in a position to defend himself since Bubba has the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and the clerk is the only one who can provide it.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and Bambi remains alive, which is acceptable as the goal is met with Bubba having the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential threat and holds the money that Bubba desires. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk without any repercussions.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money from the bank, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.
