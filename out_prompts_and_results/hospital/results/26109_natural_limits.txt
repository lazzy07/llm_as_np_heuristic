Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, assesses Jones, who is in Admissions. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway knows that Jones is alive and wants to ensure all patients are healthy. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Jones directly, as Jones is currently in Admissions and not in an exam room.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Hathaway can now assess and treat Jones for any potential disease. This also reduces the workload by one.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - After admitting Jones, Hathaway can now assess Jones's symptoms. If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash), Hathaway can treat accordingly. Assuming Jones has Flaze, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial as it directly leads to Jones becoming healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring that all patients are healthy.
