Bubba is determined to get money, and he knows that the bank clerk has the money he desires. To achieve his goal, he needs to take decisive actions.

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** - Bubba leaves the bank to go to the forest where Bambi is located. He needs to find Bambi to potentially use her as a means to satisfy his hunger, which is a priority before he can confront the clerk again.

2. **Bubba picks up Bambi.** - Bubba finds Bambi in the forest. He decides to capture her, as he is hungry and needs to eat.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.** - Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger. This action is crucial because it allows him to regain strength and focus on his goal of obtaining money.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank, now feeling stronger and more determined.

5. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - With the rifle loaded, Bubba confronts the bank clerk and shoots him, eliminating the threat and ensuring he can take the money without resistance.

6. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - Finally, Bubba takes the money from the now-unconscious clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger. Each action is strategically chosen to ensure Bubba can successfully confront the clerk and take the money without any obstacles.
