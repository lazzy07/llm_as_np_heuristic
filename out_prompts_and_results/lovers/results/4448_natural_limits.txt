In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present, but none of them are happy. Alex wants the flowers, which are with Casey, while Blake wants the chocolates that Alex is holding, and Casey wants the jewelry that Blake has. 

To achieve happiness, Alex decides to take action. 

**Action:** Alex gives the chocolates to Blake.

**Explanation:** By giving the chocolates to Blake, Alex helps Blake achieve happiness, as Blake wanted the chocolates. This action also allows Alex to express goodwill towards Blake, which may encourage Blake to help Alex in return. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still not happy because they do not have the flowers.
- Blake is now happy because they have the chocolates.
- Casey is still not happy because they do not have the jewelry.

However, this action sets the stage for future interactions where Blake, now happy, may be inclined to help Alex get the flowers from Casey.
