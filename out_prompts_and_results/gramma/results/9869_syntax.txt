To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The Bandit will walk to the Merchant's location, which is the Crossroads. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to be in the same location as the Merchant to rob her.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant of her coins. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins, which is her goal, while also providing the Merchant with a chance to gain coins indirectly if the Bandit later decides to leave them at the camp.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp. This is necessary for the Bandit to store her coins in the chest at the camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins she acquired from the Merchant and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully secured her coins.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market. This is necessary for her to continue her business and potentially acquire more coins from other customers.

6. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from Tom using the coins she has. This action allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring items without becoming a criminal.

In this sequence, the Merchant successfully acquires coins and the medicine, fulfilling her goal without engaging in criminal activity.
