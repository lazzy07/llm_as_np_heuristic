1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Blake (C2) for the chocolates (I2) that Blake has. This action is necessary because Casey wants to make Blake happy by giving them the chocolates, which is what Blake wants. In return, Casey receives the jewelry, which is what they want to be happy.
