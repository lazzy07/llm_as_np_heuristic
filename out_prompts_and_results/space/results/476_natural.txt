Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport to the surface to help the Lizard, despite their current enmity. She believes that by showing concern for the Lizard's safety, she can foster a friendship. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help him, as she wants to make friends and ensure safety.)
   
2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** (This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, showing her intention to communicate and help rather than fight.)

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (This action is crucial as it transforms their relationship from enemies to friends, aligning with both characters' goals of making friends and being safe.)

4. **The volcano erupts.** (This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface, and since both characters are now friends, they can face this challenge together.)

In this story, Zoe's actions are focused on establishing a friendship with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy. The eruption of the volcano serves as a climax that tests their newfound friendship, but since they are now allies, they can support each other in facing the danger.
