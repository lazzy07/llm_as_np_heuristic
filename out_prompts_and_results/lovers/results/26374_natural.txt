In the living room, the three characters are trying to achieve their goals. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

1. **Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (Blake believes the chocolates are in the bathroom and wants to find them.)
2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.** (Blake has found the chocolates, which is what they want.)
3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Blake returns to the living room with the chocolates.)
4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.** (Blake is happy because they have achieved their goal of giving chocolates to Casey, who wants the jewelry.)
5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake in the living room.** (Casey is happy because they have received the chocolates, and Blake is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.)

At this point, Blake has achieved their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, and Casey is also happy because they received the jewelry. Alex remains unhappy because they still do not have the flowers.

The actions are necessary to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates, while also allowing Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by receiving the jewelry.
