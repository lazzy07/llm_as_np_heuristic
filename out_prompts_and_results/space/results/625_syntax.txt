To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while also dealing with the imminent danger of the volcano erupting. The goal is to ensure that they become friends before the volcano erupts, which will lead to one of them dying. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger on the surface.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, realizing the danger they are in, decide to put aside their differences and become friends.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to introduce the threat of the volcano erupting, which is a critical element of the story. It sets the stage for the urgency of the situation and the need for cooperation between Zoe and the Lizard.
  
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship. It also serves as a resolution to their conflict, which is essential for the story's progression.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, but since both characters are now friends, they can face the danger together, which adds a layer of emotional depth to the conclusion.
