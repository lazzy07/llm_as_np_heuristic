1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and address the imminent threat of the volcano.

As they stand together, the volcano erupts, sending lava and ash into the air. However, because they are now friends, they work together to find a safe spot away from the eruption.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This action concludes the story with the eruption, which is a significant event that affects both characters. Since they are now friends, they can face the danger together.
