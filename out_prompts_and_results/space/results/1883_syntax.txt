To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Since the Lizard is currently on the surface and in danger due to the erupting volcano, Zoe must act quickly to help the Lizard and establish a friendship.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve Zoe's goal:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to help the Lizard, as she believes the Lizard is in danger.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located, aiming to find the Lizard and ensure its safety.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship and ensuring both characters are no longer enemies.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
