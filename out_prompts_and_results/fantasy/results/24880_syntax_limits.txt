In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Given the current situation, Rory has already proposed to Talia, who accepted, which means they are on the path to happiness together. Rory has also picked up the treasure, which contributes to his wealth. 

To achieve his goal, Rory needs to ensure he is not hungry. Since he is currently not hungry, he can take the following actions:

1. **Travel from Cave to Village**: Rory can travel to the village where Vince is located. This is necessary because Vince has money, and Rory can potentially use that to further his wealth.

2. **Take Money from Vince**: Rory can take the money from Vince, which will increase his wealth and help him achieve his goal of being wealthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the village to access Vince and the money he possesses. This action is necessary for Rory to increase his wealth.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Rory will be happy (due to his relationship with Talia), wealthy (after taking the money), and not hungry (as he was not hungry before and there are no actions that would make him hungry).
