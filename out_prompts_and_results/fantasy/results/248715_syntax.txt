To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This is necessary for her to interact with Rory and Vince, as well as to secure her happiness.

3. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry. This action is included to create a scenario where she can seek help from Rory or Vince, which can lead to her happiness.

5. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia. This action is included to create a dramatic turn in the story, leading to Talia's death, which ironically fulfills her goal of being wealthy through the treasure she picked up.

6. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Vince takes the money from himself. This action is included to ensure that Vince has the money, which he can use to help Rory or himself in the future.

7. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village. This action is necessary for him to interact with Rory and potentially use the money he has.
