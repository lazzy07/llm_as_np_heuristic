To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax, the dragon, wants to eat a human and Vince is the only human present. By eating Vince, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and Vince will be dead, allowing for the next action.

2. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body**: After Vince is dead, Rory can take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Rory to gain wealth, but it also indirectly helps Vince achieve his goal of wealth since he had the money before he died.

3. **Gargax takes the treasure**: Gargax can now take the treasure that is at the cave. This action fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth.

4. **Rory becomes hungry**: Rory, having taken the money, will now become hungry. This action is necessary to reflect Rory's state after taking the money.

5. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax will eat Rory, satisfying his hunger again. This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve his goal of not being hungry.

At the end of these actions, Vince is dead but has achieved his goal of wealth through the money he had. Rory and Talia are also dead, and Gargax has the treasure and is no longer hungry.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Gargax eating Vince: This is the only way for Gargax to satisfy his hunger and allows for the next action.
- Rory taking the money: This allows Rory to gain wealth, but since Vince is dead, it also means Vince's wealth is effectively transferred.
- Gargax taking the treasure: This fulfills Gargax's goal of wealth.
- Rory becoming hungry: This reflects Rory's state after taking the money.
- Gargax eating Rory: This satisfies Gargax's hunger again and ensures that he is not hungry anymore.
