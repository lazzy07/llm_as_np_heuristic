To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to Exam Room C**: Since Jones is still in the admissions room, Hathaway will walk him to Exam Room C to assess him.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on the diagnosis from the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This will ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
