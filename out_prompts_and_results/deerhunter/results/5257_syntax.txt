Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to obtain money from the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and return to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe location.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. He uses the rifle to intimidate the clerk, which is a logical step given his greed and the presence of the loaded gun.

- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the bank with the stolen money and ensure he is not caught. It also allows him to secure his loot in a safe place.
