In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1). However, Casey (C2) and Blake (C3) are not happy because they do not have the items they want (I2 and I3, respectively). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can give Casey the item they want (I2).

**Action:**
- give(C1, I2, C2, R21)

**Explanation:**
- Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R21). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want (I2). Since Alex's goal is to make Casey happy, this action fulfills that objective.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C1, I2, C2, R21)"]
}
```
