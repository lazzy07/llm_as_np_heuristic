To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank to get the money.
   - **Explanation**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle.
   - **Explanation**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk and take the money, fulfilling his greedy desire.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will remain dead, achieving the goal of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully obtains the money while Bambi remains dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.
