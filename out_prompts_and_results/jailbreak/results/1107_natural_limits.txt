**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he has the cigarettes that the bully wants. 

Roy decides to crawl through the vents from the hallway to the gym. This action is crucial because it allows him to confront the bully without being seen, and it keeps him safe from the bully's threats while he plans his next move.

Once in the gym, Roy finds the bully distracted. He takes a moment to assess the situation and then decides to use the knife he knows is in the kitchen. He quickly sneaks back through the vents to the kitchen, retrieves the knife, and returns to the gym.

In the gym, Roy confronts the bully. With the knife in hand, he feels empowered and ready to defend himself and Ernest. In a swift motion, he takes revenge on the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten them.

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now safely escape. He puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier and heads to the hallway. From there, he makes his way to the highway, where he successfully escapes from the prison.
