To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure all patients are healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This completes the process of making all patients healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Jones**: This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy based on the assessment.
3. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
4. **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy based on the assessment.
5. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
6. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy based on the assessment.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:
