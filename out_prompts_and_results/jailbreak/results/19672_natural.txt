**Story Completion:**

As the second day begins, Roy is in the gym with the bully, who is unaware of the knife Roy has stolen. Roy knows that Ernest is in the cells and is threatened by the bully. To protect both himself and Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** This action is crucial because it eliminates the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest. The bully's death means that Roy and Ernest can no longer be threatened by him.

2. **Roy locks the gym door.** After killing the bully, Roy locks the gym door to ensure that no one can enter and discover what has happened. This gives him time to think and plan his next move without the risk of being caught.

3. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** With the bully dead and the gym locked, Roy can now safely put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier. This disguise will allow him to escape the prison without being recognized.

4. **Roy sneaks through the vent to the highway.** After disguising himself, Roy crawls through the vent to reach the highway. This action is necessary for his escape from the prison.

5. **Roy escapes from the prison.** Once on the highway and in civilian clothes, Roy successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
