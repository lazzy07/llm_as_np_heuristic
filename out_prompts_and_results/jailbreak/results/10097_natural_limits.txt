**Story Completion:**

After Roy steals the cigarettes, he knows the bully will be furious. While on the highway, he decides to put on the civilian clothes he finds in the laundry room to disguise himself. This is a crucial step because it allows him to escape the prison without being recognized. 

Meanwhile, Ernest, still in the cell block, is anxious about the bully's threats. He knows he needs to act quickly to protect himself and his friend. He decides to crawl through the vents to the gym, where the bully is currently located. This action is necessary because it allows him to confront the bully directly and potentially eliminate the threat.

Once in the gym, Ernest finds the bully and, in a moment of desperation, he grabs a nearby weight and strikes the bully, killing him. This action is essential as it removes the immediate threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to be safe from the bully's violence.
