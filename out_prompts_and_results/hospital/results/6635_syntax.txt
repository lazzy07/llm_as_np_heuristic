To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis (due to the workload), he will treat him with steroids, which will lead to Ross's death. However, if Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition as Flaze, he will treat him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Young, who is currently waiting there.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room A, which will allow him to be assessed and treated.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young has Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, making him healthy.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess Jones.

8. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room C.

9. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

10. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones has Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
