After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain some energy. However, he is still focused on his greed and the desire for money. 

Next, Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the bank clerk. Since he is still armed with the rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. 

Finally, Bubba steals the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the clerk while threatening him with the rifle.

This sequence of actions is the shortest way for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

  "plan": [
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
