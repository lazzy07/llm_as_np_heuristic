Tom is at the Crossroads, carrying the medicine he stole from the merchant. He knows that the guard is at the market, and the bandit is also at the crossroads. To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to walk directly to the cottage.

**Action:**
- walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, while carrying the medicine. Since there are no other actions required to achieve his goal, this single action suffices.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{ "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"] }
```
