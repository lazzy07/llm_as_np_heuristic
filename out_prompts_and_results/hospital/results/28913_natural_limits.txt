Dr. Hathaway is currently at Patient Room B, where Ross is experiencing a fever. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to treat Ross. Since Ross is already in Patient Room B, Hathaway can treat him without needing to admit him again. 

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze (the disease associated with fever). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Ross's symptoms and aims to make him healthy. Since Ross is experiencing fever, the treatment with antibiotics will cure him.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway can then focus on the other patient, Young, who is currently in Admissions and experiencing a rash. 

2. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him.

3. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and observes a rash. This action is necessary to confirm Young's symptoms and prepare for the appropriate treatment.

4. Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis (the disease associated with rash). This action is necessary to ensure Young receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.

By treating both Ross and Young, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
