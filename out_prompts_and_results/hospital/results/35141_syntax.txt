To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young is already assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial for the same reason as assessing Young.

3. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This is also necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is currently unassigned and has an unknown symptom.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the last step needed to ensure all patients are assessed.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This is the final action needed to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients and achieve their goal of making them healthy.
