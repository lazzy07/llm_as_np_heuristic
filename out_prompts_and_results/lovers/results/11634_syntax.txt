To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22). This is necessary because Blake is the one who can then give the flowers to Alex.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to facilitate the exchange of items.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Blake, as Blake is the intermediary who can then give the flowers to Alex.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex, which directly satisfies Alex's desire and makes them happy.
