Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the dangerous surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. She knows she needs to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are safe from the immediate danger of the volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, solidifying their newfound friendship and ensuring both characters are safe from the eruption. This action reinforces their bond and keeps them out of danger.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe. This event serves as a climax to the story, demonstrating the importance of their friendship and cooperation.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
