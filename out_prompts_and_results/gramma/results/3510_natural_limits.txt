The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the medicine is now unguarded. She quickly walks over to the merchant's body and loots the medicine. With the medicine in her possession, she returns to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her loot and keep the medicine for herself.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Walk to the Merchant's Body**: The bandit needs to get to the medicine, which is now with the merchant's corpse.
2. **Loot the Medicine**: This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins or items as possible, specifically the medicine.
3. **Walk Back to the Bandit Camp**: This ensures the bandit can secure her loot in a safe location.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying the medicine.
