**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, first admits Ross to Exam Room B and Young to Exam Room C. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of both patients.

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B, discovering he has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. This reduces Hathaway's workload back to 1.

Then, Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C, discovering he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully making him healthy as well. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 0.

Finally, Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Jones, who is still in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway admits him to Exam Room A and assesses him. As Jones is alive and healthy, Hathaway concludes that he is not suffering from either disease.
