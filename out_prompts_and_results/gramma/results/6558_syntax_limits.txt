Tom is currently at the market, having just looted the medicine from the merchant. The bandit, armed with a sword, is at the crossroads and has just walked to the market. The guard is also at the market, unaware of the bandit's presence. 

To achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, Tom needs to leave the market and head to the cottage. However, he must be cautious of the bandit, who may try to rob him.

Since Tom is not armed, he cannot attack or rob anyone. The best course of action for him is to walk directly to the cottage with the medicine he has looted. The guard is present, which provides some safety against the bandit.

Thus, the only action Tom takes is to walk from the market to the cottage.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to leave the market and reach his goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine. It is the only necessary action for him to achieve his goal.
