To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry to be happy, and Blake is willing to trade since they want to help Alex (C1) be happy, which aligns with Casey's goal.

2. **put_down(C2, I3, R22)**: After the trade, Blake puts down the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R22). This action is included to ensure that the jewelry is now available in the room for Casey to pick up.

3. **pick_up(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from the dining room (R22). This action is crucial as it allows Casey to finally obtain the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The trade allows Casey to exchange an item they have for the item they want, which is essential for achieving their goal.
- Putting down the jewelry ensures it is accessible for Casey to pick up.
- Picking up the jewelry is the final step that leads to Casey's happiness.
