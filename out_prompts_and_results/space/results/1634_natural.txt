1. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation. Since they are not fighting, this is a safe way to start building a relationship.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendly relationship. This action is crucial for both characters to feel safe and healthy, as it aligns with their goals of making friends.

3. **The volcano erupts**: This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting. It serves as a dramatic climax, showcasing the danger of the surface and reinforcing the need for Zoe and the Lizard to work together.

4. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: After making peace, Zoe can teleport to the spaceship, ensuring her safety from the eruption. This action is necessary for her survival.

5. **The Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard remains in the cave, safe from the eruption. This action emphasizes the Lizard's role as the guardian of the planet, ensuring its own safety.
