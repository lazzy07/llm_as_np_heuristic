Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A with a workload of 3. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients assigned to the exam rooms. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment. 
   
2. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that Ross also has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids as well, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.
