To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, having seen Tom at the Crossroads, decides to rob him. She successfully takes the coin he was carrying, increasing her wealth.
- With the coin in hand, the Bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store her newly acquired coin in the chest, achieving her goal.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins or having them in the chest.
