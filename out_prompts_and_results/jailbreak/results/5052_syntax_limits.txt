**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest realizes he is in danger from the bully, who is likely to retaliate for stealing his cigarettes. He knows he needs to find a way to escape. Meanwhile, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway, ready to make his move.

To ensure his safety and to help his friend, Roy decides to take action. He crawls back through the vents to the gym, where he knows the bully is currently located. Once inside, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening either him or Ernest.
