To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to confirm the symptoms. Since Young is already in Exam Room A and has a symptom (SymptomB), this action is necessary to determine the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. Since Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids.

3. **Walk Jones to Exam Room B**: After treating Young, Hathaway will need to admit Jones to an exam room. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will walk Jones to Exam Room B to prepare for assessment.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the assessment results. If Jones has symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics.

By following these steps, Young will be treated successfully, and Jones will also have the opportunity to be treated, ensuring both patients are healthy.
