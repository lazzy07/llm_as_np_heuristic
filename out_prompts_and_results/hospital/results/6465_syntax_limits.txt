### Story Completion

After the events that have already occurred, Hathaway decides to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. Since Ross is in the admissions room, Hathaway will first walk to the admissions room to assess him. 
2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room C.
3. **Treat Ross**: If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If he shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids.
4. **Treat Young**: Similarly, if Young shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If he shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids.

This sequence ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat both patients, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
