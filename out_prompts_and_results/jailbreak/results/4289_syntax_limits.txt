**Story Completion:**

After finishing their chores in the kitchen, Roy and Ernest are both aware of the threat posed by the bully, who is currently in the gym. Roy, having stolen the pack of cigarettes earlier, knows that the bully will be looking for them. To ensure their safety and to escape the prison, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Disguise (Roy, Clothes, Kitchen)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will help him blend in and avoid detection when he attempts to escape.
