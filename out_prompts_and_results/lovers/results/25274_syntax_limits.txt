In the current situation, Casey is unhappy because they do not have the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). To achieve their goal of happiness, Casey needs to acquire the jewelry. 

Since Alex is already happy with the flowers (I1) they received from Blake, and Blake is currently unhappy because they do not have the chocolates (I2), the best course of action is for Casey to trade with Blake. 

Here’s the action that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Blake for the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R21). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this trade, the situation will be:
- Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the jewelry (I3) and will be unhappy, but this does not affect Casey's goal.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- The trade is the only action needed to ensure Casey gets what they want, fulfilling their desire for happiness.
