To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers to be happy. Since Casey is currently in the living room with the flowers, they can give them to Alex directly.

2. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey, which may help Blake achieve their own goal later, but it is not necessary for Alex's immediate goal.

3. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to achieve their goal of happiness, as they want the chocolates. It also shows that Blake is taking action to improve their own situation.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.**  
   - This action is included to help Blake achieve their goal of happiness, as they want the chocolates. It also allows Casey to be happy with the jewelry they already have.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
