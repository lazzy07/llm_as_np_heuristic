Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, establishing a friendly relationship. To ensure their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and ensure that both she and the Lizard remain safe from the eruption.

**Action:**
- teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)

**Explanation:**
This action is taken because Zoe wants to ensure her safety by moving to the spaceship, which is a safe location away from the erupting volcano. By doing this, she also demonstrates her commitment to her own health and safety, which aligns with the Lizard's goal of being healthy and safe as well. The action does not anger the Lizard since they are no longer fighting and have made peace.
