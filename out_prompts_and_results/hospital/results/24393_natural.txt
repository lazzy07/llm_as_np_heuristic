**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Unfortunately, since Jones is experiencing Unknown, this treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Dr. Hathaway then walks back to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he is also experiencing Unknown. With a workload of 2, Hathaway can still make an accurate assessment.

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. This treatment is also incorrect, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. Young is experiencing Unknown as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly thinking he has Flaze. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.
