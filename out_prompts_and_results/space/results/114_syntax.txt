To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is crucial because it places Zoe in the dangerous location where the eruption will occur, setting her up to be affected by the volcano.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface during the eruption.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: This action is included to ensure that despite the circumstances, Zoe and the Lizard have a moment of friendship before the eruption. It signifies that they have established a bond, even if it is brief.

The final sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing for the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard to be solidified before the tragic event.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process.
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Moves Zoe to the surface where the eruption will take place.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Causes the volcano to erupt, leading to Zoe's death.
- **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
