To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Currently, Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is with Casey (C2). 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to offer in exchange for the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This is necessary to facilitate the trade.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to offer something in exchange for the jewelry.

5. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) with Alex for the chocolates (I2). This is the final action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
