To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to confront Tom, who is carrying the medicine and has just looted the coins from the Merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is unarmed and carrying the medicine. The Bandit will take the TomCoin from Tom, increasing her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads to head towards the Bandit Camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the Market and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
