**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway is cautious but believes Young is alive. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, assuming they might have Flaze, as it is the only disease that can be treated with antibiotics. Young responds positively to the treatment and becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C and assesses him. Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze as well. Jones becomes healthy after the treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B and assesses him. Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, assuming he has Jarkis. Ross also becomes healthy after the treatment.

With all patients treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
