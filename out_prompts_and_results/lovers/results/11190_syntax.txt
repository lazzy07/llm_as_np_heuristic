To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21). This allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating a potential trade or exchange of items.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the flowers (I1). This is crucial because it allows Casey to give Alex the item they want.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
