Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, aware of the Lizard's presence in the cave. She knows that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and wants to make friends. However, the Lizard is currently in the cave, and Zoe is on the surface, which makes it difficult for them to connect. 

To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, Zoe decides to walk to the cave. This action is necessary because it allows her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

Once Zoe arrives at the cave, she can initiate a conversation and express her desire to be friends, which aligns with both of their goals of being healthy, safe, and making connections with other creatures.

**Story:**
1. Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: This action is taken to bring Zoe to the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact and work towards friendship. It is the only action needed to achieve the goal of making friends, as they cannot become friends unless they are in the same location.
