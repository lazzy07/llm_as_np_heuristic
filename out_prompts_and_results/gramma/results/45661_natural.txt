To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to leave the market and return to a location where they can access their chest of coins.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to reach the camp where the coins are stored in the chest.

3. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action is essential for the bandit to achieve their goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- The bandit first leaves the market to avoid any confrontation with the guard and the hero, who are both present and armed.
- By returning to the bandit camp, the bandit can safely access the coins without the risk of being attacked or robbed.
- Finally, looting the coins from the chest fulfills the bandit's goal of accumulating wealth.
