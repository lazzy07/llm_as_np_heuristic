To achieve the goal of either Ernest or Roy overcoming the bully's threats or one of them dying, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Roy, Hall)**: Roy moves from the cell block to the hallway to access the gym and help Ernest.
   - This action is necessary for Roy to reach Ernest and potentially assist him against the bully.

2. **lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**: Roy locks the gym door after entering, preventing the bully from escaping.
   - This action is crucial to ensure that the bully cannot flee and that Roy and Ernest can confront him without fear of retaliation.

3. **steal(Roy, Knife, Kitchen)**: Roy steals the knife from the kitchen while in the hallway.
   - This action is necessary for Roy to arm himself and prepare for a confrontation with the bully.

4. **revenge(Roy, Bully, Gym)**: Roy kills the bully in the gym.
   - This action allows Roy to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Ernest are no longer in danger.

5. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes in the hallway to disguise himself.
   - This action is essential for Roy to prepare for an escape from the prison without being recognized.

6. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Roy escapes from the prison using the disguise.
   - This action fulfills the goal of ensuring Roy is alive and free from the threats of the bully and prison life.

This sequence of actions leads to Roy successfully escaping the prison after eliminating the bully, thus achieving the desired outcome.
