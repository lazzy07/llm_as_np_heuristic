Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to her spaceship for safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to his guardianship of the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, teleports to the surface to confront Zoe. 

Upon arrival, the Lizard finds Zoe and, instead of attacking, he attempts to communicate. Zoe, surprised but intrigued, listens to the Lizard's concerns about the surface and the dangers it poses. They both realize that they share a common goal: to be healthy and safe and to make friends. 

As they talk, the volcano begins to erupt, creating a sense of urgency. Zoe and the Lizard, now understanding each other, decide to work together to escape the danger. They teleport back to the spaceship together, forming a friendship in the process.
