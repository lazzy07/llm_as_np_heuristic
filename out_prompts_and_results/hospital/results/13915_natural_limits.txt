Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing the patients in the admissions room to determine their conditions. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, as they need to understand their symptoms to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.** This action is crucial because it allows Dr. Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, this assessment will help determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** Assuming that Young has Jarkis (as Dr. Hathaway's workload is high and they might make a mistake), this action is taken to treat Young. If Young indeed has Jarkis, this treatment will make Young healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient becomes healthy, which aligns with their goal of having all hospital patients be healthy.
