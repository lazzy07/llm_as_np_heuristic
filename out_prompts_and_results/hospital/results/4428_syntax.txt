To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will also assess Young in Exam Room A (after Jones) to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment as well.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: Since Ross is currently in the Admissions room and needs to be assessed and treated, Hathaway will walk Ross to Exam Room A.

6. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify his condition.

7. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is essential to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating patients**: Administering the correct treatment is necessary for the patients to recover.
- **Walking Ross to Exam Room A**: This action is required to bring Ross into the treatment process since he was initially in the Admissions room.
