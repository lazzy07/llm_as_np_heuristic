In this story, the merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The simplest way for the merchant to achieve this is to sell the medicine to the hero, who is currently at the crossroads and has the medicine.

1. The merchant, who is at the camp, walks to the crossroads to meet the hero. This action is necessary because the merchant needs to be at the same location as the hero to sell the medicine.

2. Once at the crossroads, the merchant sells the medicine to the hero for the hero's coin. This action allows the merchant to gain a coin without committing any crime, thus achieving her goal.

The story concludes with the merchant successfully acquiring a coin while remaining a lawful character.
