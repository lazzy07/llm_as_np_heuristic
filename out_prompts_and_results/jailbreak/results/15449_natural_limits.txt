**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, still in the gym, realizes that the bully is focused on him and not aware of Ernest's presence in the laundry room. Roy decides to take a risk. He quickly approaches the bully and, using the pack of cigarettes as a distraction, he taunts the bully, saying, "You want these? Come and get them!" This action is intended to draw the bully's attention away from Ernest and create an opportunity for both of them to escape.

The bully, enraged by the taunt, lunges at Roy. In the chaos, Roy manages to slip away and rushes to the hallway. He knows that if he can get to the laundry room, he can warn Ernest and they can escape together. However, the bully, furious and determined, follows Roy into the hallway.

In the hallway, Roy quickly locks the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten either of them anymore. With the bully locked away, Roy rushes to the laundry room, where he finds Ernest. They quickly put on the civilian clothes that are stored there, disguising themselves.

Now disguised, they make their way to the highway. With the bully trapped and unable to threaten them, they successfully escape from the prison, leaving the dangers behind.
