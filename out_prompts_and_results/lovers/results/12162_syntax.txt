To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) to be closer to Alex and Casey.
2. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) to retrieve the chocolates (I2) that they want.
3. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the flowers (I1) from the living room (R21) since they are now in the same room.
4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21).
