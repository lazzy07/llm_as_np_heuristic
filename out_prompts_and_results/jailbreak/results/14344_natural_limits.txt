**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action. He sneaks out of the kitchen and moves to the hallway. From there, he crawls through the vents to the gym, where the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, Ernest confronts the bully and, using the knife he stole earlier, he kills the bully. With the bully out of the way, Ernest feels safe and can now focus on finding a way to escape the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Move to the hallway:** This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where the bully is located. It allows him to escape the kitchen and approach the bully without being seen.
   
2. **Crawl through the vents to the gym:** This action is crucial as it provides a stealthy way for Ernest to enter the gym without alerting the bully, allowing him to catch the bully off guard.

3. **Kill the bully with the knife:** This is the final and most critical action. By eliminating the bully, Ernest removes the immediate threat to both himself and Roy, ensuring their safety and allowing Ernest to focus on escaping.
