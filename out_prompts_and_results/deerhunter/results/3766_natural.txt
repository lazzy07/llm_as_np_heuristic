To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling satisfied after his recent actions. He has successfully stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and shot Bambi, which has provided him with the means to survive. He checks his pockets and confirms that he has 1 money. Bubba is hungry, but he knows he can eat Bambi later if he needs to. For now, he feels accomplished and content with what he has.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba stands in the forest** - This establishes Bubba's current location and state of mind.
2. **Bubba checks his pockets** - This action confirms that he has achieved his goal of having 1 money.
3. **Bubba feels accomplished and content** - This reflects Bubba's emotional state, indicating that he is satisfied with his current situation.
