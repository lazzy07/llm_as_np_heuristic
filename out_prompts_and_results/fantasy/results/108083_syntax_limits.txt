In this story, Vince's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, he needs to ensure he has money and treasure, and he also needs to maintain his happiness. 

Here's the shortest story where Vince achieves his goal:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the Cave where Talia is located. This is necessary because Talia has accepted his marriage proposal, and he needs to be with her to achieve happiness.

2. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Vince marries Talia in the Cave. This action makes both Vince and Talia happy, fulfilling Vince's goal of happiness.

3. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action increases his wealth, which is another part of his goal.

4. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the Village with Talia and the treasure. This is necessary for him to be in a safe place with Talia and to enjoy their new life together.

5. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry, but since he is now married to Talia, he can rely on her for support.

6. **accept(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which has already been done, but it reinforces their relationship and happiness.

In the end, Vince is happy because he is married to Talia, wealthy because he has the treasure, and he is not hungry because he can rely on Talia.
