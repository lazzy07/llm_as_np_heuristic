**Story Completion:**

1. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to move closer to his goal of reaching the cottage while carrying the medicine.

2. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action allows Tom to finally reach his desired location, the cottage, with the medicine he looted from the merchant.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- The first action of walking from the market to the crossroads is essential because it positions Tom closer to the cottage, which is his ultimate goal. Since he is currently at the market, this is the only logical move to make progress toward his destination.

- The second action of walking from the crossroads to the cottage is the final step that allows Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. 

No other actions are necessary because Tom already has the medicine and does not need to interact with any other characters or items to reach his goal.
