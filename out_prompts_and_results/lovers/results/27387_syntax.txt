To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey (C2) moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R21) where Alex (C1) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C3) in the bedroom (R21). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy, which is part of their own happiness.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the bedroom (R21) to the dining room (R22) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary for Blake to pick up the item they want.

4. **pick_up(C3, I2, R22)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R22). This action is essential for Blake to achieve their own happiness.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves back to the bedroom (R21) to be with Casey and Alex. This is important for maintaining the connection between the characters.

6. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2) in the bedroom (R21). This action allows Casey to receive an item that contributes to their happiness.

After these actions, the happiness of the characters is as follows:
- Casey (C2) is happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake (C3) is happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Alex (C1) remains unhappy because they still do not have the flowers (I1), but the focus is on Casey's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "give(C3, I2, C2, R21)"
