To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and hungry, decides to shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba wants the money, and the clerk has it. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk without any repercussions.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located and eat her. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only character with money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money for himself, satisfying his greed.

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi, who is alive and in the forest, is killed and consumed by Bubba. This fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead.

The final outcome will be that Bubba has the money from the bank clerk, and Bambi is dead, achieving both goals.
