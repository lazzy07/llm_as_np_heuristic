To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with Blake, who is in the living room.

2. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to be closer to Casey and Blake. This is important for Alex to communicate and potentially trade items.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to join Alex and Casey. This is necessary for Blake to interact with both characters and facilitate the exchange of items.

4. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex tells Blake that they want the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Blake of their desire, which may lead to a trade or gift.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the crucial action that fulfills Alex's desire and makes them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
