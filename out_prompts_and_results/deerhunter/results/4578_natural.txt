To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal from the clerk.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and the clerk is the only character with money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money, as he successfully takes the clerk's money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead from the earlier events.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
