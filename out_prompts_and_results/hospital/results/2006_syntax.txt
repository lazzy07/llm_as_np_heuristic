To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room C to Admissions**: Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Young, who is currently unassigned to an exam room.

4. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

5. **Treat Jones in Exam Room A**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Ross based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment_for_Jones, PatientRoomA)",
