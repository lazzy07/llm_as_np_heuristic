To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, she will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the treasure, Talia will travel back to the village. This is necessary for her to interact with the other characters and potentially secure her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal. By marrying Vince, she will achieve happiness, as both characters will be happy after the marriage.

4. **take(Vince, Money, Gargax, Village)**: Since Gargax is in the village and has no wealth, Vince can take the money from Gargax. This action is necessary for Vince to become wealthy, which aligns with Talia's goal of being wealthy as well.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **pickup**: Talia picks up the treasure to increase her wealth.
- **travel**: Talia travels back to the village to marry Vince and secure her happiness.
- **marry**: Talia marries Vince, achieving her happiness.
- **take**: Vince takes the money from Gargax, ensuring that Talia's goal of wealth is also met through their relationship.
