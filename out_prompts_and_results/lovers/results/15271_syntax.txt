To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where the jewelry is located (R21). This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is important for Alex to be with the other characters after obtaining the item.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to themselves, which is a way to signify that they now possess the item they wanted. This action is necessary to fulfill Alex's desire.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
