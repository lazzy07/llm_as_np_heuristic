To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba obtaining the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he is and head to the bank to get the money. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba confirms his greed and desire for money. This action solidifies his intention to keep the money he has just taken.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten Bambi, to the bank where the clerk is located.
