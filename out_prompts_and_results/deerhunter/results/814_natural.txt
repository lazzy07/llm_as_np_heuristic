Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. He sees Bambi, a deer, and decides to shoot her to satisfy his hunger. After shooting Bambi, he can eat her, which will alleviate his hunger. With his hunger satisfied, Bubba can then return to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money he desires.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger.
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and acquires the money he desires.
