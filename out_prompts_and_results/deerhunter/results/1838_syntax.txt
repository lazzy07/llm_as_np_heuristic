To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba acquiring the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he is currently located and go to the bank to confront the bank clerk. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain the money.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Although Bubba already has a loaded rifle, we can include this action to emphasize that he is prepared for any confrontation. This action is included to ensure that Bubba is ready to intimidate the clerk if necessary.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the threat of his rifle. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action reinforces Bubba's readiness to use the rifle if needed, although it may not be strictly necessary since he already has the rifle loaded.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is the key to achieving the goal of Bubba obtaining the money.
