To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Alex in the living room.**
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Casey picks up jewelry in the living room.**
   - This action is included to ensure that Casey can also achieve their goal of happiness. Since the jewelry is in the living room, Casey can pick it up and be happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.

This sequence of actions allows Alex to achieve their goal while also considering the happiness of the other characters.
