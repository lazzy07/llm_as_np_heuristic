To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action has already been taken, so the volcano is in the process of erupting.
2. **erupt(Surface)** - This action will cause the volcano to erupt fully, leading to the death of any characters on the surface.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - This action will allow Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, but it must occur before the eruption kills Zoe.

Given the current situation, Zoe is on the surface and the Lizard is in the cave. To ensure that both the eruption occurs and the friendship is established, we can have Zoe teleport to the cave to make peace with the Lizard before the eruption happens.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)** - Zoe teleports to the spaceship to avoid the eruption.
2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Cave)** - Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave where the Lizard is located.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Zoe and the Lizard make peace, establishing their friendship.
4. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is now in the cave, she is safe, and the Lizard remains safe as well.

However, since we need a character to die, we can modify the plan slightly to ensure that the Lizard is on the surface when the eruption occurs. 

Here’s the final sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)** - The Lizard walks to the surface, putting itself in danger.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe and the Lizard make peace on the surface.
3. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, killing the Lizard.

This sequence ensures that the Lizard dies in the eruption while Zoe and the Lizard become friends just before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: This action places the Lizard on the surface, making it vulnerable to the eruption.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in the Lizard's death.
