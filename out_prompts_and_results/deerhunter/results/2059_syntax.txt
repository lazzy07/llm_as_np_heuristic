To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to steal from the bank clerk. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to threaten the clerk and take the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money from the clerk, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Now that Bubba has the money, he decides to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it aligns with his needs after the theft.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: Bubba will then go back to his house. This action is necessary for him to find food to eat.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer. This action is necessary because it satisfies his hunger and allows him to utilize the resources available to him.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
