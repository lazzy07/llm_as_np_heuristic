The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She knows that the guard is preoccupied with the merchant and the hero, who are both unarmed. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where she can confront the merchant directly.

Once at the market, the bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine that the merchant is carrying. This action is successful because the merchant is unarmed and cannot defend herself. With the medicine in hand, the bandit now has a valuable item that she can either keep or sell later.

The bandit then walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely store the medicine in her chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest.
