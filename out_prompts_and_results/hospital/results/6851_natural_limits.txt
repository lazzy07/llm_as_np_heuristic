Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A, where Ross is experiencing Fever. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway must treat Ross for Flaze, the disease associated with fever. However, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake due to the high workload. 

To reduce the workload and ensure Ross receives the correct treatment, Hathaway will first assess Ross again to confirm the symptoms. This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to verify the diagnosis before proceeding with treatment. 

Next, Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross** - This action is necessary to confirm that Ross is indeed experiencing Fever and to avoid any potential mistakes in treatment due to Hathaway's high workload.
2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics** - This action is essential to cure Ross of Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.

After these actions, Ross will be healthy, and Hathaway will have successfully achieved their goal.
