To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: Gargax will take the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary because Gargax needs to acquire wealth, and Vince is currently dead, allowing Gargax to take the money without any consequences.

2. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax will travel to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is essential for Gargax to reach the treasure, which will further increase their wealth.

3. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax will pick up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

4. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax will eat Talia, who is still alive in the village. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Gargax is currently hungry.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goals of being wealthy (by acquiring both the money and the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Talia).
