To complete the story where the Secret Agent achieves their goal of killing the Mastermind, we need to ensure that the Secret Agent acquires the gun and then moves to the Mastermind's location to execute the kill. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Office to search for the gun. This is necessary because the Secret Agent needs the gun to kill the Mastermind.

2. **find(SecretAgent, Gun, Office)**: The Secret Agent finds the gun in the Office. This action is crucial as it provides the weapon needed to carry out the kill.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves back to the Lobby. This is necessary to position themselves for the kill since the Mastermind is believed to be in the Headquarters.

4. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Courtyard)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Courtyard. This is part of the path to reach the Mastermind's location.

5. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Dropbox)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Courtyard to the Dropbox. This is another step towards reaching the Mastermind.

6. **move(SecretAgent, Dropbox, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Dropbox to the Headquarters, where the Mastermind is located.

7. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Headquarters)**: Finally, the Secret Agent kills the Mastermind using the gun in the Headquarters. This action fulfills the Secret Agent's goal of ensuring the Mastermind is dead.
