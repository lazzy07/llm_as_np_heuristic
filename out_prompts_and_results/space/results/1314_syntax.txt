To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is already completed in the current situation, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in a safe location away from the dangerous surface, as the surface is currently marked as dangerous.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave, ensuring that both characters are in the same safe location. This reinforces their friendship and keeps them away from the dangers of the surface.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface will begin to erupt. This action is included to create a sense of urgency and danger, emphasizing the need for both characters to be in a safe location.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, confirming the danger of the surface. This action serves to highlight the importance of the characters being in the cave, as they are now safe from the eruption.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe, as well as making a friend in Zoe.
