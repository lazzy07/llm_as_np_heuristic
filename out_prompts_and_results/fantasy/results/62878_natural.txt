To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. Gargax eats Talia. 
2. Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's body. 
3. Gargax eats the money from Vince's body.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Gargax needs to eliminate Talia to access the treasure she possesses. By eating her, Gargax also satisfies their hunger.
   
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's body**: After eating Talia, Gargax can now take the treasure she had. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **Gargax eats the money from Vince's body**: Since Gargax has already eaten Talia, they can now take the money from Vince's body. This action further increases Gargax's wealth and ensures they are not hungry.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring both the treasure and the money) and not hungry (having eaten both Talia and Vince).
