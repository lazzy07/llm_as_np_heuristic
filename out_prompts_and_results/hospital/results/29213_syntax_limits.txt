**Story Completion:**

After assessing Ross in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by SymptomA (fever). To ensure Ross's health, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze.

Next, Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B, as Young is still in the admissions room and needs to be assessed. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are attended to.

Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room B. Young shows no symptoms yet, but Hathaway believes it is important to monitor him closely. 

Finally, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing that he might have Jarkis, even though he shows no symptoms. This is a mistake due to Hathaway's increased workload, but it is a necessary action to ensure Young is treated.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Assess (Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and confirm he has Flaze.
2. **Treat (Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: This action is crucial for Ross's recovery, as it directly addresses his condition.
3. **Admit (Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB)**: This action is needed to ensure Young is seen and assessed, as he is still in the admissions room.
4. **Assess (Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is important to monitor Young's health, even if he shows no symptoms.
5. **Treat (Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Although this is a mistake, it is necessary to ensure Young receives treatment.
