To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, and Bambi remains alive since Bubba did not interact with Bambi in this sequence.
