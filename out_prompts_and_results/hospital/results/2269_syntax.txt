To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is also in the admissions room. This will help determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to identify his symptoms as well. This is crucial for ensuring that all patients are treated appropriately.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing all patients, Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room C. This is necessary to provide Ross with a dedicated space for treatment.

5. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will then admit Jones to Exam Room A, where he can be treated.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

8. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room B for treatment.
