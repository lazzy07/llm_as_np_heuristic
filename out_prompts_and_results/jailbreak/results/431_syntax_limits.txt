**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry and kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Roy is still in the cell block and that the bully is in the gym, but he feels threatened by the bully's presence. To ensure his safety and to help Roy, Ernest decides to take action.

1. **Lock the Gym**: Ernest locks the gym door from the hallway. This action prevents the bully from coming out and threatening him or Roy. By locking the gym, Ernest creates a safe space for himself and Roy, reducing the immediate threat they face.

2. **Disguise and Escape**: After locking the gym, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. Now disguised, he makes his way to the highway. This action allows him to escape from the prison without being recognized, ensuring his survival and freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Locking the Gym**: This action is crucial as it neutralizes the bully's ability to threaten Ernest and Roy, allowing them to avoid confrontation and potential harm.
- **Disguising and Escaping**: By putting on the civilian clothes and escaping, Ernest achieves his primary goal of staying alive and avoiding threats, while also gaining freedom from the prison.
