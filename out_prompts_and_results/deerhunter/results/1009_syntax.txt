To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he loaded with ammunition to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle between Bubba and the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then decides to return to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but can be seen as a way for Bubba to escape after committing the act.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba shoots Bambi, the deer, in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead, achieving both objectives.
