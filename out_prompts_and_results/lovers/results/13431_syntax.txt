To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Blake to have the item they want.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates to be happy.

5. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the flowers (I1). This is necessary for Alex to get the item they want.

6. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room. This is necessary for Alex to achieve happiness.

7. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Blake and Casey. This is necessary for Alex to be with the other characters after achieving their goal.

At this point, Alex has the flowers (I1) and is happy. The actions taken ensure that each character is working towards their own happiness while also considering the happiness of others.
