In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex is currently unhappy because they want item I1 (the jewelry), which is with Casey. Blake can help Alex by facilitating a trade between Alex and Casey.

To achieve this, Blake can tell Casey that Alex wants the chocolates (I2), which is a lie, but it will prompt Casey to consider trading. Then, Blake can facilitate the trade between Alex and Casey, allowing Alex to receive the jewelry they want, thus making both Alex and Blake happy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(Blake, Casey, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the chocolates. This action is necessary to mislead Casey into thinking that Alex is interested in I2, prompting a potential trade.

2. **trade(Casey, I1, Alex, I2, R22)**: Blake facilitates the trade between Casey and Alex, where Casey gives Alex the jewelry (I1) in exchange for the chocolates (I2). This action is crucial as it directly leads to Alex receiving the item they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake will be happy because Alex is happy.
- Casey will be unhappy because they have traded away the jewelry but will still have the chocolates (I2).

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(Blake, Casey, I2, R22)",
    "trade(Casey, I1, Alex, I2, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This story is concise and effectively achieves Blake's goal of being happy by ensuring Alex receives the item they want.
