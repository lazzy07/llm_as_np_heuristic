Zoe, feeling safe aboard her spaceship, decides to teleport to the surface to explore the planet further. However, she is unaware that the Lizard, the guardian of the surface, is nearby and perceives her presence as a potential threat. The Lizard, wanting to protect its home and establish a friendship, decides to walk from the cave to the surface to confront Zoe.

Upon arriving at the surface, the Lizard sees Zoe and realizes that they can communicate rather than fight. The Lizard approaches Zoe and, instead of attacking, extends a friendly gesture.
