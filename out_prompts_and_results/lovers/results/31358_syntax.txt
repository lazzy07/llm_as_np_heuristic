To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to get closer to the item they want, which is in the same room as Casey.
2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to give to Casey in exchange for the jewelry.
3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake.
4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3). This is a strategic move to make Casey happy, as Casey wants the chocolates.
5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, making them happy.
