**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to act quickly to help her patients, decides to assess Young first in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis (the rash) instead of Flaze (the fever). 

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit the remaining patients.

3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A, increasing her workload to 3 again.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C, increasing her workload to 4.

Now, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.

5. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. Since Jones does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.

7. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

8. **Treat Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids. Since Ross does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, despite the mistakes made due to her high workload, lead to the conclusion that all patients have been treated, albeit unsuccessfully. However, her goal of attempting to help all patients remains intact.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is necessary to progress the story towards the conclusion where Dr. Hathaway attempts to treat all patients.
- The assessments and treatments are crucial to demonstrate the consequences of high workload and the resulting mistakes.
- The admissions of Jones and Ross are necessary to ensure all patients are accounted for and treated.
