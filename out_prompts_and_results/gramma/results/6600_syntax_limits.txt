Tom, now armed with a sword and carrying the medicine, stands in the market surrounded by the merchant, the guard, and the bandit. Knowing that he needs to get back to the cottage with the medicine, he decides to take a bold action. 

Tom chooses to attack the bandit, who is also armed. This action is necessary because the bandit poses a threat to Tom's safety and could potentially steal the medicine. By attacking, Tom aims to eliminate the bandit and ensure he can safely return to the cottage.

Tom successfully attacks the bandit, killing her. With the bandit out of the way, Tom can now loot the bandit's sword and any coins she may have had, but his primary goal is to ensure he can leave the market safely with the medicine.

After the attack, Tom walks back to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
