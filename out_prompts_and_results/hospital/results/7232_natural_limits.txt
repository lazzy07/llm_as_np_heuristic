Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds with the assessment. After assessing Jones, she mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. She treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, but fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis and remains alive. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. She then assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. With her workload now at 2, she correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to admit Young to Patient Room C. She assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. With her workload at 2, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. However, Young does not have Jarkis and remains alive.

In the end, all patients are alive, and Dr. Hathaway has treated Ross correctly, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
