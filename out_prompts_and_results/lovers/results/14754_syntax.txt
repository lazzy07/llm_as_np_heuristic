To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake is currently unhappy** because they do not have the item they want (I2 - chocolates). 
2. **Alex is happy** because they have the item they want (I1 - flowers).
3. **Casey is happy** because they have the item they want (I3 - jewelry).

Since Blake wants chocolates (I2), and they believe that I2 is in the bathroom (R21), Blake needs to move to the bathroom to pick up the chocolates. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(Blake, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the bathroom (R21) to get the chocolates.
2. **pick_up(Blake, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom (R21).
3. **put_down(Blake, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R22) to make it accessible for Alex.
4. **move(Alex, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R21) to check for items.
5. **pick_up(Alex, I2, R22)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the living room (R22).
6. **give(Alex, I2, Blake, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake in the living room (R22).

After these actions, Blake will have the chocolates they wanted, making them happy.
