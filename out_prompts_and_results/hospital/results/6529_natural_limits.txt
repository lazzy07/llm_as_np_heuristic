Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C, increasing their workload to 3. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room C, but due to the increased workload, mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Jones dies. Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, correctly identifying the disease as Flaze, and Young becomes healthy.
