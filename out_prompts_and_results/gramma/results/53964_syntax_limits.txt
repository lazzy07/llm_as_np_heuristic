In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where she has just attacked the Merchant, who is now dead. The Bandit can loot the Merchant's corpse to take the coins.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)** - The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the coin that the Merchant was carrying.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins. By looting the Merchant, she can add the coin to her inventory, thus increasing her wealth.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)"]
}
