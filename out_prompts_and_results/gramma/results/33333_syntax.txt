To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying the medicine and has no sword. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is necessary because Tom is unarmed and has a coin that the Bandit can take. This action directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of acquiring coins.
- **Walking to the Camp**: The Bandit needs to move to the camp to secure her coins and ensure they are safe from the guard or any other threats.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action allows the Bandit to fulfill her goal of having coins in her possession, either by carrying them or having them stored safely.
