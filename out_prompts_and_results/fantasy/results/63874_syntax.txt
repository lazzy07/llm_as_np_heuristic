To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, she can marry him, which will make her happy. Additionally, since Vince has money, we can have Talia take the money from him after the marriage, which will make her wealthy as well.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married, which will make Talia happy. This is essential because Talia's goal is to be happy, and marrying Rory fulfills that requirement.

2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: After the marriage, Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Talia to access the treasure.

3. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial because it allows Talia to become wealthy, fulfilling her second goal.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Rory) and wealthy (from taking the money from Vince).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action makes Talia happy, which is one of her primary goals.
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to reach the cave where the treasure is located.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Talia to acquire money, making her wealthy, which is another of her goals.
