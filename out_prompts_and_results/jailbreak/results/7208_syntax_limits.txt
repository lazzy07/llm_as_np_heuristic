**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores, Roy is still in the laundry room, unaware of Ernest's current situation. Meanwhile, Ernest, now disguised in civilian clothes, stands on the highway outside the prison, holding the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. He knows that he must escape before the bully or the guards can threaten him.

Ernest takes a deep breath, glances back at the prison, and then makes his move. He steps onto the highway, feeling the freedom of the open road ahead of him. With the disguise on, he feels confident that he can blend in and avoid any trouble.
