To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to a conclusion where the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, and the two characters making friends. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard are currently not fighting, and they are both in the cave. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, and the Lizard also desires friendship. This action will allow them to establish a positive relationship.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can acknowledge the danger outside. The volcano begins to erupt, which is a natural consequence of the story's setting.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is the final action that leads to the death of one of the characters. Since the surface is uninhabitable, and both characters are currently safe in the cave, we can assume that the eruption will affect the surface but not directly harm them in the cave.

4. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: To fulfill the requirement of a character dying, we can have the Lizard sacrifice itself to save Zoe from the eruption, thus dying in the process. This act of sacrifice can also symbolize the friendship they have just formed.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **make_peace**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual desire for companionship.
- **begin_erupt**: Initiates the volcanic eruption, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **erupt**: Causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the uninhabitable conditions on the surface.
- **kill**: The Lizard sacrifices itself, resulting in its death, while also solidifying the bond formed with Zoe.

The final outcome is that the Lizard dies, but they have made peace and become friends before this tragic event.
