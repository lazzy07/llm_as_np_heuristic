In this story, Vince's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, he needs to secure the treasure from the cave while ensuring he remains alive and well-fed. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Vince achieve his goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Vince travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for him to access the treasure, which will increase his wealth.

2. **Pickup the Treasure**: Once in the cave, Vince picks up the treasure. This action directly contributes to his goal of becoming wealthy.
