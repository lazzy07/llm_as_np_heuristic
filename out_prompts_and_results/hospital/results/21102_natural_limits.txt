Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats them with antibiotics. Young, however, has Jarkis and dies as a result. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, with a workload of 3, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Jones, however, has Jarkis and dies as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions. Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway, still with a workload of 3, mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross, too, has Jarkis and dies.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is not achieved due to the mistakes made from the high workload and the unknown symptoms of the patients.
