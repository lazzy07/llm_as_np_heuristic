In this story, Dr. Hathaway is in Patient Room B with Jones, who is also in the same room. Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. However, to ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones correctly.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is in Patient Room B, Hathaway can do this without moving. This action is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash), which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, Hathaway will administer antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, Hathaway will administer steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway can effectively reduce their workload and ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, thus achieving their goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
