**Story Completion:**

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (Ernest needs to get closer to the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that Ernest can confront him without the risk of being interrupted.)
3. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Ernest to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, allowing Ernest to feel safe and secure.)
5. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, making it easier for him to escape without being recognized.)
6. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This allows him to reach the highway without being detected.)
7. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (This fulfills his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to help Ernest eliminate the threat from the bully and ultimately escape the prison. Moving to the hallway and locking the gym door are strategic moves to ensure safety during the confrontation. Crawling through the vents allows for stealth, and killing the bully is a necessary action to remove the immediate danger. Putting on civilian clothes and escaping are the final steps to achieving Ernest's goal of being alive and free.
