To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any of the rooms, but Casey believes it is in the bathroom (R12). Therefore, we can have Blake tell Casey that they want the jewelry, prompting Casey to check the bathroom for it. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the jewelry, which Casey believes is in the bathroom. This action is necessary because it prompts Casey to check for the item that Blake wants.

2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to look for the jewelry. This action is necessary because Casey needs to check the location where they believe the jewelry is.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the bathroom. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room with the jewelry. This action is necessary to bring the jewelry back to Blake.

5. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R12)",
    "pick_up(C2, I2, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)",
    "give(C2, I2, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is designed to ensure that Blake ultimately receives the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and achieving happiness.
