To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story and keep Alex in the same room as the other characters.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room. This action is included to allow Blake to be in the same room as Alex, which is important for the social dynamics of the story.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey also moves to the dining room. This action is included to ensure that all characters are together, which can lead to further interactions.

6. **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Blake. This action is included to fulfill the requirement that Alex wants Blake to be happy, and it also allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy by giving away the item they wanted.

7. **give(C2, I3, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex. This action is included to ensure that Alex is happy with the flowers, which is a gesture of goodwill from Blake.

8. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake. This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy, as they want Blake to be happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, Blake will have the flowers, and Casey will have the chocolates, making all characters happy.
