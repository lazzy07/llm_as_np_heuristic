Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, armed and a known criminal. To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take action.

Tom uses his sword to attack the bandit, who is unarmed in this scenario. The bandit, unable to defend herself, is killed. Tom then loots the bandit's corpse, taking the bandit's coin. With the bandit defeated, Tom can now safely walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine.

This action sequence is necessary because:
1. Tom needs to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit to safely return to the cottage.
2. By looting the bandit, Tom gains a coin, which could be useful in future transactions, although it is not his primary goal.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

}
