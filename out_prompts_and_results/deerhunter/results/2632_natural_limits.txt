Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to go back to the bank. He believes the clerk has money, and he wants it for himself. 

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money he desires.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money he wanted, and Bambi is already dead, so the story concludes with Bubba achieving his goal.
