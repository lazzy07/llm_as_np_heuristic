Hawkins stands on the island, treasure in hand, while Silver approaches, eyeing the gleaming gold. Hawkins knows he must act quickly to secure his prize. 

1. **Hawkins takes the treasure.** - This action is necessary because Hawkins's goal is to possess the treasure, and he has already dug it up. 

2. **Hawkins sails back to the port.** - After taking the treasure, Hawkins needs to leave the island and return to the port to ensure he can keep the treasure safe and away from Silver.

3. **Hawkins hides the treasure.** - Once back at the port, Hawkins must find a secure place to hide the treasure, ensuring that Silver cannot find it.

In this sequence, Hawkins successfully achieves his goal of obtaining and securing the treasure without Silver being able to take it from him.
