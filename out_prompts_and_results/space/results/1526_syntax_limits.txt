Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are healthy but are in a dangerous situation due to the unstable environment of the surface. To ensure their safety and to foster friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

**Action:** Zoe teleports to the spaceship.

**Explanation:** By teleporting to the spaceship, Zoe ensures her safety from the dangerous conditions on the surface, which could worsen at any moment. This action also allows her to return to the surface later with a plan to invite the Lizard aboard her ship, fostering a friendship and ensuring both characters can be healthy and safe together.
