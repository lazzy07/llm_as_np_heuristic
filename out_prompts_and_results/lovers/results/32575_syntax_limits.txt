In the current situation, Blake (C3) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Blake needs to acquire the item I2. Since Casey (C2) is also unhappy and wants I2, Blake can help Casey by giving them the item they have (I1), which is currently with Alex (C1). 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **Trade**: Blake trades the item I1 (which they believe is with Casey) for the item I2 (which they believe is in the bathroom). This action allows Blake to acquire the item they want, making them happy.

**Explanation of the action**:
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they desire (I2) while also helping Casey, who wants I1. This mutual benefit aligns with Blake's goal of being happy and wanting Alex to be happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by acquiring the item they want through a trade with Casey.
