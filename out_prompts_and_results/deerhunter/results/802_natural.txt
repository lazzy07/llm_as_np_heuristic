Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk.

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to intimidate the clerk and demand money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the clerk's money, which is his goal.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any potential consequences.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.
- **Going to the forest**: This action allows Bubba to escape the bank after achieving his goal, ensuring he is not caught.
