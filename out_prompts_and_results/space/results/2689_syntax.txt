To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard take actions that lead to the volcano erupting, while also ensuring they become friends. The goal is to create a scenario where the volcano erupts, and one character dies, but they also manage to establish a friendship before that happens.

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** This action is necessary because it places Zoe in a location where the volcano can erupt, and it allows the story to progress towards the eruption.
   
2. **Lizard walks from the Cave to the Surface.** This action brings the Lizard to the same location as Zoe, which is essential for the next steps in the story.

3. **Zoe and Lizard make peace on the Surface.** This action establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends. 

4. **Begin erupting the volcano on the Surface.** This action initiates the eruption of the volcano, which is a critical plot point in the story.

5. **Erupt the volcano on the Surface.** This action completes the eruption process, leading to the death of one character.

6. **Zoe dies due to the eruption.** This is the final outcome of the story, where Zoe, despite having made peace with the Lizard, is caught in the eruption.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the tragic event.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "begin_erupt(Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively captures the necessary actions to achieve the story's conclusion while adhering to the constraints provided.
