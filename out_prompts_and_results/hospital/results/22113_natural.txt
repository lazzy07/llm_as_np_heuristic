**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment. 

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B and then walks with him to the room. 

In Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. However, since Hathaway's workload is now 2 (after treating Jones), he can still make an accurate assessment. He discovers that Ross has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young. He admits Young to Patient Room C and walks with him to the room. 

In Patient Room C, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing Unknown. With a workload of 2, Hathaway can accurately assess Young. He finds that Young has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
