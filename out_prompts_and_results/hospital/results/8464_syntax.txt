To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to confirm the symptoms. Since Young is already in Exam Room A and has a symptom (SymptomA), this action is necessary to determine the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. Since Young has SymptomA, Hathaway will treat them correctly, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Young will walk to the Admissions room to check on Jones and Ross, ensuring they are also alive and healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomA, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to confirm Young's symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but since Young's symptoms are already known, this action will help Hathaway confirm the diagnosis.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze (assuming SymptomA corresponds to Flaze). This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **walk(Young, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: After being treated, Young will walk to the Admissions room to check on the status of Jones and Ross, ensuring they are also alive and healthy.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomA, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Young, PatientRoomA, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy while also allowing for the possibility of checking on the other patients.
