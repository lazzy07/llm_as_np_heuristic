To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba is at the bank and wants money, he will attempt to steal from the bank clerk. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to do this.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

After these actions, the story will conclude with Bubba having the money, which satisfies the requirement.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because Bubba wants money and has the means (a loaded rifle) to take it from the clerk.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba obtaining the money he desires, fulfilling the story's goal.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money while also adhering to the constraints of the story. Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba having money is met.
