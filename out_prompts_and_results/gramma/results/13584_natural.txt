To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the market where the merchant is located, as he needs to obtain the medicine.

2. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, Tom helps the guard to focus on capturing the bandit, which may create a distraction or a safer environment for him to interact with the merchant.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard moves to the crossroads to deal with the bandit, leaving the market temporarily. This action is necessary to ensure that the market is less dangerous for Tom.

4. **Tom buys the medicine from the merchant by giving her the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires, fulfilling part of his goal.

5. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom walks back to the cottage, now carrying the medicine, which completes his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is chosen to ensure that Tom can safely obtain the medicine and return to the cottage. Reporting the bandit to the guard helps to mitigate the risk of encountering the bandit while Tom is at the market. The sequence of actions is designed to minimize conflict and ensure Tom's success.
