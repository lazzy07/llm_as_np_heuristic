To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that I1 is with Casey (C3). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) trades the item they have (which is the jewelry I1) with Casey (C3) for the item Casey has (which is the chocolates I2) in the living room (R21).

This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, thus making them happy. 

After this trade, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I2), which they want, making them happy as well.

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I1, C3, I2, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
