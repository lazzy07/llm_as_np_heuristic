**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is showing symptoms of Fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she prioritizes treating Ross to ensure he becomes healthy.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Ross is experiencing Fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. By treating him correctly, Hathaway can help him become healthy.

After treating Ross, Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address the situation with Young, who is still in Admissions and has unknown symptoms. Since Jones is also in Admissions, Hathaway decides to admit Young to an exam room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assessed and treated, as he is also a patient who wants to be healthy.

Now, Hathaway can assess Young's condition.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine what symptoms Young is experiencing so that he can be treated appropriately.

Assuming Young shows symptoms of Fever (which is a possibility given the context), Hathaway would then treat him for Flaze as well.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** This action is necessary to ensure that Young becomes healthy, just like Ross.

At this point, both Ross and Young are healthy, and Hathaway has successfully treated her patients.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Ross for Flaze is essential to ensure he recovers from his Fever.
- Admitting Young to an exam room is necessary to facilitate his assessment and treatment.
- Assessing Young allows Hathaway to identify his symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
- Treating Young for Flaze ensures that he also becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
