To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to an exam room to assess his condition. This increases Hathaway's workload to 1, which is still manageable.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Young to another exam room. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that Ross has Jarkis.

4. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B with Steroids**: Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload back to 1.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. Young has SymptomB, which Hathaway will correctly identify as Flaze.

6. **Treat Young in Exam Room C with Antibiotics**: Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Young healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload back to 0.

7. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will assume he has Flaze (as a precaution) and treat him accordingly.

8. **Treat Jones in Exam Room A with Antibiotics**: Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics. If Jones has Flaze, he will become healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway ensures that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
