In this story, Zoe is currently on her spaceship, while the Lizard is on the surface of the planet. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve this, Zoe will teleport from the spaceship to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to interact with the Lizard directly, which is essential for building a friendship. However, since the surface is dangerous due to the volcano, Zoe must act quickly.

1. **Action: teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard. This is necessary for her to engage with the Lizard and attempt to make peace.

After Zoe teleports to the surface, she finds the Lizard. The volcano is still erupting, and the situation is tense. However, Zoe approaches the Lizard with a friendly demeanor, hoping to establish a connection.

2. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard. 

The Lizard, seeing Zoe's intentions and recognizing the danger of the erupting volcano, agrees to be friends. They both realize that they need to work together to ensure their safety.

3. **Action: erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

As the volcano erupts, the Lizard, now a friend to Zoe, helps her escape to safety. However, the eruption is too powerful, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise. 

In summary, the actions taken were necessary to achieve the goals of both characters while also fulfilling the story's ending conditions.
