**Story Completion:**

In the bank, the villain devises a plan to control the President. The villain approaches the President and threatens him, asserting that if he does not comply with the villain's demands, there will be severe consequences. The President, feeling intimidated and fearing for his position, reluctantly agrees to the villain's terms.

Next, the villain uses the money in the bank to bribe the President, offering him a substantial amount to ensure his loyalty. The President, now under the influence of the villain's threat and the bribe, becomes compliant and begins to act in the villain's favor.

With the President now under the villain's control, the villain has successfully achieved his goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Threaten the President**: The villain threatens the President to instill fear, making the President more susceptible to manipulation. This action is crucial as it creates a power dynamic where the President feels he must comply with the villain's demands.

2. **Bribe the President**: After instilling fear, the villain offers money to the President as a bribe. This solidifies the control over the President, as he now has a financial incentive to act in the villain's interest. The combination of fear and financial gain ensures the villain's dominance.
