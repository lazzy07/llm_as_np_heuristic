Tom is at the Crossroads, armed with a sword and determined to get to the cottage carrying the medicine. The merchant is also at the Crossroads, and she has the medicine. The bandit, who is a criminal, is also present at the Crossroads and poses a threat to Tom's goal.

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to attack the bandit. This action is necessary because the bandit is a criminal who could potentially steal the medicine or coins from Tom. By attacking the bandit, Tom can eliminate the threat and secure the medicine.

After successfully attacking the bandit, Tom loots the medicine from the bandit's corpse. This action allows Tom to finally carry the medicine he desires.

Now, with the medicine in hand, Tom can walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **attack(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)** - Tom attacks the bandit to eliminate the threat.
2. **loot(Tom, Medicine, Bandit, Crossroads)** - Tom loots the medicine from the bandit’s corpse.
3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)** - Tom walks to the cottage carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
