**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is alive and in the room, Hathaway can assess him. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Next, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

Now, with Jones healthy, Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also alive but has unknown symptoms. After the assessment, Hathaway finds that Ross has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis.

Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy as well.

Finally, Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room C. Hathaway assesses Young, who is alive and has unknown symptoms. After the assessment, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating he also has Jarkis.
