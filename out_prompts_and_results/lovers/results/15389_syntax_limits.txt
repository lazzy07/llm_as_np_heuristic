In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and it is located in the same room (R22) where Alex is currently located. Since Alex is already in the room with the jewelry, the simplest action to achieve their goal is for Alex to pick up the jewelry.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of the Action:
