To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the jewelry. This action is important because it communicates Alex's desire and sets the stage for Casey to understand what Alex needs.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R12) to the dining room (R22) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to access the jewelry that Alex wants.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room (R22). This action is crucial as it allows Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the bathroom (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
