The bandit, armed with her sword and carrying the medicine, decides to take action to secure her goal of having as many coins as possible. She knows that the guard is at the market and the hero is at the crossroads, so she takes a calculated risk.

**Action:** The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.

**Explanation:** By walking to the bandit camp, the bandit can safely store the medicine and any coins she has in the chest there. This action allows her to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp without any immediate threat from the guard or the hero.
