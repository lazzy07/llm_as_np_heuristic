2. **The Lizard agrees to make peace with Zoe.** This action is essential as it solidifies their friendship and allows them to collaborate in the face of the erupting volcano.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to leave the cave and teleport to the spaceship together.** This action is crucial because the cave is not a safe long-term location, and they need to escape the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface. Teleporting to the spaceship ensures their safety.
