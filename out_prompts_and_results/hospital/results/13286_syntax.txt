To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 2, they can assess Ross, who is already in PatientRoomA. However, Ross has already been assessed, so Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is in Admissions. This will help determine Young's symptoms.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will need to admit Young to an exam room. Since Jones is already in PatientRoomC, and Ross is in PatientRoomA, the only available room for Young is PatientRoomB.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway will then walk back to Admissions to assess Jones, who is currently there.

4. **Assess Jones**: After reaching Admissions, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

5. **Treat Ross**: Since Ross has already been assessed and has SymptomA, Hathaway can treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for Flaze (antibiotics).

6. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms assessed earlier.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms assessed earlier.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly, leading to their health.
