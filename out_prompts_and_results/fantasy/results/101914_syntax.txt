To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her goals and the available actions. Since Talia is already married to Rory, her happiness is secured through their relationship. However, she currently has no wealth. The quickest way for Talia to become wealthy is for her to acquire the treasure located in the cave.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave (Talia)**: Talia needs to go to the cave where the treasure is located.
2. **Pickup Treasure (Talia)**: Once Talia is in the cave, she can pick up the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to reach the location of the treasure. Without traveling to the cave, she cannot access the treasure.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which directly contributes to her wealth. Since Talia's goal is to be wealthy, this action is essential.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Talia, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia becomes wealthy, achieving one of her primary goals.
