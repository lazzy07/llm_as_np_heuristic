In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. After eating Vince and Talia, Gargax is still hungry and has not yet acquired any treasure. Rory, who is alive and has the money, is the only character left in the village. Gargax can achieve his goal by eating Rory, which will not only satisfy his hunger but also allow him to take the money Rory possesses.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax eats Rory, which satisfies his hunger and allows him to take the money Rory has.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Gargax's goal of not being hungry. By eating Rory, Gargax also indirectly gains wealth since Rory had the money.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for Gargax to achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
