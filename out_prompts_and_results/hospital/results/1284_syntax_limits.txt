**Story Completion:**

After admitting Young to Exam Room B, Hathaway assesses Young's symptoms. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway checks Young's symptoms to determine the appropriate treatment. Since Young has a rash (SymptomB), Hathaway identifies that Young has Jarkis.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This successfully makes Young healthy.

Young is now healthy and has achieved their goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Young's condition. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot determine the correct treatment.
- The second action is crucial as it provides the necessary treatment for Young's condition, ensuring Young's health and survival.
