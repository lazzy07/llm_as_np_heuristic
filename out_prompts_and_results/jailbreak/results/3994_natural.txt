**Story Completion:**

Day one continues with Roy in the laundry room, holding the knife. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is in the cells, threatened by the bully. To protect both himself and Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him without interference.)
3. **Roy enters the gym and confronts the bully.** (This is the moment of confrontation where Roy can take control of the situation.)
4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to the cells to inform Ernest of the situation and ensure their safety.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the hallway is essential for Roy to reach the gym where the bully is.
- Locking the gym door secures the area, preventing the bully from escaping and allowing Roy to confront him without fear of retaliation.
- Confronting the bully is necessary to resolve the threat that he poses to both Roy and Ernest.
- Killing the bully is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened, allowing them to live without fear.
