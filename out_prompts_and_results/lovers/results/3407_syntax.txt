To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy, as Alex wants Casey to be happy.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want.

6. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R21). This action ensures that Blake has the item they want.

7. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey.

8. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R22). This ensures that Casey is happy as well.
