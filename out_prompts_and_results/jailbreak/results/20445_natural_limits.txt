**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, feels a surge of hope. He knows that Ernest is still in the laundry room, threatened by the bully. Roy decides to take a risk. He sneaks back through the vent to the hallway, where he can lock the gym door, trapping the bully inside. 

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door, ensuring the bully cannot escape. With the bully contained, Roy feels a sense of relief. He knows that Ernest is safe for now, and he can make his escape without the bully's threat looming over them.
