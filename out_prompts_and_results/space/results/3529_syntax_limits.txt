Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the ground tremble beneath her as the volcano begins to erupt. She knows she needs to act quickly to ensure both her safety and that of the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Despite the danger, she has been working to build a friendship with the Lizard, and she believes they can help each other.

To solidify their bond and ensure they both remain safe, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard. This action will not only strengthen their relationship but also create a sense of unity in the face of the impending eruption.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of being healthy and safe while fostering a connection with another creature. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the eruption and ensure their survival.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can then decide to teleport to the spaceship together, ensuring their safety from the eruption.
