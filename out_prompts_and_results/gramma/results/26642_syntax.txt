To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coins she is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count without needing to go back to the camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. The Bandit robs the Merchant at the Crossroads, taking the coins she is carrying. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's wealth and helps her achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

2. After successfully robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to store her newly acquired coins in the chest, ensuring they are safe and fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal through these actions.
