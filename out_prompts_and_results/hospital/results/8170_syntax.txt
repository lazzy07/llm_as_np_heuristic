To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to treat the patients directly based on their assigned rooms without assessing them first. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Hathaway walks to Exam Room A**: This is necessary to treat Young, who is assigned to Exam Room A.
2. **Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics**: Since Young is the only patient in Exam Room A, and antibiotics are the correct treatment for Flaze (which Young is assumed to have), this action will make Young healthy.
3. **Hathaway walks to Exam Room B**: This is necessary to treat Ross, who is assigned to Exam Room B.
4. **Hathaway treats Ross with steroids**: Since Ross is the only patient in Exam Room B, and steroids are the correct treatment for Jarkis (which Ross is assumed to have), this action will make Ross healthy.
5. **Hathaway walks to Exam Room C**: This is necessary to treat Jones, who is assigned to Exam Room C.
6. **Hathaway treats Jones with steroids**: Since Jones is the only patient in Exam Room C, and steroids are the correct treatment for Jarkis (which Jones is assumed to have), this action will make Jones healthy.

By treating each patient with the correct treatment based on their assigned rooms, Hathaway ensures that all patients become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to Exam Room A**: Necessary to reach Young for treatment.
- **Treating Young with antibiotics**: Assumed to have Flaze, so this treatment is correct.
- **Walking to Exam Room B**: Necessary to reach Ross for treatment.
- **Treating Ross with steroids**: Assumed to have Jarkis, so this treatment is correct.
- **Walking to Exam Room C**: Necessary to reach Jones for treatment.
- **Treating Jones with steroids**: Assumed to have Jarkis, so this treatment is correct.
