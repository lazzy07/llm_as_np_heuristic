To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** 

This action is necessary because Rory needs to return to the cave where the treasure is located. By traveling to the cave, Rory can ensure that he has access to the treasure, which will increase his wealth. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he will also be happy as a result of their marriage. 

After this action, Rory will have the treasure, which will make him wealthy, and he will remain happy due to his marriage to Talia. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Rory travels from the village to the cave."]
}
``` 

This single action is sufficient for Rory to achieve his goals of happiness and wealth, while also ensuring he is not hungry, as he is not in a situation where he needs to eat.
