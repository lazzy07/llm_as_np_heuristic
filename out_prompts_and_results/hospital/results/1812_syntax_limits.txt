In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. Since Ross has already been assigned to this room, Hathaway can directly assess him. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has SymptomA (which we assume corresponds to Flaze), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated in the future, contributing to the overall goal of making all patients healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment.
- **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics after confirming he has Flaze. This ensures Ross becomes healthy.
- **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C, preparing for his assessment and treatment later, ensuring he will also have a chance to become healthy.

By taking these actions, Hathaway successfully works towards the goal of having all patients healthy.
