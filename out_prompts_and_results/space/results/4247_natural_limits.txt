Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the heat of the volcano rumbling beneath her feet. The Lizard, the guardian of the surface, approaches her cautiously. Both are aware of the danger surrounding them, but neither has made any aggressive moves. 

Zoe, wanting to make friends, takes a step forward and extends her hand in a gesture of peace. The Lizard, sensing her intention, responds by lowering its head and making a soft, welcoming sound. They both realize that they share a common goal: to be healthy and safe.
