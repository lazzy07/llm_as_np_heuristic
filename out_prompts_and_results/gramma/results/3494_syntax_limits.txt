In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market, where she has just attacked the Merchant and looted the Medicine. Tom, who is also at the Market, has been robbed of his coin by the Bandit. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since she has already robbed Tom, she now has one of his coins.

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp and place the coin she has in the chest there. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

This is the only action needed to complete the story, as it directly leads to the Bandit achieving her goal.
