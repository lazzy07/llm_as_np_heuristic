To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive and does not have any money. The clerk has the money but is not in the forest, so Bubba cannot steal from the clerk directly. However, Bubba can use the rifle to shoot Bambi, which would allow him to eat and potentially fulfill his hunger.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi without any obstacles.
   
2. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the dead animal, which satisfies his hunger. This action is important as it shows Bubba taking advantage of the situation after killing Bambi.

3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba can move to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and potentially steal the money.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - With the rifle still in hand, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Shoot Bambi:** This is the first and crucial action that leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the required outcomes.
