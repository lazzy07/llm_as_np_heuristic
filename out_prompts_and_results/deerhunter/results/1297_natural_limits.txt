Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money. He goes back to the forest where Bambi is. Seeing Bambi, he loads the ammunition into the rifle, preparing to shoot. Bubba then shoots Bambi, killing her. With Bambi dead, Bubba can now eat her, satisfying his hunger, and he can also take the money he desires.
