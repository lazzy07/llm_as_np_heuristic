To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain social connections.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to check on Alex. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but shows Blake's concern for Alex.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey also moves to the dining room to see what's happening. This action is similar to Blake's and helps maintain the social dynamic.

6. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is crucial because it ensures that Casey is happy, which is also a goal for Alex.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, and they have also made Casey happy by giving them the flowers.
