In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Market with the Medicine, and the Bandit is also at the Market, armed and likely to cause trouble.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Market to the Crossroads to meet Tom, who is looking for the Medicine. This action is necessary for the Merchant to sell the Medicine and gain a coin.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: Tom buys the Medicine from the Merchant using one of his coins. This action allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring a coin without engaging in any criminal activity.

The Merchant successfully sells the Medicine to Tom, thus achieving her goal of obtaining a coin.
