To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation without being harmed by the armed characters. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine.

The story is straightforward because Tom already has the medicine and is not in immediate danger from the other characters. The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) are either at the market or the bandit camp, and they do not pose a threat to Tom as he moves to the cottage.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to move directly to his goal location, the cottage, where he can safely carry the medicine without interference from the other characters.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:

{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
