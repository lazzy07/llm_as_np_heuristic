To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, who has proposed to her. Since Talia is currently in the Cave and Vince is in the Village with the Money, the best course of action is for Talia to accept Vince's proposal, which will make them both happy. After that, Talia can travel to the Village to pick up the Money, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling one of her primary goals.

2. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures that Talia is happy.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels to the Village where Vince is located. This is necessary for her to access the Money that Vince has.

4. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the Money from Vince. This action will make Talia wealthy, fulfilling her second goal.

Now, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage to Vince) and wealthy (after picking up the Money).
