Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and is unaware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. She decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure they can work together for their mutual safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, explaining the danger of the volcano. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to establish a friendship.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship to gather supplies and a plan to help the Lizard. This action is necessary for Zoe to prepare for the next steps in ensuring both their safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now aware of Zoe's intentions and the danger, walks towards the cave to meet Zoe. This action is important as it brings the Lizard to Zoe, allowing them to collaborate.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe is preparing in her ship, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is critical as it sets the stage for the climax of the story.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts fully, causing destruction on the surface. This action results in the death of the Lizard, who is unable to escape in time. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also highlighting the urgency of their earlier actions.

In summary, the story illustrates the importance of friendship and collaboration in the face of danger, but ultimately, the Lizard's fate is sealed by the eruption.
