To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the jewelry. This is a straightforward way for Alex to express their desire and potentially influence Casey's actions.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R12) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to retrieve the jewelry for Alex.

4. **pick_up(C3, I1, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the bedroom. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) with the jewelry. This allows Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire and makes them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
