In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want item I3 (which is currently in the same room as Alex). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the item they want, making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will still be happy because they have I1.
- Casey will now be happy because they have received I3.
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy and for Casey to be happy, this action fulfills Alex's goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) is crucial because it directly satisfies Casey's desire, thus achieving the goal of making both Alex and Casey happy.
