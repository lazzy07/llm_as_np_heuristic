To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the living room (R21) and the flowers are with Casey (C3) in the bedroom (C3). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Action: move(C1, R21, R12)** - Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This action is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and obtain the flowers.

2. **Action: give(C3, I1, C1, R12)** - Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to receive the item they want, thus making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This action is essential as it directly results in Alex receiving the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
