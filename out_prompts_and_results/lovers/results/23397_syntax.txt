To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) as well. This action allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating a potential trade or exchange of items.

3. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the flowers (I1) with Casey for the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to give the item that Alex wants to Blake, who can then give it to Alex.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) with the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex to give the flowers.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action is the final step that ensures Alex has the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
