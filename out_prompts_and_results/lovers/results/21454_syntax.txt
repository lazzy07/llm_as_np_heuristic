To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially trade or give items.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Blake to potentially interact with Alex later.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey also moves back to the bedroom (R12). Similar to Blake's action, this keeps the characters in motion and allows for future interactions.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey and Blake to interact with them.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is what they want.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake's movement is not essential for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey's movement also serves to keep the narrative progressing.
