Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit, who is also armed, and realizes that he needs to get to the cottage safely with the medicine. 

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. This action is crucial because it will alert the guard to the presence of a criminal, allowing the guard to take action against the bandit. 

Tom walks to the market to report the bandit. Once he reaches the market, he informs the guard about the bandit at the crossroads. The guard, upon receiving this information, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit. 

With the bandit distracted by the guard, Tom takes the opportunity to walk back to the cottage, successfully carrying the medicine with him. 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine while also ensuring the bandit is dealt with by the guard.
