To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax, who is at the cave, wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax will gain the money that Vince has, which is essential for Gargax's goal. 

2. **Gargax takes the treasure**: After eating Vince, Gargax can now take the treasure that is at the cave. This action will further increase Gargax's wealth.

3. **Vince is dead**: After Gargax eats Vince, Vince is no longer alive, which means he cannot achieve his goals anymore. However, since Gargax has achieved his goal of wealth, the story can conclude here.
