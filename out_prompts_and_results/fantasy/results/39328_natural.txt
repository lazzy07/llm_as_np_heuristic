To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the village, and Rory is at the cave. The treasure is at the cave, and Talia has no money or treasure. 

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Rory needs to acquire the treasure, which is essential for Talia's happiness and wealth.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to Talia with the treasure to make her happy and wealthy.

3. **Rory gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

4. **Talia becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure now in her possession, Talia achieves her goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave:** This is necessary for Talia to become wealthy.
- **Rory travels from the cave to the village:** Rory needs to return to Talia to give her the treasure.
- **Rory gives the treasure to Talia:** This action fulfills Talia's desire for wealth, leading to her happiness.
- **Talia becomes happy:** This is the ultimate goal for Talia, which is achieved through the previous actions.
