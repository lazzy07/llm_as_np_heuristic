2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze. If Young has a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, ensuring they are also treated properly.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Admissions to determine their symptoms. This is important to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Jones also becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Admissions to determine their symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.
