To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure from the cave. Since Gargax has already eaten both Vince and Talia, and Vince has the money, Gargax will need to take the money from Vince's body and then travel to the cave to collect the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. Gargax takes the money from Vince's body. (This action is necessary for Gargax to become wealthy, as Vince has the money.)
2. Gargax travels from the village to the cave. (This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location of the treasure.)
3. Gargax picks up the treasure at the cave. (This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve wealth by obtaining the treasure.)

After these actions, Gargax will have both the money and the treasure, fulfilling their goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Take the money from Vince's body**: This is essential for Gargax to gain wealth since Gargax's wealth is currently 0, and Vince has the only money available.
- **Travel from the village to the cave**: Gargax needs to reach the cave to access the treasure, which is crucial for achieving wealth.
- **Pick up the treasure at the cave**: This final action allows Gargax to complete their goal of becoming wealthy.
