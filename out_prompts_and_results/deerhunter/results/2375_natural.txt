To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his desire to have money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going from the forest to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to interact with him and take the money.
- **Stealing the money** is the direct action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully intimidate the clerk into allowing him to take the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will still be confirmed dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
