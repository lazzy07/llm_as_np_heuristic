In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the item in the dining room (I2), which is flowers. However, they have the jewelry (I1) that they received from Casey (C3). To achieve their goal of making Alex (C1) happy, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

To complete the story, Blake can trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex for the flowers (I2) that Alex wants. This will make both Blake and Alex happy, as they will have the items they desire.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they have for the flowers (I2) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it allows both characters to achieve their happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they have the flowers (I2).
- Blake (C2) will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the chocolates (I3).

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.
