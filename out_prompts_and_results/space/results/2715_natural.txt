Zoe and the Lizard are currently at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary to transition from being enemies to friends. Since they are not fighting, they can establish a friendship, which aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

2. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting. Since the surface is already dangerous, the eruption will lead to a character dying, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.

3. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety from the eruption. Since the surface is uninhabitable and dangerous, Zoe must escape to survive.

4. **The Lizard remains on the surface.** The Lizard, having made peace with Zoe, chooses to stay on the surface, which leads to its demise when the volcano erupts.

The final sequence of actions ensures that Zoe and the Lizard become friends while also resulting in the Lizard's death due to the eruption. 

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **Making peace** allows Zoe and the Lizard to align their goals and establish a friendship, which is essential for both characters.
- **The eruption** serves as a natural consequence of the setting, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
- **Zoe teleporting to the spaceship** ensures her survival, as she prioritizes her health and safety.
- **The Lizard remaining on the surface** leads to its death, completing the story's requirements.
