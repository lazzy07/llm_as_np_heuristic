To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the same location as the bandit, allowing her to interact with the bandit and potentially negotiate or retrieve her sword.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant of her sword.**  
   - The bandit, being armed, can rob the merchant who is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to gain another weapon, but it also puts the merchant in a position where she needs to act quickly to regain her advantage.

3. **The merchant reports the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant can call for help from the guard, who is at the market. This action is crucial as it brings the guard into the situation, allowing for a confrontation with the bandit.

4. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to arrive at the crossroads to confront the bandit. This action is essential for the guard to fulfill his goal of dealing with criminals.

5. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - The guard, being armed and now at the crossroads, can attack the bandit. This action eliminates the bandit as a threat and allows the merchant to reclaim her items.

6. **The merchant loots the bandit's corpse.**  
   - After the bandit is dead, the merchant can loot her corpse to retrieve the coins that the bandit has. This action directly contributes to the merchant's goal of acquiring coins.

7. **The merchant walks back to the camp.**  
   - Finally, the merchant returns to the camp with the coins she has acquired, ensuring her safety and allowing her to keep the coins without becoming a criminal.

This sequence of actions ensures that the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins while navigating the threats posed by the bandit and the guard.
