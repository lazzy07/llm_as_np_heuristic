**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realizes that he must act quickly to protect himself and Ernest. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs to get it to defend himself. 

Roy decides to use the situation to his advantage. He waits for the bully to let his guard down, then he quickly unlocks the gym door, sneaks out into the hallway, and crawls through the vents to reach the kitchen. 

Once in the kitchen, he retrieves the knife. With the knife in hand, he returns to the gym, locking the door behind him to prevent the bully from escaping.
