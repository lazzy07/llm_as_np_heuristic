Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and is in danger due to the erupting volcano. She decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure their safety and to foster a friendship. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe initiates a conversation with the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it helps to build a relationship between them, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the surface to help the Lizard. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters are together and can face the danger of the volcano erupting.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface, the volcano erupts. This action fulfills the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting and a character dying, as the eruption is dangerous and will lead to the demise of one of the characters.

In this story, Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard, ensuring they are no longer enemies, and they face the eruption together. However, the eruption ultimately leads to the death of one character, fulfilling the story's requirements.
