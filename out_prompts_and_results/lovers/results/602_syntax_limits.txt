In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the flowers (I1). Currently, Alex is in the living room (R22), while Casey and Blake are in the dining room (R12). Blake has the flowers (I1) with them. 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action is taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the flowers (I1) that Blake (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.
