Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway confirms that he has a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway believes that admitting him to an exam room is necessary to ensure he receives proper care.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine the disease at this moment, but he has ensured that Young is in a room where he can be treated as soon as his symptoms are known.
