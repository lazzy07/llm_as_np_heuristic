To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank with some money, and Bambi is also in the forest.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary because the clerk has the money that Bubba desires.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money without any resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is the final step in achieving his goal of obtaining money.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Although Bubba is hungry, he has already decided to eat, but he does not need to take any further action regarding food since his primary goal is to obtain money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to reach the bank to confront the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the threat and secures the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money, achieving his goal.
