Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make a connection with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to initiate a conversation and establish a relationship with the Lizard, as they are currently not fighting and can communicate.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and be safe. 

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since both characters are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

4. **Zoe teleports to the ship.** - Zoe teleports to the ship to ensure her safety from the eruption, leaving the Lizard behind.

5. **The Lizard is caught in the eruption and dies.** - The Lizard, having not teleported away, is unable to escape the eruption, resulting in its death.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and the establishment of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the eruption occurs.
