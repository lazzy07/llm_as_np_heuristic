Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's need for safety, follows her to the spaceship, as they have become friends and want to support each other. Once aboard the spaceship, they can both be safe and healthy together.

2. **The Lizard teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to ensure both of them are safe, reinforcing their friendship.
