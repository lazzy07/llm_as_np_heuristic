Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and since he has the knife, he can confront the bully without being threatened in the cell block. 

Ernest takes the following action:

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** - This action allows Ernest to bypass the locked door and confront the bully directly without being threatened.

2. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** - By eliminating the bully, Ernest ensures that both he and Roy are no longer threatened, allowing them to live peacefully in the prison.

With the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on getting a pack of cigarettes from Roy, who has stolen them earlier. 

This story is short and direct, focusing on Ernest's immediate goal of ensuring his safety and that of his friend Roy.
