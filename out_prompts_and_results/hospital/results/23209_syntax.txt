To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to assess the patients in exam room A and treat them accordingly. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Young as well. This will help in determining Young's condition and ensure that both patients in exam room A are evaluated.

3. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA**: Once Hathaway has assessed Jones and identified his symptoms, they can treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomA**: After treating Jones, Hathaway should treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that both patients in exam room A are treated and become healthy.
