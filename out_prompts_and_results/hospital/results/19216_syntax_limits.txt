In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Jones, who is already assigned to PatientRoomA and has a known symptom (SymptomA). Hathaway needs to treat Jones to achieve their goal. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently unassigned and has an unknown symptom. This action is necessary to determine if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, as both diseases exist and need to be addressed.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway admits him to Exam Room B. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to treat Ross based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This action is essential to ensure that Ross becomes healthy, contributing to Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can effectively manage the patients and ensure their health.
