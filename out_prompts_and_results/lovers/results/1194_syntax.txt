To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to interact with them.

2. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers. This is essential as Casey needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the flowers to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Casey puts down the chocolates in the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story consistent with the items in play.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the flowers they wanted.
