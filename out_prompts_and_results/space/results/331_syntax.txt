To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact and potentially make friends.

2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important as it allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, facilitating a potential friendship.

3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

4. **Walk from Cave to Surface**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the surface. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but helps to ensure that both characters are in a safe location together.

5. **Begin Erupt (Surface)**: Zoe initiates the eruption of the volcano, which is a strategic move to demonstrate the danger of the surface and the need for cooperation between her and the Lizard.

6. **Erupt (Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation that requires both Zoe and the Lizard to work together for survival. This action reinforces the bond between them as they must rely on each other.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
