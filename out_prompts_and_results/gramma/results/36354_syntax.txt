To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coins she has. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and the Merchant is unarmed and vulnerable in the Market.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, which is part of her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the coins are safely stored, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This is the first and crucial step for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. The Merchant is unarmed, making her an easy target.
- **Walking to the Camp**: After acquiring the coins, the Bandit needs to move to a secure location (the Bandit Camp) to ensure her safety and the safety of the coins.
- **Taking the Coins to the Chest**: This final action secures the coins in the chest, which is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins stored safely.
