To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince, who is currently in the Village. This action is necessary because Talia wants to be wealthy, and since Vince has the money, taking it from him will fulfill her goal of wealth. 

After this action, Talia will have money, which contributes to her wealth, and since she is already in a relationship with Rory (who she has accepted a proposal from), she will also be happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the money she desires, thus achieving her goal of wealth. Since she is already in a relationship with Rory, this action also indirectly contributes to her happiness.
