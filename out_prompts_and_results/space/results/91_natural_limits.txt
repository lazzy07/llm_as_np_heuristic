Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who is still on the surface and feels threatened by Zoe's presence. The Lizard, wanting to protect its territory, decides to walk to the cave to confront Zoe. 

Once at the cave, the Lizard and Zoe find themselves face to face. Initially, they are wary of each other, but as they talk, they begin to understand that they both want the same things: health, safety, and friendship. They decide to make peace instead of fighting, realizing that cooperation is better than conflict.

However, while they are making peace, the volcano on the surface erupts violently. The Lizard, still on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies, while Zoe remains safe in the cave.
