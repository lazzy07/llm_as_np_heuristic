In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the flowers (I3). Blake (C2) has the chocolates (I2) but is not happy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Blake to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) is still not happy because they still have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the flowers (I3).

This action is necessary and sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["give(C2, I1, C1, R21)"]
