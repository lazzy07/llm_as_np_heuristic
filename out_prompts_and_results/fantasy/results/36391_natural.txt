To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but her happiness and wealth are both at zero. The treasure is at the cave, and Vince has the money. Gargax, the dragon, is also present in the cave and is motivated by wealth.

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince has, which is 1 unit. This action will also remove Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her happiness and wealth without the complication of two husbands.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the treasure that is at the cave. This action fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth.

3. **Talia proposes to Rory**: Talia, now without Vince, can propose to Rory. Since they are already married, this action is more of a reaffirmation of their bond, which can help boost Talia's happiness.

4. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: Rory accepts Talia's proposal, which makes both of them happy.

5. **Talia's happiness increases**: With the proposal and acceptance, Talia's happiness increases, fulfilling her goal of becoming happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action removes Vince from the story and allows Gargax to take the money, which he desires.
- **Gargax takes the treasure**: This fulfills Gargax's goal of wealth.
- **Talia proposes to Rory**: This action is aimed at increasing Talia's happiness.
- **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: This solidifies their relationship and increases Talia's happiness.

At the end of these actions, Talia becomes happy, achieving her goal.
