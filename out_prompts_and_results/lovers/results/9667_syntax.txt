To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey (C2) is currently in the dining room (R12) and needs to move to the living room (R22) where Alex (C1) is located. This action is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Once in the living room, Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C3). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to receive the item they want, which is the jewelry.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R12) after giving the jewelry to Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story.

4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to check on Casey and Blake. This action is also not necessary for Casey's happiness but adds to the narrative.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to be with Blake and Alex. This action is important for Casey to be with the other characters after receiving the jewelry.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
