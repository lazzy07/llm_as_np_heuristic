Ernest, aware of the bully's threat, decides to take a bold step to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He sneaks through the vent from the laundry room to the gym, where the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, he confronts the bully and, with the knife he stole earlier, he kills the bully. This action eliminates the threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to live without fear.

After killing the bully, Ernest can now safely return to the laundry room, where he can wait for Roy to finish his chores. With the bully out of the way, they can plan their escape together the next day.

2. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This is the critical action that ensures both Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to live safely.
