To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba is now leaving the bank with the stolen money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk is the only character with money.
- **Steal the money:** This action is executed because Bubba has a loaded rifle, which gives him the power to take the money from the clerk.
- **Go to the house:** This action is included to signify that Bubba is leaving the bank after successfully stealing the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
