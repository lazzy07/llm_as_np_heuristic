**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Roy, who is currently in the hallway, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym and is a threat to them both. 

1. **Roy locks the gym door.** This action prevents the bully from leaving the gym and ensures that he cannot threaten either Roy or Ernest while they are vulnerable. 

2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** This disguises him, allowing him to move more freely without being recognized as a prisoner. 

3. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** This action allows him to escape the prison without being detected by the guards or the bully. 

4. **Roy escapes from the prison.** With the disguise on and having successfully navigated through the vents, Roy is now free and has achieved his goal of being alive and not threatened.
