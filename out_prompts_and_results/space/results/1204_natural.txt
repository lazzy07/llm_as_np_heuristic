Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are enemies. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to transition from being enemies to friends, which is one of their goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other better.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs naturally in the story and serves to create a sense of urgency. The eruption will lead to a character dying, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.

3. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** This action is taken to place Zoe in the dangerous environment of the surface where the volcano is erupting. Since the surface is dangerous, this action will lead to Zoe's demise.

4. **The Lizard remains in the cave.** The Lizard stays safe in the cave, avoiding the eruption and ensuring its survival.

The final outcome is that Zoe dies due to the eruption while the Lizard remains safe in the cave. However, before Zoe's demise, they have made peace, establishing a friendship that transcends their previous enmity.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Zoe makes peace with the Lizard",
    "The volcano erupts",
    "Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired ending while adhering to the constraints of the story.
