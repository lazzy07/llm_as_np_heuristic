In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, we need to be cautious about the actions taken to avoid mistakes in diagnosis or treatment.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because identifying the correct symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the appropriate treatment. Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomC, this action is valid.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Jones achieves his goal of being healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to prepare for the next patient. This action is not directly related to Jones's health but is necessary for the continuity of care in the hospital.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones** is essential to determine the correct treatment and avoid any mistakes due to Hathaway's high workload.
- **Treating Jones** is the final step to ensure he becomes healthy, which is his primary goal.
