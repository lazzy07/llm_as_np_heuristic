To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room. This will allow Hathaway to treat him based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is also in the admissions room. This is important to determine his symptoms as well.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room, allowing for treatment based on his symptoms.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is already in Exam Room C. This will confirm his symptoms and allow for treatment.
