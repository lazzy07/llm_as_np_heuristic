To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is currently in Exam Room B and has not been assessed yet, this action is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis. This is crucial because Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, and if they do not assess Young, they may not be able to treat them correctly.

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, if they show symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

- Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B to identify their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.
- After assessing Young, if they have a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which will make Young healthy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway can successfully treat Young, thereby achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
