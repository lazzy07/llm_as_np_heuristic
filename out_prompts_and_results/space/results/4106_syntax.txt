To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface, where the volcano could erupt at any moment. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being safe.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe location, reinforcing their friendship and allowing them to bond further.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can reaffirm their friendship in a safe environment. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that both characters feel secure and connected.

5. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action highlights the danger of the surface while emphasizing the safety of the cave.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, they remain unharmed. This action serves to illustrate the danger that they have avoided by moving to the cave.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
