To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (R11). This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C1, I3, C2, R11)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C2). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R11, R12)**: Blake moves to the room where Alex and Casey are located (R11). This is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but allows Blake to be part of the resolution.

4. **move(C2, R11, R12)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex and Blake are (R12). This is also not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but allows for a shared moment of joy among the characters.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to give them the jewelry.
- **give(C1, I3, C2, R11)**: This is the crucial action that makes Casey happy by providing them with the item they desire.
- **move(C3, R11, R12)**: Blake's movement is to ensure they are part of the happy moment, although it does not affect Casey's happiness directly.
- **move(C2, R11, R12)**: Casey's movement to join Alex and Blake is to create a sense of togetherness after receiving the jewelry.
