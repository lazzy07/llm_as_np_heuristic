To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.

2. **Assess Jones**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway should assess Jones in the admissions room as well. This will help Hathaway identify any symptoms Jones may have and provide appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Once Hathaway has assessed Ross and identified his symptoms, they can treat him accordingly. If Ross has Flaze, Hathaway will use antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, Hathaway will use steroids.

4. **Treat Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway should treat Jones based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. Again, if Jones has Flaze, antibiotics will be used; if he has Jarkis, steroids will be used.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Jones receive the necessary treatment, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.
3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Ross based on his symptoms.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Jones based on his symptoms.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat both patients, leading to their health and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
