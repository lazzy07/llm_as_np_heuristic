After taking the Ark from the Nazis, Indiana Jones realizes the danger it poses. He knows that the U.S. Army needs the Ark to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands again. 

1. **Jones travels from Tanis to the USA.** This action is necessary because Indiana needs to deliver the Ark to the U.S. Army, who are currently in the USA.
