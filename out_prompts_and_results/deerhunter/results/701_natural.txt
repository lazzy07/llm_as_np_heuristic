To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to intimidate the bank clerk and force them to give up their money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank to avoid any potential consequences and to find a safe place.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully obtains the money he desires while also maintaining his safety.
