To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential target.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - Bubba is hungry and needs to eat. By shooting Bambi, he can obtain food. This action also aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring resources, as he can later use Bambi's body for sustenance.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - After killing Bambi, Bubba decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain strength.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank. He needs to be at the bank to confront the clerk and achieve his goal of obtaining money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba not only satisfies his hunger but also successfully acquires the money he desires.
