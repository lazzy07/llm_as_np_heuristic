To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially encounter Tom and the Guard. This action is necessary for the Bandit to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is carrying a sword.

2. **report(Merchant, spot: Crossroads, place: Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit's location to the Guard. This action is crucial as it helps the Merchant avoid any criminal activity and potentially gain favor with the Guard, which aligns with her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report. This action is necessary for the Guard to fulfill his duty of eliminating criminals.

4. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard attacks the Bandit, who is unarmed. This action is essential as it removes the Bandit from the story, allowing the Merchant to operate freely without the threat of robbery or violence.

5. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant loots the Bandit's coins from her corpse. This action directly contributes to the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.

6. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market, where she can continue her business without the threat of the Bandit.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal without engaging in any criminal activity herself.
