**Story Completion:**

As day one progresses, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison and avoid the bully's threats. 

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym and potentially lock the bully inside.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him safely.)
3. **Roy sneaks through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Ernest can be safe.)
5. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises Roy, allowing him to blend in and prepare for escape.)
6. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action takes Roy outside the prison, where he can escape.)
7. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This is the final action that achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Roy can eliminate the threat of the bully and escape the prison. Locking the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from retaliating. Killing the bully is necessary to ensure safety for both Roy and Ernest. Putting on civilian clothes is essential for disguise, and crawling through the vents to the highway is the final step to freedom.
