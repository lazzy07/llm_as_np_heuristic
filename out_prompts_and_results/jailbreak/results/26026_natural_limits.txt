**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, but he also knows that he has the cigarettes, which could be a bargaining chip. He moves quickly through the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he confronts the bully.

"Listen, I have your cigarettes," Ernest says, holding them out. "Let's make a deal."

The bully, surprised and momentarily distracted, lowers his guard. In that moment, Ernest seizes the opportunity and uses the knife he had stolen from the kitchen to kill the bully. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now escape.

Ernest quickly leaves the gym, heads back to the hallway, and makes his way to the highway. He puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself further and successfully escapes from the prison.
