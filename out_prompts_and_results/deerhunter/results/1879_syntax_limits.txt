To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the clerk while he has the rifle loaded. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will remain dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
