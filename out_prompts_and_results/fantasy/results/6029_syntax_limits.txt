In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She is already married to Rory, which fulfills her happiness requirement. However, she currently has no wealth. The quickest way for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth is to obtain the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Talia achieve her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels from the Village to the Cave to access the treasure. This action is necessary because the treasure is not in the Village, and Talia needs to go to the Cave to obtain it.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action is essential for her to achieve her goal of wealth, as the treasure will increase her wealth.

After these two actions, Talia will be happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (after picking up the treasure), thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.
