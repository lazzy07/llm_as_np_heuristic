**Story Completion:**

On day one, after completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take action to help both himself and Ernest. He knows that the bully is a threat, and he has the knife, which gives him an advantage. 

Roy moves from the kitchen to the hallway, where he can access the gym. He locks the gym door behind him, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. With the knife in hand, Roy confronts the bully, who is unaware of the impending danger. In a swift motion, Roy kills the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Ernest.

With the bully gone, Roy can now focus on escaping. He puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison, where he successfully escapes.
