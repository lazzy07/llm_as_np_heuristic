To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent can take the following actions:

1. **Move from Cache to Office**: The secret agent needs to confront the mastermind, who is likely in the office, as it is a central location connected to the lobby where the agent just was.

2. **Kill the Mastermind with the Gun in the Office**: Once the secret agent reaches the office, they can use the gun they picked up to kill the mastermind, ensuring the mastermind is dead.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Cache, Office)**: The secret agent moves to the office to find the mastermind. This action is necessary because the agent needs to be in the same location as the mastermind to confront and eliminate them.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the office. This action is the ultimate goal of the secret agent, ensuring that the mastermind is dead.

The story is concise, with only two actions, and directly leads to the desired outcome.
