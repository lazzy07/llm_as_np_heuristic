To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) to be closer to the item they want, which is in the bathroom.
   
2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the bathroom (R12). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R22) after picking up the flowers. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to illustrate Alex's movement.

4. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R22). This action is included to show that Alex has obtained the flowers, but it is not necessary for achieving happiness since Alex is already happy with the flowers.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
