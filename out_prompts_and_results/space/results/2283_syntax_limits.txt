In this story, Zoe and the Lizard have already established a peaceful relationship in the cave. However, the volcano on the surface is about to erupt, which poses a danger to both characters. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have Zoe make a decision that leads to her demise.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the safety of the cave to investigate the situation on the surface, despite the danger posed by the volcano. This action is crucial as it leads her to the dangerous area where the eruption will occur.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After Zoe has walked to the surface, the volcano erupts. This action results in the death of Zoe, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

The story ends with Zoe's decision to leave the cave, which ultimately leads to her demise due to the volcanic eruption. The Lizard remains safe in the cave, and their relationship remains friendly, as they were not fighting at any point.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively achieves the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die while maintaining the established relationship between Zoe and the Lizard.
