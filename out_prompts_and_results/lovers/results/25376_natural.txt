To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness.

2. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but allows Blake to pursue their own happiness by seeking the chocolates, which are in the dining room.

3. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but allows Casey to follow Blake and potentially help in the future.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is not happy because they still do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is not happy because they still do not have the jewelry.

The story ends with Alex achieving their goal of happiness.
