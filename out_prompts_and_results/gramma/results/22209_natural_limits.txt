To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is necessary because it will prompt the guard to take action against the bandit, who is a criminal. By reporting the bandit, Tom ensures that the guard will focus on dealing with the bandit, which will create an opportunity for Tom to acquire the medicine without interference.

2. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action is crucial as it removes the bandit from the market, allowing Tom to safely approach the merchant and acquire the medicine. Since the bandit is armed and a criminal, the guard can attack her without any repercussions.

3. **Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using his coin.**  
   - This action allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires, fulfilling his goal. The merchant is willing to sell the medicine to Tom since she is not a criminal and wants to make a profit.

4. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - This final action takes Tom to his desired location, the cottage, with the medicine in hand.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary actions:

Tom, realizing the danger posed by the bandit in the market, decides to report her location to the guard. The guard, upon receiving the information, swiftly attacks and kills the bandit, ensuring the market is safe. With the bandit out of the way, Tom approaches the merchant and buys the medicine using his coin. Finally, Tom walks back to the cottage, satisfied that he has the medicine he wanted.
