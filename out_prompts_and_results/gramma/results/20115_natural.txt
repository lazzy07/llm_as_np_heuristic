To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit loots the corpse of the merchant to take the medicine and the merchant's sword. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to ensure that the merchant, who is armed, is no longer a threat and to acquire the medicine, which may be valuable.
   
2. The bandit then walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to return to the bandit camp, where the bandit can secure the coins in the chest.

3. Finally, the bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to fulfill the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The story is concise and focuses solely on the actions that lead to the bandit's success.
