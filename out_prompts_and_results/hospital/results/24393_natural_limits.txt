Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3. However, since Jones is alive and has not shown any symptoms of Flaze or Jarkis yet, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the increased workload. 

2. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2. Since Jones does not actually have Jarkis, he dies from the incorrect treatment.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room B, ensuring that Young will be assessed and treated next, which is a step towards achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.

In this story, the actions taken are necessary to illustrate the process of assessment and treatment, even though the outcome for Jones is tragic. The final action of admitting Young is crucial as it sets up the next steps for ensuring the remaining patients receive proper care.
