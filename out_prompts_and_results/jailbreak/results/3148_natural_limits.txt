Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym and believes that he can use this opportunity to eliminate the threat. 

Ernest takes the knife he stole from the kitchen and, while still in the hallway, he unlocks the gym door. He then enters the gym, where the bully is unaware of his presence. With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully and kills him, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then makes his way to the hallway and crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
