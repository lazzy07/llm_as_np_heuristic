Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing the patients to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to gather all patients in one location to assess their symptoms effectively.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Young to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat Young, reducing the workload and ensuring that all patients are seen.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial to identify Young's symptoms, which will allow Dr. Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this treatment will make Young healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, reducing their workload and ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.
