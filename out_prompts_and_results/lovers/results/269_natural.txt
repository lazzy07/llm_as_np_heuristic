To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey currently has the flowers in the living room, and it allows Casey to have the flowers, which is what Alex wants.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action is crucial as it directly transfers the flowers from Casey to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for the flowers.

3. **Alex is now happy.**  
   - With the flowers in hand, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

The other characters, Blake and Casey, remain unhappy because they have not obtained their desired items, but the focus is on Alex's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.",
    "Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers, while the other characters' goals are not prioritized in this specific outcome.
