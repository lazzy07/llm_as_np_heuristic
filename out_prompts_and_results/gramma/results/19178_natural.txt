To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant is located, allowing her to interact with the merchant and potentially acquire coins.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, armed with her sword, can rob the merchant who is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant, which is not her primary goal but could be useful for future interactions.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After robbing the merchant, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to either head back to the bandit camp or to secure her coins.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may have acquired.

By following these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
