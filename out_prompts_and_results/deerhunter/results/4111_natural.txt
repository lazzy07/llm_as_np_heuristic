Bubba is hungry and wants to have money. After shooting Bambi, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he also wants to acquire money, which he can do by stealing it from the bank clerk. Since the clerk is at the bank and Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he can go to the bank and steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy and focus on his next goal.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, making him no longer hungry.
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.
4. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, eliminating the threat and allowing him to take the money.
5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, here’s the explanation of each action:

- **Deciding to eat Bambi** is necessary for Bubba to regain energy and continue with his plans.
- **Eating Bambi** directly satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a prerequisite for him to think clearly about his next actions.
