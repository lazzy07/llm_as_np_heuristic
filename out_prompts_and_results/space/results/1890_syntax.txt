To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Given the current situation, Zoe is on the surface, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has already begun to erupt, which means it is only a matter of time before it finishes erupting.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and potentially resolve their relationship.

2. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Upon reaching the cave, Zoe attacks the Lizard. This action is taken because Zoe believes that the Lizard is a threat to her safety, and she needs to assert herself.

3. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard, in response to the attack, stuns Zoe. This action is necessary to prevent Zoe from continuing her aggressive actions and to establish a moment of vulnerability.

4. **break_free(Zoe, Cave)**: Zoe manages to break free from being stunned. This action allows Zoe to regain her agency and continue interacting with the Lizard.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After breaking free, Zoe realizes that fighting is not the solution and attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship between them.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts. This action is inevitable since the volcano has already begun to erupt, and it will lead to the death of one character.

In this sequence, Zoe and the Lizard go from being potential enemies to friends, while the eruption of the volcano results in Zoe's death. This fulfills the requirement of having a character die and the two characters making friends.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)",
    "attack(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "stun(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)",
    "break_free(Zoe, Cave)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcomes of the story while adhering to the established rules and character motivations.
