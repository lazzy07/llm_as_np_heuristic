To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bubba already has 1 money, we can focus on confirming Bambi's status. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry, and since Bambi is dead, he can eat her. This action helps Bubba satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This confirms that Bambi is dead and fulfills Bubba's hunger.

Now, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and confirmed that Bambi is dead, which meets the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to take action to satisfy that hunger.
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action confirms that Bambi is dead and allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger, ensuring that the story ends with Bambi being dead.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat",
    "Bubba eats Bambi"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively concludes the story with both conditions met: Bubba is alive, and Bambi is confirmed dead.
