To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22) to interact with them and potentially get the flowers.
   
2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This is a truthful statement since Alex genuinely wants the flowers.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12) after receiving the flowers, but this action is not necessary for achieving happiness; it can be omitted if we focus solely on Alex's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken to achieve Alex's goal:

1. Alex moves to the room where Casey is.
2. Alex tells Casey they want the flowers.
3. Casey gives the flowers to Alex.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers they wanted.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers.
