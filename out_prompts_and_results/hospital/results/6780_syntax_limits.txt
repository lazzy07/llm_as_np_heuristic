**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Flaze, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Ross is the first patient assessed, and Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has a fever, indicating Flaze.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Jarkis, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in Exam Room B. Again, Hathaway's workload is still 3, but since Jones is the second patient assessed, Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has a rash, indicating Jarkis.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Steroids, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. Jones becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment. 
- The second action is crucial as it treats Ross for Flaze, allowing him to recover and reducing Hathaway's workload.
- The third action assesses Jones, which is essential to identify his condition and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment.
- The fourth action treats Jones for Jarkis, ensuring he also recovers and further reducing Hathaway's workload.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
