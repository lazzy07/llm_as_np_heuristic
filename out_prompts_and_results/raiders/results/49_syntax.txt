To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the following actions will take place:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis are already in Tanis, and they need to travel to the USA where the Ark is currently located. This action is necessary for them to reach the Ark.

2. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: The Nazis will take the Ark from the US Army by force. This is essential because they need to possess the Ark to open it and achieve their goal of immortality.

3. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: The Nazis will open the Ark. Since the Ark is not dangerous (as indicated by the current situation), this action will grant them immortality.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Nazis travel from Tanis to the USA to reach the Ark.
- They take the Ark from the US Army, ensuring they have control over it.
- Finally, they open the Ark, which, being safe, grants them immortality.
