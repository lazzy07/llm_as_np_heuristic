Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands in the market, where the bandit has just robbed the merchant and is now carrying Tom's coin. The guard, also present, is unaware of the bandit's criminal actions. 

1. **Tom attacks the bandit.** This action is necessary because Tom needs to eliminate the bandit to retrieve his coin and the medicine. Since the bandit is not armed with a sword, Tom can successfully attack her.

2. **Tom loots the bandit's corpse.** After defeating the bandit, Tom can take the items the bandit was carrying, which includes his coin. This action is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

3. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.** With the coin and the medicine now in his possession, Tom can finally make his way to the cottage, fulfilling his goal.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to overcome the bandit, reclaim his coin, and secure the medicine, leading him to his desired location.
