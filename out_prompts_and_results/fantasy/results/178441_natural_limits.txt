In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. Since she is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness is tied to their actions. 

To achieve her goal of wealth, Talia needs to acquire the treasure that is located in the cave. Gargax, being a dragon, is likely to be protective of the treasure. However, since Gargax is not concerned with happiness, he may be persuaded to part with the treasure if he can gain something in return.
