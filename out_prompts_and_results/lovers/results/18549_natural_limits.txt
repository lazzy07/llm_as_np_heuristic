Alex is in the dining room, wanting the flowers that Casey has placed in the living room. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to move to the living room to pick up the flowers.

**Action:**
1. Alex moves from the dining room to the living room.

**Explanation:**

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the living room with the flowers.
- Blake is in the bathroom, still unhappy because they want the chocolates.
