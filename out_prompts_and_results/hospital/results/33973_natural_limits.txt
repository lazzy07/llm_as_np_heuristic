Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Given that Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with antibiotics, believing that Young might have Flaze. This action is crucial because it reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one, and if Young has Flaze, this treatment will make them healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Jones, who is still in Admissions. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and finds that he is experiencing unknown symptoms. Given the situation, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis due to the high workload. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Young again. Young is now healthy due to the antibiotics treatment. Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy is achieved.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on treatment.
2. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: This action is essential to make Young healthy, which is part of Dr. Hathaway's goal.

5. **Return to Patient Room A to assess Young again**: This confirms Young's health status after treatment.
