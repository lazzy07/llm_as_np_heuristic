Tom, the hero, stands at the crossroads, desperate to get back to the cottage with the medicine. The merchant is also at the crossroads, holding Tom's coin. The bandit, armed and dangerous, has just purchased the medicine from the merchant and is now a threat to both Tom and the merchant.

To achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the merchant decides to take a calculated risk. She reports the bandit's location to the guard, who is at the market. This action is crucial because it brings the guard to the crossroads, where he can confront the bandit.

The guard, upon arriving at the crossroads, sees the bandit and, armed with his sword, attacks her. The bandit, unable to defend herself, is killed. The merchant then loots the bandit's corpse, taking the coins she desires.

In this way, the merchant successfully achieves her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as she did not directly rob anyone but instead reported the bandit, leading to her demise.
