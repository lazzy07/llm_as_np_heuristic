To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Casey is currently happy with the jewelry, Blake needs to trade for it. Here’s the shortest story to achieve that:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** This action is necessary because it misleads Casey into thinking that Alex is the one who wants the jewelry, which may prompt Casey to consider trading it.
   - Action: `tell(C2, C3, I3, R12)`

2. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.** Since Casey believes that Alex wants the jewelry, they might be willing to give it to Blake, thinking it will make Alex happy.
   - Action: `give(C3, I3, C2, R12)`

3. **Blake is now happy because they have the jewelry.** This completes Blake's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I3, R12)** - Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry, which influences Casey's decision.
2. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)** - Casey gives the jewelry to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C2, C3, I3, R12)",
    "give(C3, I3, C2, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry through strategic communication and action.
