To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to go back to the bank. He enters the bank and confronts the clerk, who is unaware of Bambi's fate. Bubba, with the rifle still in hand, decides to steal the money from the clerk. The clerk, believing Bubba is harmless, does not resist. Bubba successfully takes the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirement.
