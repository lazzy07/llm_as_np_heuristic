To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomC with Jones, the first action will be to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, they will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If Jones has a rash, they will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: Next, Hathaway will walk back to Admissions to assess Ross. This is necessary because Ross is currently in Admissions and needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will walk back to Admissions to assess Young. This is necessary to evaluate Young's condition.

6. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients effectively, ensuring they all become healthy.
