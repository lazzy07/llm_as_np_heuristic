To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to fulfill his goal of being there with the medicine.

This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal, as he already has the medicine after looting it from the Merchant.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to move from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be. Since he has the medicine, once he reaches the Cottage, he will have achieved his goal.
