**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife. He quickly moves to the hallway, where he can access the gym. 

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. He then enters the gym, confronting the bully. With the knife in hand, Roy takes a deep breath and kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
