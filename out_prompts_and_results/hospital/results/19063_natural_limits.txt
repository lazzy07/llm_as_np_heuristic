Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, is currently at Patient Room A with Jones, who is experiencing a rash. Since the rash indicates that Jones has Jarkis, Hathaway decides to treat Jones with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. 

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload decreases by one, and Jones becomes healthy. With Jones now healthy, Hathaway can focus on the next patient. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to assess him to determine the appropriate treatment.

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids (to address the rash).
2. Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross.

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway successfully treats Jones and prepares to help Ross, ultimately achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
