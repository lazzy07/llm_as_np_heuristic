To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to reach the location where the treasure is located, which is essential for him to become wealthy.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - By picking up the treasure, Vince increases his wealth, which is one of his primary goals.

3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village to be with Talia and Rory, which is important for his happiness.

4. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to Vince, this action is redundant but can be seen as a reaffirmation of their bond, contributing to Vince's happiness.

5. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**  
   - This action reinforces their relationship, ensuring that both characters feel happy.

6. **Vince and Talia get married.**  
   - This formalizes their relationship, contributing to Vince's happiness.

7. **Vince becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is necessary to create a scenario where Vince can eat and satisfy his hunger.

8. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is included to create a dramatic twist, but it ultimately leads to Vince's demise, which contradicts his goal of being happy and not hungry. However, since the goal is to achieve wealth, the treasure remains with Vince until the end.

In this story, Vince successfully picks up the treasure and returns to the village, achieving his goal of wealth. However, the ending is tragic as he is eaten by Gargax, which prevents him from achieving happiness and not being hungry.
