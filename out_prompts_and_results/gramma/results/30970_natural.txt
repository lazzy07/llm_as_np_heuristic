To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a position to interact with the hero and the guard, as she needs to sell items to them to gain coins.

2. **The merchant sells the medicine to the hero for the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain a coin while providing the hero with the medicine he desires. The merchant's goal is to collect coins without engaging in criminal activity, and selling the medicine is a legitimate transaction.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard's arrival at the crossroads is important as it ensures that he is present to witness the merchant's legitimate transaction, reinforcing her non-criminal status.

4. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to be in a location where she can potentially sell more items or interact with other characters, furthering her goal of acquiring coins.

At this point, the merchant has successfully sold the medicine and gained a coin, achieving her goal without engaging in any criminal activity.
