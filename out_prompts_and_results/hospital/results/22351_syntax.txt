To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has SymptomA, Hathaway needs to assess him to confirm his symptoms.
2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room to treat him.
3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room C**: Ross will walk to the exam room where he will be treated.
4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: Since Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics to ensure he becomes healthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: This action is necessary to confirm Ross's symptoms, which is crucial for determining the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, she can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake.
   
2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: This action is required to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be treated. It also increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but since she has already assessed Ross, she can still treat him correctly.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary for Ross to be in the correct location for treatment. It ensures that he is physically present in the exam room where Hathaway can treat him.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: This is the final and crucial action that will ensure Ross becomes healthy. Since he has Flaze (SymptomA), treating him with antibiotics is the correct course of action.

After these actions, all patients will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
