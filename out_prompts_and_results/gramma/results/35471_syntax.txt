To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly, which is one of her goals.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is essential as it allows her to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that she has the coins stored safely, further solidifying her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action (robbing Tom) is crucial because it directly increases the Bandit's coin count, which is a primary objective for her.
- The second action (walking to the camp) is necessary to transition from the Crossroads to a location where she can secure her coins.
- The third action (taking coins from the chest) ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest, thus completing her objective.
