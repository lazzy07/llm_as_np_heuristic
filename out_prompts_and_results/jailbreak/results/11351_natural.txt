**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the kitchen, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy sneaks back through the vent to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to return to the prison and help Ernest.)
2. **Roy moves to the kitchen.** (Roy needs to reach Ernest to inform him of the plan and ensure his safety.)
3. **Roy tells Ernest to lock the gym door.** (This action is crucial to prevent the bully from coming after them while they make their escape.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This secures their safety from the bully.)
5. **Roy and Ernest then move to the hallway.** (They need to get to the highway together for the escape.)
6. **Roy and Ernest crawl through the vent to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)
7. **Roy and Ernest put on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises them, allowing them to blend in and avoid detection.)
8. **Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** (This is the ultimate goal of both characters, ensuring their survival.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy and Ernest is aimed at ensuring their safety from the bully and ultimately escaping the prison. The locking of the gym door is a strategic move to prevent the bully from attacking them while they make their escape. The use of the vent allows them to bypass the main areas of the prison where they could be caught. Finally, putting on civilian clothes is essential for their disguise, allowing them to leave the prison unnoticed.
