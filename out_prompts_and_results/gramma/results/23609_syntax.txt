To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure a location where she can store her coins.

2. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coin she robbed from Tom and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully secured the coin, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by moving to a safe location (the Bandit Camp) and storing the coin there.
