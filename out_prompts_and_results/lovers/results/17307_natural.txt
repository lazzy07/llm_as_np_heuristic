**Story Completion:**

In the dining room, Alex, Blake, and Casey stand surrounded by the items they desire. Alex, holding the jewelry, looks at the flowers and wishes to have them. Blake, eyeing the chocolates, feels unsatisfied. Casey, however, has a plan.

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.** (This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and it is currently with Alex.)
2. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.** (This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of obtaining the jewelry, as Blake is now holding it.)
3. **Blake, now holding the jewelry, gives the chocolates to Casey.** (Blake wants the chocolates, and by giving them to Casey, he can achieve his own happiness.)
4. **Casey puts down the chocolates.** (This action is not necessary for achieving Casey's goal but is included to show that Casey is now satisfied with the chocolates.)

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex is still unhappy because they do not have the flowers.

- Casey picks up the jewelry to fulfill their desire for it.
- Casey gives the jewelry to Blake to ensure that Blake is happy, which is also part of Casey's goal.
- Blake gives the chocolates to Casey, allowing both characters to achieve their happiness.
