In the current situation, Rory is in the Village, while Talia is in the Cave with the Treasure. Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Since he has already proposed to Talia and she accepted, they are in a relationship, which contributes to Rory's happiness. However, Rory needs to acquire the Treasure to achieve wealth.

To achieve this, Rory can take the following actions:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory needs to go to the Cave where Talia is located and where the Treasure is. This action is necessary for Rory to be able to access the Treasure.

2. **Pick up the Treasure**: Once Rory arrives at the Cave, he can pick up the Treasure. This action will make Rory wealthy, fulfilling his goal.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the Cave to be with Talia and to access the Treasure. This is essential for him to achieve his goal of wealth.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the Treasure, which makes him wealthy. This fulfills his goal of being wealthy and contributes to his happiness since he is now with Talia.

After these actions, Rory is happy because he is in a relationship with Talia, wealthy because he has the Treasure, and not hungry since there is no indication of hunger in the story.
