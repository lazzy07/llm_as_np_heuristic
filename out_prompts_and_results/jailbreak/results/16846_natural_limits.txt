**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Roy, still in the gym, felt the weight of the bully's threats hanging over him. He knew he had to act quickly. With the cigarettes in his possession, he decided to use them as leverage. He approached the bully, trying to negotiate a truce. "Look, I have your cigarettes. Let's not escalate this," he said, hoping to buy some time.

Meanwhile, Ernest, still in the kitchen, was unaware of the tense situation in the gym. He finished his chores and decided to check on Roy. He moved to the hallway, planning to go to the gym to see if Roy was okay. However, as he reached the hallway, he overheard the bully's menacing voice coming from the gym.

In a moment of desperation, Roy made a bold move. He took the cigarettes and threw them at the bully, hoping to distract him. As the bully lunged for the cigarettes, Roy seized the opportunity to lock the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. 

Ernest, hearing the commotion, rushed to the gym door, but it was locked. He realized that Roy had managed to outsmart the bully. With the bully trapped, Roy quickly made his way to the laundry room, where he found the civilian clothes. He put them on, disguising himself.

With the disguise on, Roy crawled through the vents to the highway, successfully escaping the prison. He looked back one last time, knowing that he had overcome the bully's threats and secured his freedom.
