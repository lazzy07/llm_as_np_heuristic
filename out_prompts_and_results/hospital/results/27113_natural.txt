**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing symptoms of Flaze (fever). Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the high workload. 

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, this is incorrect, and Ross dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway moves to assess Young in Patient Room B.

3. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing symptoms of Flaze. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

4. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, and Young dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Jones.

5. **Walk from Patient Room B to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing symptoms of Flaze. Due to her workload being reduced to 1 after treating Young, she correctly identifies Jones's condition.

7. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, and Jones becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Ross and Young is necessary to determine their conditions, even though mistakes are made due to the high workload.
