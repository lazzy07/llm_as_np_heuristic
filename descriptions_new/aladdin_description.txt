The problem is an alternative version of the tale of Aladdin, which was added to a later edition of One Thousand and One Nights and later adapted into a 1992 Disney film with some elements been changed. Jafar is king, not adviser to the king. A dragon has been added. The end of the story has been changed. Jasmine should be married to Jafar and the genie should be dead. Everyone wants to be alive and unafraid. Aladdin, Jafar, and Jasmine each want to be happy. Servants want to do what their masters command them to do. The story must end with either Jafar being married to Jasmine or the genie being dead. There are 5 characters: Aladdin, Jafar, Jasmine, Dragon and Genie. Also there are 2 places: Castle and Mountain.
