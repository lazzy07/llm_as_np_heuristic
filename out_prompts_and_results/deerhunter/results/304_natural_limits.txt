Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, decides to confront the bank clerk. He points the rifle at the clerk, who is startled but remains calm. Bubba demands the clerk's money. The clerk, realizing the situation, hands over the 1 money to Bubba without resistance. Satisfied, Bubba leaves the bank with the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk**: This action is implied as Bubba is already at the bank and is confronting the clerk.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not taken because Bubba's goal is to get money, and shooting the clerk would not help him achieve that goal.
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Instead, Bubba demands the money, and the clerk willingly gives it to him, which is a more efficient way to achieve his goal without unnecessary violence.
4. **Bubba leaves the bank with the money**: This final action signifies that Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of obtaining 1 money.

The story is kept short and direct, focusing on Bubba's goal of acquiring money without unnecessary complications.
