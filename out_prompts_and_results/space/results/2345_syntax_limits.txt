2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

With this action, the Lizard achieves its goal of making friends with Zoe, and they both feel safe and healthy together.
