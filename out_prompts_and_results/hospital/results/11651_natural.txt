**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives attention and treatment, as he is currently in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Again, Ross is experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway can still treat him based on the assumption that he may have one of the two diseases.

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown, this treatment is a risk, but it is necessary to attempt to help him.

Dr. Hathaway's workload is now reduced to 1 after treating Ross. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young. This is important because Young is also in need of treatment, and Hathaway must ensure all patients are attended to.

Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This action is crucial to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room and can receive treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway can treat him with steroids, assuming he might have Jarkis.

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This ensures that Young becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients have been treated, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
