To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** (Rory needs to be at the village to interact with Talia and Vince.)
2. **Rory proposes to Talia.** (Rory wants to marry Talia to increase his happiness.)
3. **Talia accepts the proposal.** (This action is necessary for Rory's happiness.)
4. **Rory and Talia get married.** (This solidifies their relationship and increases Rory's happiness.)
5. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (Rory needs to become wealthy, and since Vince is alive, this action cannot happen. Instead, we will assume Vince becomes hungry and dies, allowing Rory to take the money.)
6. **Rory becomes hungry.** (This action is necessary for the story to progress towards Vince's death.)
7. **Gargax eats Vince.** (This action allows Rory to take the money from Vince's dead body.)
8. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (Now that Vince is dead, Rory can take the money.)
9. **Rory's wealth increases.** (Rory now has the money, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy.)
10. **Rory's hunger decreases.** (Rory can now eat, ensuring he is not hungry.)

This sequence of actions leads to Rory achieving his goals of happiness, wealth, and not being hungry.
