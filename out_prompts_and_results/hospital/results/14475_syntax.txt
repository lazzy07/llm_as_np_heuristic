To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomB, they need to walk to PatientRoomA to assess Ross. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, and if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk back to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway needs to return to the admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Young.

4. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: Based on Young's symptoms, Hathaway will treat them accordingly. This will ensure Young also becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: Based on Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat them accordingly, ensuring that all patients are healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions taken in the story:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat(Ross)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the symptoms identified.
3. **Walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks back to the admissions room.
4. **Assess(Young)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms.
5. **Treat(Young)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the symptoms identified.
6. **Assess(Jones)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine their symptoms.
7. **Treat(Jones)**: Hathaway treats Jones based on the symptoms identified.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:
