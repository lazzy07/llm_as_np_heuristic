To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Young's symptoms will help Hathaway decide on the correct treatment for Ross, as the doctor currently has a workload of 3 and may make a mistake if they assess Ross directly.

2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above; it will help Hathaway understand the overall situation and avoid mistakes.

3. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Young becomes healthy, which will reduce Hathaway's workload.

4. **Treat Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones also becomes healthy, further reducing Hathaway's workload.

5. **Assess Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine their symptoms. This is essential to ensure that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment for Ross.

6. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is the final step to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can effectively manage their workload and ensure that all patients, including Ross, achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
