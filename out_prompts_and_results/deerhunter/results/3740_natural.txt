To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants money and the clerk has it.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money without resistance.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to be in a safe place with the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and the clerk has it.
- **Steal the money:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money, as he takes it from the clerk.
- **Go to the house:** This action is taken to ensure Bubba is in a safe location after acquiring the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has successfully obtained the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead from the earlier shooting.
