**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing that Young might have Flaze. Unfortunately, this is incorrect since Young is actually experiencing Jarkis. As a result, Young does not become healthy and dies.

Dr. Hathaway then walks back to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Since both are still in Admissions, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats Jones with antibiotics. This is also incorrect, and Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats Ross with antibiotics. Ross dies as well.

In the end, all patients are dead, but Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is not achieved. However, the story can be adjusted to ensure that at least one patient survives.
