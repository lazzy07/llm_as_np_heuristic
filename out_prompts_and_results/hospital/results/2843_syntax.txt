To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Jones has Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to identify the symptoms. This is essential for determining the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will assume Hathaway correctly identifies the disease.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats them with the correct treatment based on the identified symptoms. This action is vital for Jones to recover and achieve their goal of being healthy.
