In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (flowers) to be happy, and they are in the same room (R22) as the flowers. However, both Casey (C3) and Blake (C2) are also in the room, and none of them are currently happy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the flowers (I1) that are in the room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers in the room, which fulfills their desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is the item they wanted.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is the only item they want to achieve happiness. Since the flowers are in the same room (R22), Alex can easily pick them up.
