Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action in the forest where he has found Bambi. He loads the ammunition into the rifle, preparing to hunt. With the rifle now loaded, Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. He then decides to eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger. After eating, Bubba finds that he has enough energy to think clearly and realizes he can take Bambi's body to the bank to sell for money.
