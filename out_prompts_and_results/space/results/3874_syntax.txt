To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship for safety.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action solidifies the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends with other creatures.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe can safely teleport back to her spaceship. Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, since they are now friends, it is acceptable for Zoe to leave the surface without causing conflict.

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace**: This action is crucial as it establishes a positive relationship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship.
