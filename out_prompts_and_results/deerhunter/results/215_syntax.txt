To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is hungry and has a rifle and ammunition. He needs to load the rifle to be able to shoot Bambi if he decides to do so. This action prepares him for a potential kill.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: After loading the rifle, Bubba can shoot Bambi. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to consume the animal he has killed.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can decide to get money. Since he is now satisfied and has fulfilled his hunger, he can focus on acquiring money.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba can go to the bank where the clerk is located to potentially acquire the money.

6. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If Bubba reaches the bank and the clerk is still alive, he can steal the money from the clerk using his rifle as a threat.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
