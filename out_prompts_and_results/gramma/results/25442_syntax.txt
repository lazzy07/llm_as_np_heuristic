To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Bandit)**: The Merchant walks to the Bandit, who is currently at the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Merchant to interact with the Bandit and potentially acquire coins.

2. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Bandit)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, robs the Bandit, taking the coins the Bandit has. This action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to gain coins without becoming a criminal, as the Bandit is already a criminal.

3. **walk(Merchant, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks back to the Crossroads after robbing the Bandit. This action is necessary to return to a neutral location where she can assess her situation.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant then walks to the Market. This action is important as it allows her to be in her preferred location, where she can sell her items or further interact with other characters.

5. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, MerchantCoin, Market)**: Finally, the Merchant buys the Medicine from herself, using the coins she just acquired. This action is the culmination of her goal, as it allows her to maximize her coins while obtaining an item of value.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal without crossing into criminality, as she only robs a criminal and uses her own coins to buy the Medicine.
