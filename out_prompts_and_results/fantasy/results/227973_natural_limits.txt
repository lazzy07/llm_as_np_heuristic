To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** 

This action is necessary because Gargax, who is at the cave with Talia, wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Talia, Gargax can gain wealth from her, which is the treasure that is at the cave. Since Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness is not dependent on her being alive, as she has already achieved a level of wealth (1) through her marriage to Vince. However, her happiness is still at 0, and by being eaten, she can be considered to have fulfilled her desire for wealth (as she is now part of Gargax's hoard) and thus indirectly achieve her goal of happiness through the fulfillment of Gargax's desire.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the action:
- Gargax eats Talia: This action allows Gargax to gain the treasure, which fulfills his desire for wealth. Talia, although dead, can be considered to have achieved her goal of being wealthy through this action, as she is now part of Gargax's wealth.
