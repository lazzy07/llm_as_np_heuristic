To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will take place:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential source of food or distraction.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba returns to the bank to confront the clerk. Since Bubba is hungry and wants money, he needs to take action to get the money from the clerk.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal the money from the clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any potential confrontation with the clerk.

At this point, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of obtaining 1 money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions of moving between locations are necessary to set up the final action of stealing the money. Bubba needs to be at the bank to confront the clerk, and he needs to be in the forest to potentially interact with Bambi, although Bambi is not directly involved in the final outcome.
- The stealing action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money.
- The final movement back to the forest is a precautionary measure to ensure Bubba is not caught after the theft.
