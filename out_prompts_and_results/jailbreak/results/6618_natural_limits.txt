**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to secure his safety and get the pack of cigarettes. He quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he can access the gym. 

Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot reach him or Roy, alleviating the immediate threat. 

With the bully locked away, Ernest then crawls through the vents to the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. 

Finally, with the disguise on, Ernest escapes from the prison, leaving behind the threats and danger.
