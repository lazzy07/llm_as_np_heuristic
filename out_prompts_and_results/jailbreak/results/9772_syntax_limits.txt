After finishing their chores in the laundry, Roy and Ernest are aware of the bully's presence in the gym and the threat he poses. Roy, having stolen the pack of cigarettes earlier, knows that the bully will be looking for them. To ensure their safety and to avoid confrontation, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Disguise (Roy, Clothes, Laundry)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. This disguise will help him blend in and avoid being recognized by the guards or the bully when he makes his escape.
