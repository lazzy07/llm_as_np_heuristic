To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard is already on the surface and can walk back to the cave. This action is necessary to set the Lizard in a position where it can be affected by the volcano's eruption.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a critical event that will lead to a character dying. Since the Lizard is on the surface, it will be affected by the eruption.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: After the eruption, Zoe can make peace with the Lizard. This action is important because it allows them to become friends despite the dangerous situation.

The final sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe to establish a friendship with the Lizard before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: This action is necessary to ensure the Lizard is in a location where it can be affected by the eruption.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which is essential for the story's climax and results in the Lizard's death.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe to establish a friendship with the Lizard, fulfilling her goal of making friends, even in the face of danger.
