Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, establishing a friendship that could help them both achieve their goals of safety and health. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate threat of eruption.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure that her friend is safe. This action reinforces their friendship and shows her commitment to the Lizard's well-being.

3. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** Zoe leads the Lizard to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps both characters find a secure place, ensuring their health and safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave.** By remaining in the cave, they avoid the dangers of the surface and the erupting volcano. This action solidifies their safety and health.

Through these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard. The Lizard, in turn, also achieves its goals of health, safety, and friendship.
