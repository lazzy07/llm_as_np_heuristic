In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want item I2, which is currently unknown to them. However, they know that Alex (C1) wants item I1, which is with Casey (C3). To help Alex and ultimately achieve their own happiness, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Tell Blake that Casey has I2**: Blake can tell Alex that Casey has the item they want (I2), even though this is a lie. This will lead Alex to believe that they can get what they want from Casey, which will make Blake feel accomplished in helping Alex.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that Casey has the item I2, which is a lie. This action is necessary because it creates a false belief in Alex that they can get what they want, which indirectly helps Blake feel like they are contributing to Alex's happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex believes they can get I2 from Casey, which may lead them to take further actions to achieve their happiness.
- Blake feels satisfied that they have helped Alex, even if it was through a lie.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This story is short and effective, as it only includes one action that leads to Blake feeling accomplished in their goal of helping Alex, even if it doesn't directly lead to anyone's happiness.
