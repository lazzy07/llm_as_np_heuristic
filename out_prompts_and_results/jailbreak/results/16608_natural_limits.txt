**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to escape from the prison. He crawls through the vents from the hallway to the highway outside the prison. Once he reaches the highway, he successfully escapes, leaving the prison behind.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Crawl through the vents to the highway:** This action allows Ernest to leave the prison without being detected by the bully or the guards. Since he is disguised in civilian clothes, he can escape without being recognized.

This is the shortest story where Ernest achieves his goal of being alive and not threatened, while also obtaining a pack of cigarettes indirectly through Roy's earlier actions.
