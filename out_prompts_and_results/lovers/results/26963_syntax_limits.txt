In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (I1), which is the jewelry. However, Casey is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2), which is the chocolates. 

To achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy while also ensuring Casey is happy, Blake can take the following action:

1. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the chocolates, making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex remains happy with the jewelry (I1).
- Casey becomes happy because they now have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake is happy because they have made both Alex and Casey happy.

This single action fulfills Blake's goal of ensuring happiness for both Alex and Casey.
