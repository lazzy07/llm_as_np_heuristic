To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and has a desire for money. He needs to go to the Bank where the Clerk is located to potentially steal the money. This action is necessary to move him closer to his goal.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: After arriving at the Bank, Bubba can choose to shoot Bambi, who is also in the Forest. This action will result in Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions of the ending.

This sequence of actions is the shortest way to achieve the goal, as it directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the two possible endings.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where he can interact with the Clerk and potentially steal money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
