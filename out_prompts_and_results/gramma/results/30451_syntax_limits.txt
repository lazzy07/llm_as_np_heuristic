Tom is at the bandit camp with the merchant. He knows that the merchant has the medicine he needs to carry back to the cottage. Since Tom is armed with a sword, he decides to rob the merchant to take the medicine.

**Action:**
- rob(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Camp)

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage. By robbing the merchant, he can take the medicine directly from her without needing to negotiate or trade, which would take more time and effort. 

After this action, Tom successfully has the medicine and can now return to the cottage.
