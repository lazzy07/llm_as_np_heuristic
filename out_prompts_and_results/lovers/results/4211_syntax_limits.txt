In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want I3 (chocolates), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want I2 (flowers). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can give Casey the chocolates.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C1, I2, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey in the living room (R21). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want (I3 - chocolates).

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, as it directly addresses Casey's desire.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C1, I2, C3, R21)**: This action is necessary because it allows Alex to fulfill Casey's desire for chocolates, thus making Casey happy. Since Alex's goal is to ensure Casey's happiness, this action directly aligns with that objective.
