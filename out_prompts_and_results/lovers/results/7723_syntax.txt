To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R12). This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R12). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but can be included to show that Casey is now content and can move freely.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
