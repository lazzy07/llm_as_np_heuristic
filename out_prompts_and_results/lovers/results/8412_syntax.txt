To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R12) where Blake is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to help Casey, even though it does not directly make Casey happy. However, it sets up the next action.

3. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R12)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Blake for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This is the crucial action that allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
