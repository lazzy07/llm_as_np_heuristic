**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Dr. Hathaway believes Jones is alive and healthy. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload and treats Jones with steroids. This treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. This treatment is also incorrect, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 3, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Despite the mistakes made due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are treated is achieved, albeit tragically.
