To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 2, they can assess Young, who is in the admissions room. This will help determine if Young has any symptoms that need to be treated.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room B. This will allow Hathaway to treat Young based on the symptoms found during the assessment.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine if Jones has any symptoms that need treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash) or Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them accordingly. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them based on their symptoms. This will ensure Jones also becomes healthy.
