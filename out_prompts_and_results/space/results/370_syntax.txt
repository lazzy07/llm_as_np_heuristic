To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe walks from the Surface to the Cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Zoe to explore the cave and potentially find a way to help the Lizard feel safe and healthy.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard in the Cave.**  
   - This action is crucial as it solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters are no longer in conflict. It aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

3. **Zoe walks from the Cave back to the Surface.**  
   - Zoe needs to return to the surface to assess the situation with the volcano and ensure both she and the Lizard can remain safe.

4. **Zoe teleports to the Ship from the Surface.**  
   - This action allows Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensure her safety, while also keeping the Lizard safe by not being on the surface when the volcano erupts.

5. **The volcano erupts on the Surface.**  
   - This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting, but since Zoe is on the ship, she is safe, and the Lizard is in the cave, which is also safe from the eruption.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe, while also making a friend in Zoe.
