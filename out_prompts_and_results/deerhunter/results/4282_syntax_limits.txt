In this story, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba is still hungry and has a desire for money. The only character with money is the bank clerk, who is currently at the bank. To achieve the goal of Bubba having the money, he needs to go back to the bank and take the money from the clerk.
