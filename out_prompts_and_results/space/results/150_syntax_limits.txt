Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt. She knows she needs to make friends with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. Instead of attacking or teleporting away, she decides to approach the Lizard peacefully.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the cave where the Lizard is and calls out to him, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to stay safe from the volcano. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring safety.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard, intrigued by Zoe's offer, walks out of the cave to meet her on the surface. This action is necessary for the Lizard to engage with Zoe and consider her proposal.

3. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Once they are together on the surface, the Lizard accepts Zoe's friendship, realizing that they can help each other survive the eruption. This final action solidifies their friendship and ensures both characters feel safe and healthy.

With these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of friendship and safety.
