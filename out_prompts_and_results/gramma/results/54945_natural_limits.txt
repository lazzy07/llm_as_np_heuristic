Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands in the market, where the merchant has just been killed. The bandit, also armed, has taken Tom's coin and is aware of the situation. The guard, who is also present, is focused on maintaining order and eliminating criminals.

To achieve his goal of getting to the cottage carrying the medicine, Tom needs to act quickly. He decides to attack the bandit, who is a criminal and poses a threat to him. 

Tom attacks the bandit with the sword he purchased from the merchant. Since the bandit is not armed with a sword, Tom successfully kills the bandit. After the bandit is dead, Tom loots the bandit's body and retrieves his coin. 

Now, with the bandit defeated and the coin retrieved, Tom can take the medicine from the merchant's body. He picks up the medicine and, with both the medicine and his coin, he walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal.
