Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to the Admissions room to assess the remaining patients, Jones and Ross, who are still waiting.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis and treats him with steroids.

5. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones has Flaze, and he dies as well.

6. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids.

7. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect since Ross has Flaze, and he dies as well.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's actions lead to the unfortunate outcome of all patients dying due to misdiagnosis caused by the high workload. However, the goal of Dr. Hathaway wanting all patients to be healthy is not achieved, as the workload led to mistakes.
