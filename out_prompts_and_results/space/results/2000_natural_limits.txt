Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard, who is still in danger. She understands that making friends with the Lizard is essential for both of them to feel safe and healthy. 

Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface. Upon arrival, she sees the Lizard and approaches cautiously, expressing her desire to help and make friends. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, agrees to work together to find a safe place away from the volcano. They both walk together to the cave, where they can be safe from the eruption.

This action is included because it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters' safety and health.
