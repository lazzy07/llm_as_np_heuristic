To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, a character dies, and the two characters become friends. Given the current situation, Zoe is in the cave, and the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano has already begun to erupt, which adds urgency to the situation.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary because the Lizard is on the surface, and Zoe needs to be there to interact with the Lizard and potentially make peace.

2. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attacks the Lizard. This action is taken to create a conflict that can lead to a resolution. Since the relationship is currently negative, this action will escalate the situation.

3. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard stuns Zoe in response to the attack. This action is necessary to show that the Lizard is defending itself and to create a moment where Zoe is vulnerable.

4. **break_free(Zoe, Surface)**: Zoe breaks free from being stunned. This action allows Zoe to regain control of the situation and continue her efforts to resolve the conflict.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it shifts the relationship from negative to positive, allowing them to become friends.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is the climax of the story, leading to the death of one character.

7. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption kills the Lizard. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

In summary, the actions taken lead to a conflict that ultimately resolves in friendship, but the eruption results in the Lizard's death. This sequence of events captures the essence of the characters' goals while adhering to the constraints of the story.
