To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard will initiate a peace-making action with Zoe in the cave. This action is crucial because both characters are currently not fighting, and it allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of the Lizard's goals.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that the Lizard can monitor the situation outside, especially since the surface is currently dangerous due to the volcano.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the surface. This action is important as it keeps both characters together and safe from the potential eruption of the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is included to demonstrate the danger of the surface and to highlight the importance of the characters being in the cave before the eruption.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: After the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard will reaffirm their friendship on the surface. This action solidifies their bond and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of making friends with Zoe while ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy.
