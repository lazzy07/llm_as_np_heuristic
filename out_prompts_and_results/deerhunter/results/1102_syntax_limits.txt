To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed for money. The clerk is also greedy but is not in a position to defend himself since Bubba has the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk, killing him. This action is necessary because it eliminates the only obstacle between Bubba and the money in the bank. 

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to eliminate the bank clerk, who is a threat to Bubba's greed for money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk without any repercussions.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money from the bank, fulfilling his greedy desire.
