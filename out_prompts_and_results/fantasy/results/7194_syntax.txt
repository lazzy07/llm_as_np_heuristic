To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, who has already proposed to her. The quickest way for Talia to achieve happiness is to accept Vince's proposal and marry him, as this will make both of them happy. Since Talia already has the treasure, she will be wealthy as well.
