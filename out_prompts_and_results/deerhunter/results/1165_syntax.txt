To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank and has stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed level of 1, indicating he wants more money. The clerk has no money, and Bambi is alive in the forest, which is not directly relevant to Bubba's goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to potentially access any money he might have. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank, and Bubba's greed drives him to take any money available.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a way to utilize the situation to his advantage. Although it may seem unusual, it is a way for Bubba to gain sustenance.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money again, reinforcing his greed and ensuring he is focused on acquiring wealth.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will go to the forest, where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to continue his pursuit of money, as he may find opportunities there.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, who is a potential threat and may have money.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger by consuming the clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Moves Bubba to a new location where he can continue his quest for money.
