To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action is to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat Jones and Young, who are currently waiting there. This is important to ensure that all patients are attended to.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Once Hathaway reaches the Admissions room, the next action is to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure all patients are treated.

7. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
