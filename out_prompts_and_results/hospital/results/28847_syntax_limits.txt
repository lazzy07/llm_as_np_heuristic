In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure that all patients are healthy. The current situation shows that Hathaway has a workload of 2, which allows for the possibility of correctly assessing and treating patients without making a mistake. 

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By taking these two actions, Hathaway can effectively treat Ross and ensure that he is healthy, thus achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
