To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of having money. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to return to the forest after successfully stealing the money.

At this point, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the action that directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of having money.
- **Returning to the forest**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to Bubba's journey after the theft.
