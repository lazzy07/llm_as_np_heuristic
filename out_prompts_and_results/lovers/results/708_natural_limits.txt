In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since Blake has the jewelry, they can take an action to help themselves achieve their goal.

**Action: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.**

This action is necessary because it allows Blake to fulfill their goal of being happy by giving away the jewelry, which Casey wants. In return, Casey is now happy with the jewelry, and Blake can now focus on finding the chocolates, which they believe are in the bathroom.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still not happy because they do not have the jewelry.
- Blake is now happy because they have given away the jewelry, which was not their goal, but they are now free to pursue the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have received the jewelry.

**Final Explanation:**
The only action taken was Blake giving the jewelry to Casey. This action was necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness, as it allowed them to focus on their desire for chocolates, which they believe are in the bathroom.
