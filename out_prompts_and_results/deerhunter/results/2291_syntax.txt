To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba can then return to the forest after obtaining the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story.

The actions taken ensure that Bubba successfully acquires the money by eliminating the bank clerk, who is the only one with money at that moment. Bambi remains alive throughout this sequence, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves to the bank to confront the clerk and get the money.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk, ensuring he can take the money without opposition.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba picks up the money from the bank after the clerk is incapacitated.
4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest with the money.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
