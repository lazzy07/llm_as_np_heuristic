2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to help the Lizard, as she wants to make friends and ensure the Lizard's safety as well. This action, while it angers the Lizard, is necessary for her goal of friendship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - By walking to the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can find a safe place away from the dangers of the surface. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to work together for safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that they are both committed to helping each other. It is essential for achieving their mutual goal of safety and companionship.

5. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have reached the cave, ensuring that they are safe from the eruption.
