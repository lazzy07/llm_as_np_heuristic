To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room C**: This will allow Hathaway to assess and treat Young, who is currently in the admissions room.
2. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room B to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to reach Young and assess their condition.
3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will check Young for symptoms to determine the correct treatment.
4. **Treat Young in Exam Room C**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment to ensure they become healthy.

Now, let's break down the actions:

1. **admit(Hathaway, Young, ExamRoomC)**: This action is necessary to assign Young to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat them. It increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.
   
2. **walk(Hathaway, ExamRoomB, ExamRoomC)**: This action allows Hathaway to move to the room where Young is assigned, enabling the assessment and treatment process.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, ExamRoomC)**: This action is crucial for Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms. Since Young is in the admissions room, we assume they have a symptom that needs to be identified for treatment.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, ExamRoomC)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the correct treatment based on the identified symptoms, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat Young, achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
