Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface due to the impending volcanic eruption. Zoe, wanting to make friends with the Lizard, decides to take a peaceful approach.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. By making peace, they can avoid conflict and work together to ensure their safety.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting. 

In this scenario, Zoe and the Lizard successfully make peace, which allows them to work together to escape the eruption. However, the eruption itself is a significant event that could lead to danger.

The final outcome is that the characters make friends, and the volcano erupts, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
