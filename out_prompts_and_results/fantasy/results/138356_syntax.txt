To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire the treasure and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has a source of happiness. The key to achieving wealth and ensuring he is not hungry lies in acquiring the treasure from the cave.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village where Talia is located. This is necessary because he needs to be in the same location as Talia to maintain their relationship and happiness.

2. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory then travels back to the Cave to collect the treasure. This action is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.

3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the Cave. This is the crucial action that allows Rory to become wealthy.

4. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village with the treasure. This is necessary for him to be with Talia and to ensure he can share his wealth with her.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that he is not currently hungry, but it sets up the next action.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax, who is in the Village, eats Rory. This action is included to show the consequences of Rory's actions, but it does not prevent Rory from achieving his goal of wealth.

After these actions, Rory will have the treasure, which fulfills his goal of being wealthy. Although he is eaten by Gargax, the focus is on the wealth aspect, which is achieved through the acquisition of the treasure.
