Hawkins, eager to claim the treasure for himself, decides to spread a rumor that the treasure is buried on the island. This action is crucial because it will mislead Silver into believing that the treasure is indeed on the island, prompting him to cooperate with Hawkins.

Once the rumor spreads, Silver, believing in the treasure's existence on the island, suggests that they work together to sail a ship from the port to the island. This collaboration is necessary for both characters to reach the treasure's location.

Upon arriving at the island, Hawkins can dig up the treasure. This action is essential as it allows him to physically retrieve the treasure that he desires.

Finally, Hawkins takes the treasure for himself, achieving his goal of possessing it.

1. **Spread a rumor**: Hawkins misleads Silver about the treasure's location, ensuring Silver believes it is on the island.

3. **Dig up the treasure**: Hawkins retrieves the treasure from its buried location.
4. **Take the treasure**: Hawkins claims the treasure, fulfilling his goal.
