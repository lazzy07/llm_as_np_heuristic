To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the bedroom (R12) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the bedroom (R12). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story.

4. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry (I1) in the living room (R22). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but can be seen as a way to share the item with others or to keep it safe.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bedroom (R12) to check on the jewelry (I1) that Alex has just picked up. This action is included to show Blake's concern for Alex's happiness.

6. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey also moves to the bedroom (R12) to see what is happening. This action is included to show Casey's involvement in the situation.

7. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to ensure that Blake is happy, which in turn makes Alex happy as well.

8. **give(C2, I1, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action ensures that Casey is happy, fulfilling the interconnected desires of the characters.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have successfully facilitated the happiness of both Blake and Casey, which aligns with their goal.
