**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   *Explanation:* This action assigns Jones to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess him later. It also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 1.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway checks Ross for symptoms. Since Ross is alive and has unknown symptoms, this assessment is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   *Explanation:* Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This is a critical action to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway checks Young for symptoms. This is necessary to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

**Final Explanation:**
The actions taken ensure that both Ross and Young receive the appropriate treatments based on their symptoms.
