Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she knows Ross's symptoms clearly indicate Flaze. 

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is necessary because it directly addresses Ross's fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. By treating him correctly, Hathaway can ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

After this action, Ross is treated successfully and becomes healthy. 

2. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young, who is still in Admissions. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway needs to determine what they are. This action is necessary to ensure that Young receives the appropriate treatment if needed.

3. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A. This action is necessary to provide Young with a designated space for assessment and potential treatment.

4. Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis with steroids, assuming that Young has the rash symptom that indicates Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
