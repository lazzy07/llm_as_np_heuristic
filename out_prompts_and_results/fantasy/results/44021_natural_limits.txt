To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** 

This action is necessary because Gargax, who is at the cave with Rory, wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Rory, Gargax can fulfill his hunger and, in the process, Rory will die. Since Rory is married to Talia, who is at the village, and Talia's happiness is currently at 0, Rory's death will not directly affect Talia's happiness. However, Rory's wealth is currently 0, and since Gargax has 0 wealth, this action does not directly contribute to Rory's wealth but does fulfill Gargax's desire to not be hungry.

After this action, Rory will be dead, and thus he will not be hungry anymore, achieving his goal of not being hungry. However, Rory's happiness will remain at 0, as he is no longer alive to experience happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Gargax eats Rory"]
}
``` 

This is the shortest story that allows Rory to achieve his goal of not being hungry, even though it results in his death.
