To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B. This action is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the assessment must be done to proceed with treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential for Jones to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

By following these actions, Jones will either be treated successfully or face the consequences of a potential misdiagnosis, but the goal is to ensure he receives the correct treatment.
