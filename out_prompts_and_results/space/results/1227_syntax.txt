To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface, where the volcano is located. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard to the same location as Zoe, allowing for potential interaction.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship from the surface. This action is taken to avoid the danger of the volcano erupting, as the surface is currently dangerous.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the cave from the surface. This action is taken to ensure the Lizard is not on the surface when the volcano erupts.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to initiate the eruption, which will lead to the next action.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. Since Zoe is safe on the ship and the Lizard is in the cave, they both survive, but the eruption signifies the danger of the surface.

6. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard meet again in the cave. They decide to make peace, establishing a friendship. This action is crucial to fulfill the goal of both characters wanting to make friends.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that the volcano erupts, but both characters remain safe. The final action allows them to become friends, achieving their mutual goal.
