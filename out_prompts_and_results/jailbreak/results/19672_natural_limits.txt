**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Roy grips the knife tightly, knowing this is his chance. He quietly drops down from the vent, landing behind the bully. With a swift motion, he plunges the knife into the bully, killing him instantly. 

Roy quickly checks the gym for any signs of guards but finds none. He then takes a moment to catch his breath, feeling a mix of adrenaline and relief. With the bully out of the way, Roy knows he can now escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, which he had hidden in the gym, and heads to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door behind him to ensure no one can follow. He then makes his way to the highway, where he can finally escape the prison.
