To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either has the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, while Bambi is also in the forest. The goal is to have Bubba achieve his desire for money or eliminate Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This aligns with his goal of having money, as he can use Bambi's meat to satisfy his hunger.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary to fulfill the first action. By shooting Bambi, Bubba can then eat her, which will satisfy his hunger.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat her to satisfy his hunger. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to fulfill his immediate need.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of satisfying his hunger, and Bambi is dead. The story ends with Bubba having the meat from Bambi, which can be considered a form of sustenance or "wealth" in a survival context.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba's hunger drives him to consider killing Bambi for food.
- **Shoot Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, which is necessary for Bubba to eat.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, completing his immediate goal.
