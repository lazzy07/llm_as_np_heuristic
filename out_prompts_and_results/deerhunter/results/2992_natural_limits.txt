To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to acquire the money.

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions is the shortest way to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is dead.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
```
