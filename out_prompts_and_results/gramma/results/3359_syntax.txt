To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can obtain the medicine from the merchant and then leave the market without being killed by the guard or the bandit. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to avoid the guard and the bandit. He walks to the crossroads.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary for Tom to escape the immediate danger posed by the guard and the bandit. By moving to the crossroads, he can then safely proceed to the cottage.
- The second action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there.

Since Tom does not have the medicine after the previous events, he cannot take it from the merchant, but he can still reach the cottage. The story ends with Tom at the cottage, even though he does not have the medicine.
