Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant and the bandit. The merchant has the medicine that Tom wants, and the bandit is also at the crossroads, posing a potential threat. 

To achieve his goal of getting the medicine and returning to the cottage, Tom decides to take action against the bandit. He attacks the bandit with the sword, successfully killing her. This action is necessary because it removes the immediate threat and allows Tom to safely acquire the medicine.

After defeating the bandit, Tom loots the bandit's corpse and finds the coins that were in the chest. He then turns to the merchant and asks for the medicine. The merchant, seeing that Tom has defeated the bandit and is now in a position of power, willingly hands over the medicine to him.
