To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the cottage with the medicine. Walking directly to the cottage fulfills his goal.

This action is necessary because it allows Tom to reach his desired location while carrying the medicine he obtained from the merchant. Since he is already armed and has the medicine, there are no other actions required to achieve his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
```
