Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcanic activity. To ensure their safety and health, they decide to take action together.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Since she is not safe on the surface, teleporting to the spaceship is the best option for her health and safety.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard, recognizing the danger of the surface, decides to retreat to the cave, which is a safer location. This action ensures that the Lizard remains healthy and safe as well.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - After ensuring that the Lizard is safe in the cave, Zoe teleports to join her friend. Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, they are friends now, and the focus is on their mutual safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they remain allies, which is essential for their ongoing safety and health.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
