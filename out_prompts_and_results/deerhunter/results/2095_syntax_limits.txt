To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares Bubba to potentially shoot either the bank clerk or Bambi, depending on his next move.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions of the story's ending.

By taking these two actions, we ensure that Bubba has the means to achieve his goal of obtaining money (by potentially stealing from the clerk later) or that Bambi is dead, which also satisfies the ending conditions.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **Loading the rifle** is essential for Bubba to have the capability to shoot. Without this action, he cannot threaten or kill another character.
- **Shooting Bambi** directly fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead, which is one of the two possible endings.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)"
  ]
}
