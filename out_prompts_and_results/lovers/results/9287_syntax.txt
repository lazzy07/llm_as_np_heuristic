To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not yet in any character's possession, and we need to facilitate the necessary actions to get it to Blake.

Here's the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R12) to pick up the chocolates (I2), which are believed to be there.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bedroom.
3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Blake is.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C3), making Blake happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to access the bedroom where the chocolates are believed to be located.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey needs to pick up the chocolates to fulfill Blake's desire for them.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: After picking up the chocolates, Casey must return to the living room to give them to Blake.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: This final action is crucial as it directly results in Blake receiving the chocolates, thus achieving Blake's happiness.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates they wanted.
