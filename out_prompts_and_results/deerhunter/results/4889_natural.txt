Bubba is hungry and wants to have money. Since he has just shot Bambi, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. After eating, he can go to the bank and steal the clerk's money since he has a loaded rifle. This will allow Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat** - This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, allowing him to feel satisfied and ready to pursue his goal of obtaining money.
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank** - After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the clerk's money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, Bubba is no longer hungry and has the money he desires.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat",
    "Bubba eats Bambi",
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger.
