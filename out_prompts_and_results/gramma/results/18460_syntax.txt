To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom will walk directly to the cottage, where he wants to be.

These actions are necessary because Tom needs to move from the market to the cottage, and he cannot do so without first going through the crossroads. The medicine is already in Tom's possession, so he does not need to take any further actions regarding it.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom leaves the market, where he just looted the medicine from the merchant, and heads towards the crossroads. This action is essential for Tom to progress towards his goal of reaching the cottage.
   
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom continues from the crossroads to the cottage. This final step brings him to his desired location, fulfilling his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

At the end of these actions, Tom is at the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.
