### Story Completion

After assessing Young in PatientRoomA, Hathaway realizes that Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). To ensure Young receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis.

Next, Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting there. Hathaway assigns Jones to Exam Room B, where he can be assessed later.
