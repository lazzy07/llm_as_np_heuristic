In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The following actions will be taken to achieve this goal:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will first admit Ross to an exam room (let's say exam room C) and then assess him. This is necessary to determine if Ross has any symptoms that need to be treated.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to increase Hathaway's workload by one, allowing him to assess Ross's condition.

3. **Assess Ross**: After admitting Ross to exam room C, Hathaway will assess him to check for symptoms. This is crucial to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. If he has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients, including Ross, are treated appropriately and achieve their goal of having all patients healthy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan includes the necessary actions to ensure that Hathaway can assess and treat Ross effectively, leading to a healthy outcome for all patients.
