Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship, safe and healthy. She knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface and is not safe. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, so she decides to teleport down to the surface to meet him.

1. **Action: teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to approach the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards making friends.

2. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.
