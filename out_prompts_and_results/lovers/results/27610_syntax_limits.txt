In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the item I3 (the item in the dining room). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake achieving their goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the item I1 (the chocolates) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3 (the flowers) by allowing Alex to be happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they received the chocolates they wanted.
- Blake is happy because they helped Alex achieve happiness.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is designed to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by making Alex happy, which is the core of the story.
