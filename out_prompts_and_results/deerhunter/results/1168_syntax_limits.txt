Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy after shooting Bambi, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows that the bank clerk has money and is still at the bank. 

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank, where he believes he can find the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steals the money from him.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where he can fulfill his greed, and the second action directly results in him acquiring the money he desires.
