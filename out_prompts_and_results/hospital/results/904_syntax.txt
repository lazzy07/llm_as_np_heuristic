To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing Ross's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. This is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to identify his symptoms. This is essential because it allows Hathaway to determine whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is vital for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
