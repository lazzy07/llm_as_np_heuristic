**Action:** Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym, where he confronts the bully. He uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Roy.

**Explanation of the action:**
- Crawling through the vents allows Ernest to bypass the locked gym door and confront the bully directly.
- Killing the bully with the knife removes the immediate danger, ensuring that both he and Roy can live without fear of being threatened.
