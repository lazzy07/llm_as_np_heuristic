To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure both she and the Lizard are safe and healthy while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is erupting, which poses a significant danger to both characters. The best course of action is for Zoe to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is taken to solidify their friendship. Since they are not fighting, this action will help them bond and achieve their goal of making friends.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano.

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace**: This action is crucial as it establishes a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.
- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano erupting. By teleporting to the ship, she ensures her health and safety.
