To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because the merchant needs to sell items and maximize her coins. By moving to the market, she can potentially interact with other characters and sell items.

2. **The hero walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - Tom needs to go to the market to interact with the merchant and acquire the medicine. This is essential for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

3. **The merchant sells the medicine to Tom for the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires. The merchant benefits by gaining a coin, which aligns with her goal of collecting coins without becoming a criminal.

4. **The hero walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - With the medicine in hand, Tom returns to the cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully achieves his goal while allowing the merchant to also benefit from the transaction.
