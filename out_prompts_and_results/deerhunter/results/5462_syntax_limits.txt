After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he has a dead deer, which he can eat to satisfy his hunger. Since he is also greedy and wants money, he decides to go back to the bank to steal from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

By following these actions, Bubba satisfies his hunger and successfully steals money from the bank clerk, achieving his goals of eating and obtaining money.
