In the cave, Rory and Talia are now engaged after Talia accepted Rory's proposal. Rory wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry, while Talia is focused on wealth and happiness. Vince is in the village with some money, and Gargax, the dragon, is also in the cave, eyeing the treasure.

To achieve his goal, Rory needs to ensure he has wealth and is not hungry. The quickest way for Rory to gain wealth is to take the treasure from the cave, as Talia is not interested in it, and Gargax is not currently a threat.

1. **take(Rory, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Rory takes the treasure from the cave, which is unguarded at this moment. This action directly increases Rory's wealth, helping him achieve his goal.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory then travels back to the village with the treasure. This ensures he is away from Gargax and can enjoy his newfound wealth without the threat of being eaten.

With these two actions, Rory successfully achieves his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action ensures Rory is safe and can enjoy his wealth without the threat of Gargax.
