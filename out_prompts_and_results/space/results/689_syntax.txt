Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are currently safe and healthy, but the surface is dangerous. To ensure their safety and to foster friendship, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to move to a safer location and to continue building a friendship with the Lizard.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their friendship in a safer environment. It ensures that both characters are aligned in their goals of being healthy and safe.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action is crucial because it allows her to leave the dangerous surface and ensures her safety.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Surface)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship to join Zoe. This action is important for the Lizard to ensure its safety as well and to continue their friendship.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe and the Lizard make peace again on the spaceship, solidifying their friendship and ensuring that both characters are healthy and safe.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
