To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Given the current situation, Zoe is on the surface and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano is already in a dangerous state, and we can use this to our advantage.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is already implied to have happened, but we will explicitly state it to indicate that the volcano is about to erupt.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This is necessary for them to interact and potentially resolve their conflict.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace, which allows them to become friends. This is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of making friends.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a critical event that will lead to the death of one character. Since Zoe is now in the cave with the Lizard, she is safe, but the Lizard, who is still on the surface, will die.

This sequence of actions ensures that the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Sets the stage for the volcano to erupt, creating a sense of urgency.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Allows Zoe to reach the Lizard, facilitating their interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Resolves their conflict and establishes a friendship, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, leading to the Lizard's death.
