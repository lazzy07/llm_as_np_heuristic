Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway proceeds with the assessment. After assessing Jones, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones actually has Flaze. As a result, Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment, and Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment, and Ross becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
