1. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: This action will make Talia happy, as she is now engaged to Rory, who has proposed to her. This is crucial for her happiness goal.
   
2. **Talia travels to the Village**: After accepting the proposal, Talia needs to travel to the Village to access the Money that Vince has.

3. **Talia takes the Money from Vince**: Since Talia wants to be wealthy, taking the Money from Vince will fulfill this goal.
