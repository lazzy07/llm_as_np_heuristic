To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake in diagnosis. However, assessing Ross is necessary to determine his symptoms. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to understand what treatment Ross needs.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway needs to walk to the admissions room to assess Young. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Assess Young**: Similar to Ross, assessing Young is essential to determine his symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is critical to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young based on his assessment. This is also necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones, who is already in exam room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated and healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: This is necessary to determine his symptoms.
2. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to go to the admissions room to assess Young.
3. **Assess Young**: This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones**: This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
