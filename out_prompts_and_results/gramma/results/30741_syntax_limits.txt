In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant can take advantage of the chaos caused by the Bandit attacking the Guard. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story where the Merchant achieves her goal:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Merchant walks to the Bandit Camp to collect the coins from the chest, as the Bandit is currently preoccupied with the aftermath of the attack on the Guard.

This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to access the coins in the Bandit Camp without engaging in any criminal activity herself. The Bandit is focused on the conflict, providing the Merchant with an opportunity to gather coins without being seen as a criminal.
