Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones and Young, who are both in the admissions room, to assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Young allows Dr. Hathaway to identify his symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway can assign him to an exam room for treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - Assuming Young has Jarkis (the only unknown condition left), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which cures him.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both patients, ensuring they are healthy.
