**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Roy knows he has to act quickly to protect himself and Ernest. He quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen. With a swift motion, he approaches the bully from behind and plunges the knife into him, killing the bully instantly. 

With the threat eliminated, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he needs to get back to Ernest. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. Feeling a surge of adrenaline, he heads back through the vent, making his way to the hallway. Once there, he puts on the civilian clothes and heads outside through the door leading to the highway. 

Roy successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
