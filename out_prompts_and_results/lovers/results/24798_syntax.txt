To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R21). This is necessary because Casey has the jewelry (I1) and needs to be in the same room as Alex to give it to them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where Casey is located (R22). This is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamics of the story.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Blake is located (R22). This action allows Alex to be with both Casey and Blake, enhancing the social aspect of their happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
