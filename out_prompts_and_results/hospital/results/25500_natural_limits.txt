Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway confirms that he has a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, successfully making Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C, as Young is still waiting there. This action is necessary to ensure that Young can be assessed and treated as well, but it is not required for the immediate goal of making Ross healthy.

The actions taken are as follows:
1. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to confirm his symptoms (rash).
2. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, curing him of Jarkis.

These actions are necessary to achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, starting with Ross.
