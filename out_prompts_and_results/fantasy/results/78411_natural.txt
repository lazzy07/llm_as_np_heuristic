To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** (This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is located in the cave.)
2. **Gargax eats Talia.** (This action is necessary to remove Talia from the story, as she cannot achieve her goal of happiness and wealth if she is alive and not in a position to claim her wealth.)
3. **Rory proposes to Talia.** (This action is included to show Rory's desire for happiness, but it becomes irrelevant since Talia is no longer alive.)
4. **Vince takes the money from Talia's dead body.** (This action allows Vince to gain wealth, which is a side effect of Talia's demise.)
5. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's dead body.** (This action allows Gargax to become wealthy, fulfilling his goal.)

In this story, Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy is ultimately not achieved due to her being eaten by Gargax. However, the actions taken by the other characters reflect their desires and the consequences of Talia's choices.
