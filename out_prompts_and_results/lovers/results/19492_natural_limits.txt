In the living room, Casey realizes that Alex has the jewelry they desire. To achieve their goal of happiness, Casey decides to take action. 

Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom, where Blake is. Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the chocolates, which is a lie, but it serves to distract Blake from the fact that Casey wants the jewelry. 

Blake, believing Casey, decides to move to the dining room to get the chocolates, leaving the bathroom empty. 

Meanwhile, Casey returns to the living room and picks up the jewelry that Alex had put down earlier. Now, Casey has the jewelry they wanted, making them happy.
