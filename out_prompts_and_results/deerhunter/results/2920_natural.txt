To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to return to a safe location after obtaining the money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully stolen the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead. The story ends with Bubba having the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the direct action that fulfills Bubba's desire to have money.
- **Returning to the forest**: This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but provides closure to Bubba's journey after achieving his goal.
