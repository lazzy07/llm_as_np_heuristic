**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Young to an exam room. She assigns Young to Exam Room C, increasing her workload to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. She discovers that Ross is experiencing a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Since her workload is still below 3, she correctly identifies the disease. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to check on the remaining patients, ensuring they receive the necessary care.
