**Story Completion:**

After Ross walks into Exam Room A, he finds himself in the presence of Dr. Hathaway, who is currently overwhelmed with a workload of three. Ross knows he needs to be assessed quickly to ensure he receives the right treatment. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. Due to his high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis instead of Flaze. This is a critical moment, as the wrong diagnosis could lead to a fatal outcome.

2. **Treat Ross**: Dr. Hathaway, believing Ross has Jarkis, administers steroids to treat him. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Fortunately, Ross's health is resilient, and he survives the treatment despite it being the wrong one.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After the treatment, Ross walks back to the Admissions room, feeling relieved to be alive, even if he is not fully healthy yet. He knows he will need to follow up with Dr. Hathaway later for the correct treatment.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on a treatment plan. Despite the mistake, it is crucial for the story's progression.
  
- **Treat Ross**: This action is essential as it represents the culmination of the assessment. Even though the treatment is incorrect, it leads to Ross's survival, which aligns with his goal of being alive and healthy.

- **Walk to Admissions**: This action signifies Ross's return to a safe space after the treatment, reinforcing his goal of being alive. It also sets the stage for potential future interactions with Dr. Hathaway for the correct treatment.
