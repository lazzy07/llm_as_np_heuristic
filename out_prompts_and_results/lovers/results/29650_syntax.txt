To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey (C3) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Alex (C1) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want while also ensuring Casey gets something they desire.

2. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: After the trade, Blake (C2) will put down the chocolates (I2) in the room. This action is included to clarify that Blake no longer has the chocolates, which are now with Casey.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex will move to the dining room (R21) to be in a location where they can be happy with the jewelry.

4. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex will pick up the jewelry (I1) that is now in the dining room. This action is crucial as it allows Alex to finally obtain the item they want.

5. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex will move back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake, ensuring that they can share their happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, making them happy.
