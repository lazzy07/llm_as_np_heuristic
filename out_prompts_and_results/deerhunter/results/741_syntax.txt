To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the money is located. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where he can obtain the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one standing between him and the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba returns to the forest with the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank with his prize.

The actions are designed to ensure that Bubba successfully obtains the money while also eliminating any threats (the bank clerk) in the process. Bambi remains alive throughout this sequence, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
