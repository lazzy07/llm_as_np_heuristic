To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia is already engaged to both Rory and Vince, she can leverage her relationships to gain wealth. The key is for Talia to travel to the cave, where the treasure is located, and then marry one of the humans to secure her happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for her to access the treasure, which will help her achieve her goal of wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her wealth.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince in the cave. This action ensures Talia's happiness, as she is now in a committed relationship.

4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia also marries Rory in the cave. This action further solidifies her happiness, as she is now married to both Rory and Vince.

Now, Talia has achieved her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
