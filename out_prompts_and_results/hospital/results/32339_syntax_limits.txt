**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Young is necessary to identify if they have Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics in PatientRoomA**: Assuming Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a fever (Flaze), Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition, ensuring they become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess and admit Jones and Ross, ensuring they receive the necessary care as well.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Young**: This action is essential for Hathaway to determine the correct treatment for Young. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.
  
- **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: This action is critical as it directly treats Young's condition. If Young has Flaze, antibiotics will cure them, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

- **Walk to Admissions**: This action allows Hathaway to continue their work by moving to the admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, ensuring that all patients receive the necessary care.
