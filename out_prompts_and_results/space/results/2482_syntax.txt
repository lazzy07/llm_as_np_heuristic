To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard is already in the cave, and it will walk to the surface. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard to the same location as Zoe, allowing for further interactions.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once the Lizard is on the surface, Zoe and the Lizard can make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where the volcano erupts, leading to a character's death.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since the volcano has erupted, it will kill the Lizard. This action signifies the end of the Lizard's life due to the eruption.

The sequence of actions ensures that both characters achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also making friends. However, the eruption leads to the Lizard's demise, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
