To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R11, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R11) to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to give or receive.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is important because it helps Alex to potentially become happy, which is part of the interconnected happiness of the characters.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R22) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This is necessary for Alex to access the item that Casey wants.

4. **pick_up(C2, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I3) in the bathroom (R22). This is crucial as it allows Alex to have the item that Casey wants.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21) with the jewelry (I3). This is necessary for Alex to give the jewelry to Casey.

6. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R21). This is the final action that ensures Casey receives the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- Casey moves to the dining room to be in a position to interact with Alex.
- Casey gives flowers to Alex to help Alex potentially become happy.
- Alex moves to the bathroom to get the jewelry that Casey wants.
- Alex picks up the jewelry to have it ready for giving.
- Alex returns to the dining room to be with Casey.
- Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.
