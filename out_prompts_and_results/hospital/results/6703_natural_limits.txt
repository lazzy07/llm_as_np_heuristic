Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is already assigned to this room, Hathaway's workload remains manageable at 2. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that he is experiencing a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Ross healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring patient health. 

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young, who is still waiting there. This action is not necessary for the immediate goal but sets up for future patient care.
