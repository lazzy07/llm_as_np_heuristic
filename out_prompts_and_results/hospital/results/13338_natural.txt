**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is currently in Admissions.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B. (This allows Hathaway to assess and treat Young.)
3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B. (Hathaway needs to assess Young in the newly assigned room.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Unknown. (Hathaway needs to determine Young's condition.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. (Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway assumes the worst-case scenario and treats for Jarkis, which is a safe choice as it won't harm Young.)
6. Young becomes healthy. (Hathaway successfully treats Young, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.)
