To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake currently does not have an item, and they want to make Alex happy by ensuring Alex gets the item they want (which is I1, the flowers). 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Blake moves to the dining room (R22)**: This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.
   - Action: `move(C2, R21, R22)`

2. **Blake picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R22)**: Blake needs to pick up the item that Alex wants to make them happy.
   - Action: `pick_up(C2, I1, R22)`

3. **Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
   - Action: `give(C2, I1, C1, R22)`

4. **Blake moves to the living room (R21)**: After giving the flowers to Alex, Blake can move to the living room to be in a different space.
   - Action: `move(C2, R22, R21)`

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Move to R22**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.
- **Pick up I1**: Blake picks up the flowers, which is what Alex wants.
- **Give I1 to C1**: This action makes Alex happy, which is also Blake's goal.
- **Move to R21**: Blake moves to a different room after achieving their goal.

At the end of these actions, Blake is happy because they helped Alex achieve happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C2, R21, R22)",
    "pick_up(C2, I1, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
