After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain some energy. However, he is still focused on his greed and the desire for money. 

Next, Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the bank clerk. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. 

Bubba then steals the money from the bank clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba goes to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the clerk using the threat of his loaded rifle.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger and achieve his goal of acquiring money.
