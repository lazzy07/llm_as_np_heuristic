To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Alex (C1) is not happy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey can trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the flowers (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want while giving Casey an item they desire (the flowers).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will also be happy since they wanted to make Blake happy, and now they have an item to give to Blake.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, making them happy. It also satisfies Casey's desire to make Blake happy by giving them an item.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
