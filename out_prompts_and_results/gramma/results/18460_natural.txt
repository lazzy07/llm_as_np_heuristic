To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is necessary because it alerts the guard to the presence of a criminal (the bandit) in the market, which could lead to the bandit's arrest or death, allowing Tom to safely leave the market.

2. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - The guard, upon being informed of the bandit's presence, will take action to eliminate the threat. This is crucial for Tom's safety and allows him to leave the market without fear of being robbed or attacked.

3. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - With the bandit eliminated, Tom can now safely leave the market and head towards the crossroads.

4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom reaches his destination, the cottage, carrying the medicine he looted from the merchant.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine while eliminating the threat posed by the bandit.
