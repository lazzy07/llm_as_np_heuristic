In this story, Zoe is currently safe aboard her spaceship, while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the surface uninhabitable. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet.

To achieve this, Zoe will teleport back to the surface, which will make the Lizard angry, but it is necessary for her to confront the Lizard and attempt to make peace. The eruption of the volcano will occur shortly after, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface. This action is necessary for her to engage with the Lizard and attempt to make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be friends and safe.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. This action leads to the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface when the eruption occurs.

In this story, Zoe's attempt to make peace with the Lizard is ultimately unsuccessful due to the eruption, but it highlights her intention to connect with the Lizard before the tragic end.
