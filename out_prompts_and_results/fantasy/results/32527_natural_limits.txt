In the cave, Rory, who has just picked up the treasure, realizes that Gargax, the dragon, is also present. Knowing that Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, Rory decides to negotiate with Gargax. Rory offers the treasure in exchange for safety and a promise that Gargax will not eat him. This action ensures that Rory can keep his wealth and avoid hunger, thus achieving his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.

1. **Rory offers the treasure to Gargax**: This action is necessary for Rory to ensure his safety and to satisfy Gargax's desire for wealth, which will prevent Gargax from eating him.
2. **Gargax accepts the treasure**: This action allows Gargax to become wealthy, and in return, Rory is safe and can maintain his happiness and wealth.

With these two actions, Rory successfully achieves his goal.
