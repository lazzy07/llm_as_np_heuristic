To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, but she is not happy. To make Talia happy, we can have her propose to Vince, who is already married to her, and then have Vince accept the proposal. This will increase Talia's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Talia proposes to Vince.** - This action is necessary because Talia needs to express her desire for a deeper connection with Vince, which will lead to her happiness.
