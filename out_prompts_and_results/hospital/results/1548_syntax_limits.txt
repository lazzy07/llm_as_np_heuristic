**Story Completion:**

After assessing Ross in Exam Room A, Hathaway determines that Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by SymptomA (fever). To ensure Ross's health, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address Young, who is currently in Admissions and has not been assessed yet. Since Hathaway's workload is now 1 (after treating Ross), they can safely assess Young without the risk of making a mistake.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C, increasing their workload to 2 again but allowing Young to be treated.

3. **walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Young walks to Exam Room C, where Hathaway can assess and treat them.

4. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young and finds that they are showing symptoms of Jarkis (rash).

5. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Young becomes healthy.

With both Ross and Young treated successfully, Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
