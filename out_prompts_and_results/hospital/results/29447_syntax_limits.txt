In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room B and has a workload of 3. To achieve their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients effectively. 

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room A to assess Ross. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Ross is necessary to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids instead of antibiotics. Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's death, but Hathaway's workload is reduced to 2.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room B. Young is showing symptoms of Flaze (fever).
