In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, and they are currently in the dining room (R21). Casey (C3) has item I1, and they are also in the dining room. Blake (C2) is in the living room (R22) with item I2 (chocolates). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R21). This action is necessary because it directly satisfies Alex's desire for the item they want, thus making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey will be unhappy because they no longer have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake will remain unhappy because they still do not have the item they want.

The story is complete as Alex has achieved their goal of happiness.
