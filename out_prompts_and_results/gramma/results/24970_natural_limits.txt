Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads, aware that the merchant has the medicine he desires. He decides to take action to obtain it. 

Tom approaches the merchant and demands the medicine, threatening her with his sword. The merchant, realizing she is unarmed and cannot defend herself, hands over the medicine to Tom to avoid conflict. 

With the medicine now in his possession, Tom walks back to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of carrying the medicine.
