To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and focus on his next goal, which is to get money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and obtain money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Accomplishes Bubba's goal of getting money by using the threat of his rifle.
