In this story, Zoe is currently on her spaceship, while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous. Since Zoe has made peace with the Lizard, they are not fighting, and their relationship is friendly. However, Zoe's safety is at risk due to the erupting volcano.

To complete the story, Zoe will teleport back to the surface, which will make the Lizard angry, but it is necessary for her to ensure that they can work together to escape the danger posed by the volcano. The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, will likely want to help Zoe, and this action will lead to a stronger bond between them.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports to her ship to assess the situation and prepare for the next action.
2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface, which angers the Lizard but is necessary for them to confront the erupting volcano together.

After Zoe teleports back to the surface, the volcano erupts, and Zoe is caught in the eruption, leading to her demise. However, the Lizard, having witnessed Zoe's bravery and willingness to return to the surface, feels a deep sense of friendship and respect for her. This act of bravery solidifies their bond, even in the face of tragedy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to regroup and prepare for the next steps in the dangerous situation.
- **teleport_from_ship**: This action is crucial as it brings Zoe back to the surface to confront the erupting volcano, despite the risk it poses to her safety. It also serves to strengthen the relationship with the Lizard, as they will face the danger together.
