To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step to increase the Bandit's wealth. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully take the coin without any risk.
- **Walking to Camp**: After acquiring the coin, the Bandit needs to return to her base (the camp) to secure her loot.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.
