To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is crucial because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake and Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action is optional but provides a sense of closure as Alex returns to the dining room.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
