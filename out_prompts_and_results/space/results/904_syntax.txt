Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows that both she and the Lizard need to find safety and establish a friendship to ensure their mutual well-being. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe decides to solidify their friendship with the Lizard. They have already established a positive relationship, and making peace will ensure they can work together to find safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are out of immediate danger.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures they are both in a safe location.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions to move to safety.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
