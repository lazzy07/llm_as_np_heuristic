To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory and the money that Vince possesses. Since Talia is already married to Rory, her happiness is tied to their relationship. However, she also desires wealth. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and/or wealth:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village where Talia and Vince are located. This is necessary because Talia needs to be in the same location as Rory to interact with him and ensure her happiness.

2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial because it allows Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her primary goals.

3. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is included to create a scenario where Vince may be more willing to give up his money or treasure in the future, as he may need to negotiate for food.

4. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave to be closer to the treasure. This is important because she needs to be in the location of the treasure to potentially acquire it.

5. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure. This action directly contributes to her wealth, fulfilling one of her goals.

After these actions, Talia will have both the money and the treasure, making her wealthy. Additionally, since she is married to Rory, she will also be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Brings Rory back to Talia, ensuring their relationship remains strong and Talia's happiness is maintained.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Directly fulfills Talia's desire for wealth by acquiring money.

- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Moves Talia to the location of the treasure, which is essential for her to achieve wealth.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Completes Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.
