**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway proceeds with the assessment. 

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones actually has an unknown condition. However, since Jones is alive, he does not die from the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 2.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is also experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross remains alive but is not treated correctly.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 1.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing an unknown condition, and Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, but Young remains alive.

Despite the mistakes, all patients remain alive, and Dr. Hathaway has done their best to treat them.
