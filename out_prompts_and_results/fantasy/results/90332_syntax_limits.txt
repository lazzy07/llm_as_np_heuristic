To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the most efficient action is for her to take the treasure from Gargax, as it will make her wealthy. Since Gargax is in the cave and Talia is currently in the village, she needs to travel to the cave first. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for her to reach the treasure.
2. **take(Talia, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Talia takes the treasure from Gargax. This action makes Talia wealthy, which is one of her goals.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy, and since she is already in a relationship with Rory (who has accepted her proposal), she will also be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: This action is essential for Talia to access the treasure, which is located in the cave.
- **take(Talia, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.
