To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse**: The bandit takes the medicine from the dead merchant. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal, and the merchant is currently dead, making it possible for the bandit to loot her.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp**: The bandit takes the medicine to her camp, where she can store it or keep it safe. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the medicine she just looted.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads**: The guard moves to the crossroads to investigate the situation after the attack on the merchant. This action is necessary to maintain the guard's role in the story, but it does not directly affect Tom's goal.

4. **The guard reports the bandit's location**: The guard, upon arriving at the crossroads, realizes the bandit is responsible for the merchant's death and reports her location. This action is necessary to ensure that the bandit is recognized as a criminal.

5. **The guard walks to the bandit camp**: The guard moves to the bandit camp to confront the bandit. This action is necessary to bring the bandit to justice, but it does not directly help Tom.

6. **The guard attacks the bandit**: The guard, armed with a sword, attacks the bandit. This action is necessary to eliminate the bandit, who is a criminal.

7. **The guard loots the bandit's corpse**: After defeating the bandit, the guard takes the medicine from her. This action is necessary to retrieve the medicine that Tom needs.

8. **The guard walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads**: The guard returns to the crossroads with the medicine. This action is necessary to bring the medicine back to the crossroads.

9. **The guard gives the medicine to Tom**: The guard hands the medicine over to Tom. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

10. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage**: Finally, Tom walks back to the cottage, now carrying the medicine. This action fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

The sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal while also addressing the actions of the other characters in the story.
