To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room to the living room. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey in the living room. This action is crucial because Casey can then give the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the living room. This action directly fulfills Alex's goal of being happy since they now have the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, and the story will conclude successfully.
