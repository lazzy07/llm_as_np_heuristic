**Story Completion:**

Blake, wanting to be happy and also wanting Alex to be happy, decides to take action. 

1. Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom. (Blake believes the chocolates are in the bathroom and wants to find them.)
2. Blake picks up the chocolates from the bathroom. (This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want.)
3. Blake moves back to the living room. (Blake needs to return to the group to share the chocolates.)
4. Blake gives the chocolates to Alex in the living room. (This action fulfills Blake's goal of making Alex happy, as Alex wants the flowers but is not directly involved in this exchange.)
5. Blake tells Casey that Alex has the flowers. (This is a lie, but it helps to create a distraction and keeps the focus on Alex's supposed happiness.)
6. Blake moves to Casey and gives the jewelry to Casey. (This action fulfills Casey's goal of obtaining the jewelry, making Casey happy.)

At this point, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry, and Alex is still not happy because they do not have the flowers. However, Blake's goal of being happy is achieved.
