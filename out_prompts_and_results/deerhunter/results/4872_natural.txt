To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has it.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk as a threat and to take the money without resistance.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Deciding to steal the money**: This action is crucial as it sets Bubba's intention to take the money from the clerk, which is his goal.
- **Shooting the clerk**: This action is necessary to ensure that the clerk cannot resist or alert anyone else, allowing Bubba to take the money without any consequences.
- **Picking up the money**: This final action is what allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
