To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Rory without the complication of Vince's presence.

2. **Rory gives Talia the treasure**: After Vince is gone, Rory, who is now the only other human left, will give Talia the treasure he picked up. This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.

3. **Talia's happiness increases**: Since Talia is now married to Rory and has received the treasure, her happiness will increase as a result of her relationship and newfound wealth.

4. **Talia's wealth increases**: With the treasure given to her by Rory, Talia's wealth will increase, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action eliminates a competitor for Talia's attention and resources, allowing her to focus on her relationship with Rory.
- **Rory gives Talia the treasure**: This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of wealth, as she now possesses the treasure.
- **Talia's happiness increases**: This reflects the emotional fulfillment Talia gains from her marriage to Rory and the treasure.
- **Talia's wealth increases**: This fulfills Talia's goal of being wealthy.
