3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but allows Alex to be in a common area where they can interact with the other characters.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is included to ensure that Casey is happy as well, which aligns with Alex's goal of wanting Casey to be happy.
