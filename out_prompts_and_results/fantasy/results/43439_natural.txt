To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to leave the cave where he is currently located and go to the village where Talia and Vince are. Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince to access the money.

2. **Rory takes the money from Vince.**  
   - This action allows Rory to acquire the money that Vince has. Since Rory wants to be wealthy, taking the money is essential for achieving this goal.

3. **Rory picks up the treasure from the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to gain additional wealth. The treasure is located in the cave, and since Rory is now in the village, he will need to travel back to the cave to pick it up.

4. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the cave to pick up the treasure, which is crucial for increasing his wealth.

5. **Rory picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, further contributing to his wealth.

6. **Rory becomes happy.**
