To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also essential for Young's recovery.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is currently unassessed.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify his condition.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This is the final step to ensure all patients are healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **Assessing Ross and Young**: These actions are necessary to determine their symptoms and decide on the correct treatment.
- **Treating Ross and Young**: These actions are essential to ensure they recover from their respective diseases.
- **Walking to Admissions and Assessing Jones**: These actions are necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated and becomes healthy.
- **Treating Jones**: This final action is crucial to complete Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment_for_symptom, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, the specific treatments for Ross, Young, and Jones will depend on the symptoms assessed, ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all patients healthy.
