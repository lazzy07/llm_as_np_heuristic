To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is hungry and greedy, and he has a rifle and ammunition. Loading the rifle is necessary for him to threaten the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After loading the rifle, Bubba can shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can go to the forest, where Bambi is located. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but sets up the potential for further actions if needed.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: If Bubba decides to shoot Bambi, he can do so now that he is in the forest. This would fulfill the goal of Bambi being dead.

However, since the goal is already achieved with Bubba having the money, we can stop here.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to prepare to threaten the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his greed by acquiring the money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is optional but allows Bubba to move to another location.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is optional and would fulfill the goal of Bambi being dead.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and if desired, he can also kill Bambi.
