To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax is currently in the Village and needs to travel to the Cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Gargax to access the treasure.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Once Gargax arrives at the Cave, they will pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is already hungry, but this action is included to emphasize that Gargax's hunger is a concern that needs to be addressed after acquiring wealth.

4. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax will then travel back to the Village. This is necessary to be in a location where they can potentially eat or interact with other characters.

5. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax will eat Vince, who is dead. This action allows Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Gargax does not care about the morality of their actions, only about their hunger and wealth.
