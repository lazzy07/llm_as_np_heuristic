To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is hungry but has already shot Bambi, which means he can eat Bambi if he chooses to. However, since his primary goal is to get money, he will focus on that.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to acquire money, and the clerk has it.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is included to address his hunger, which is a secondary goal.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, which he shot earlier. This action satisfies his hunger and is a logical conclusion to the story.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to achieve his primary goal of acquiring money from the clerk.
- **decide_to_eat**: This action indicates Bubba's intention to address his hunger after successfully stealing the money.
- **eat**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger by consuming the deer he shot, providing a satisfying conclusion to the story.
