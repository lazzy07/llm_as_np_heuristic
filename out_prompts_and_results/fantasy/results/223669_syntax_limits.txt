To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is necessary:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is at the cave and hungry for wealth, sees Rory as a potential meal. By eating Rory, Gargax gains wealth (as Rory has no money) and Rory, unfortunately, does not achieve their goal of happiness, wealth, and not being hungry. However, since the goal is to ensure Rory achieves their goal, this action is not suitable.

Instead, we need to focus on Rory's happiness and wealth. Since Rory is currently hungry and has no money, the best action for Rory to achieve their goal is to propose marriage to Talia, who has accepted his proposal. 

However, since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, the next logical step is for Rory to marry Talia, which will make them both happy. 

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action will ensure that Rory is happy because he is now married to Talia, who he loves. Although Rory does not gain wealth directly from this action, he is now in a relationship that could potentially lead to wealth in the future, especially since Talia has treasure.

Thus, the final action that allows Rory to achieve his goal is to marry Talia.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action is necessary because it fulfills Rory's desire for happiness through a loving relationship with Talia. Although it does not directly address his wealth or hunger, it sets the stage for future opportunities for wealth and ensures he is not hungry as he is now in a partnership.
