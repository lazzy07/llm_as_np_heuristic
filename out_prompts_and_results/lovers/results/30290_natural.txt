To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Alex in the living room.**
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**
   - This action is included to allow Casey to be present in the same room as Alex and Blake, which may be relevant for future interactions, even though it does not directly impact Alex's immediate goal.

3. **Casey tells Blake that the jewelry is wanted.**
   - This action is included to create a potential future scenario where Casey can achieve their goal, but it does not affect Alex's current goal.

4. **Blake moves to the dining room.**
   - This action is included to allow Blake to search for the chocolates, which is his goal, but it does not impact Alex's immediate goal.

5. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.**
   - This action is included to allow Casey to achieve their goal in the future, but it does not affect Alex's immediate goal.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers and will be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.
- The subsequent actions are included to maintain the flow of the story and to set up potential future interactions for Blake and Casey, but they do not detract from Alex's goal.
