To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **put_down(C1, I3, R21)**: Alex puts down the flowers (I3) they were holding. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to keep the room organized and allows for a clear focus on the desired item.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with the other characters. This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but helps to maintain social interaction.

5. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn contributes to Alex's happiness.

6. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps Casey achieve their goal.

7. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their happiness.

8. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C3). This action helps Blake achieve their happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, fulfilling their goal.
