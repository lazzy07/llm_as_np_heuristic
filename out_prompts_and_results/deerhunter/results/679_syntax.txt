To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Since he is currently in the forest with a loaded rifle and has just shot Bambi, he can now take the following actions to achieve his goal:

1. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry, and since he has just killed Bambi, he can choose to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain energy for further actions.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which is a necessary step since he is hungry. This action also reinforces his survival instinct.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba decides to go to the bank. He is motivated by his greed and desire for money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba can steal from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action directly helps him achieve his goal of acquiring money.

5. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba's greed drives him to take the money from the clerk.

6. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring money.

The actions are necessary to ensure Bubba's survival (by eating) and to fulfill his greedy desire for money through theft.
