In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the flowers from Casey. 

Here's the action that will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (flowers) while giving Casey an item they might want (jewelry).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and may or may not be happy depending on their desires, but Alex's goal is achieved.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex gets what they want. Since Alex's happiness is the goal, this single action suffices to complete the story.
