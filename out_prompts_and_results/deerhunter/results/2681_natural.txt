To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and the clerk is the only character with money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is a barrier to obtaining the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk without any repercussions.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After the clerk is shot, Bubba can take the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.
