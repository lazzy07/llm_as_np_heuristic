To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the guard is armed and poses a threat to the bandit. By attacking the guard, the bandit can eliminate this threat and potentially loot the guard's sword or any coins he might have.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.** After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit can loot the guard's corpse to take the guard's sword and any coins he may have had. This action helps the bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the coins she has acquired.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. The bandit attacks the guard to eliminate the threat he poses and to potentially loot him.
2. The bandit loots the guard's corpse to acquire his sword and any coins he may have had, increasing her wealth.
3. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp to secure her loot and avoid any further confrontation.
4. The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins stored there.

The actions taken are the most efficient way for the bandit to achieve her goal while navigating the current situation.
