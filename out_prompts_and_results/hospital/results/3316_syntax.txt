To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat Ross and Young, ensuring that all patients are taken care of, but this is not necessary for Jones's goal.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Ross also receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway will treat Ross based on his symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are healthy, but it is not directly related to Jones's goal.

6. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young also receives the correct treatment.

7. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young based on his symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are healthy, but it is not directly related to Jones's goal.

By following these steps, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy, and the other patients will also be taken care of.
