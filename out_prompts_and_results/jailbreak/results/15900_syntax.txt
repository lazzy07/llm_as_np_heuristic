To achieve the goal of either Ernest or Roy overcoming the bully's threats by escaping or getting revenge, we will focus on the actions that lead to a confrontation with the bully and the potential for escape. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**: Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial as it isolates the bully and allows Roy and Ernest to confront him without the risk of him fleeing or getting help.

2. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: With the gym locked, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully. This action is necessary to eliminate the immediate threat posed by the bully, allowing both Roy and Ernest to be safe from his violence.

3. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Gym)**: After killing the bully, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. This action is important as it prepares him for escape, allowing him to blend in and avoid detection.

4. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is the final step in his escape plan, taking him out of the prison environment.

5. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Finally, Roy escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free. This action concludes the story with a successful escape.

The story ends with Roy escaping after overcoming the bully's threats, while Ernest remains in the gym, having survived the encounter but not escaping.
