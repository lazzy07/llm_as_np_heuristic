In the current situation, Casey (C3) is holding the jewelry (I3) and wants to be happy by ensuring Blake (C2) is happy. Blake is currently unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are located in the dining room (R21). 

To achieve Casey's goal of making Blake happy, Casey can give the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R22). This action will not directly make Blake happy, but it will allow Casey to focus on helping Blake get what they want next.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to help Blake, which is their goal.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
