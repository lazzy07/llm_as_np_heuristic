To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the treasure in the cave. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, she can marry him, which will make her happy. Additionally, she can also pick up the treasure in the cave, which will make her wealthy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, which is one of her goals.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action is necessary for Talia to become happy, as she has accepted his proposal.

By performing these two actions, Talia achieves both of her goals: she becomes wealthy by picking up the treasure and becomes happy by marrying Vince.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.
- **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage, as she has already accepted Vince's proposal.
