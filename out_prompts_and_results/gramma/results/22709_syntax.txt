To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Merchant, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk to the Crossroads from the Cottage, bringing the medicine with her. This is necessary because Tom needs to obtain the medicine from the Merchant to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk from the Cottage to the Crossroads. This is necessary for him to be in the same location as the Merchant to acquire the medicine.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Cottage from the Crossroads. This is necessary because Tom needs to be at the Cottage with the medicine.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads back to the Cottage. This is the final step for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the Cottage carrying the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- The Merchant moves to the Crossroads to meet Tom.
- Tom moves to the Crossroads to meet the Merchant.
- The Merchant returns to the Cottage with the medicine.
