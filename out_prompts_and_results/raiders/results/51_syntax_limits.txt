In this story, the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, and the Nazis are dead. The following action will achieve this outcome:

1. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army, believing the Ark is safe, opens it. However, since the Ark is dangerous, this action results in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it.

This action is necessary because it leads to the US Army's demise, ensuring that the Nazis, who are already dead, remain the only group that has faced the consequences of their actions. The US Army's goal of obtaining the Ark is fulfilled, but at a great cost, leading to their downfall.

The final outcome is that the Ark is no longer in the hands of the Nazis, and the US Army, despite their intentions, has also perished, leaving the Ark without a current owner.
