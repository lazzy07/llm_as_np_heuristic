Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. They have already made peace with each other, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals of safety and friendship. 

To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where it is safer from the volcanic activity. This action is necessary to avoid the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave. This action is important for the Lizard to ensure its own safety and to stay close to Zoe, reinforcing their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action can symbolize their commitment to maintaining their friendship in a safe environment. It also emphasizes their mutual goal of being healthy and safe.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport to the spaceship, ensuring her safety away from the erupting volcano. This action is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe.

The Lizard remains on the surface, but it is now safe in the cave, and their friendship is solidified.
