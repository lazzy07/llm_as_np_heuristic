To achieve the goal of the Nazis, which is to become immortal by opening the Ark of the Covenant, the following actions will take place:

1. **take(Nazis, Ark, Jones, Tanis)**: The Nazis have already taken the Ark from Indiana Jones, which allows them to possess the Ark and proceed with their plan.

2. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis will travel back to the USA with the Ark, as they believe they can open it safely there.

3. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: The Nazis will open the Ark in the USA. Since the Ark is not dangerous (as indicated in the current situation), this action will grant them immortality.

The sequence of actions is necessary to ensure that the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality through the Ark. The first action confirms their possession of the Ark, the second action allows them to move to a location where they can safely open it, and the final action is the culmination of their plan to become immortal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
