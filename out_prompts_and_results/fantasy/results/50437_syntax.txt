To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure located in the cave. This action is essential because Talia needs to acquire wealth to fulfill her goal of being wealthy.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

3. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Vince takes the money from himself. This action is included to ensure that Vince has money, which is necessary for the story's context, even though it does not directly affect Talia's goals.

4. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to remove Vince from the story, as his presence is not needed for Talia to achieve her goals. It also aligns with Gargax's desire to not be hungry.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, making her wealthy, and she will be happy due to her marriage to Rory.
