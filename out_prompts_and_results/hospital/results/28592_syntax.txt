To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Ross's condition will help Hathaway decide on the appropriate treatment for him.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment for his symptoms. This is crucial for ensuring Ross's health, which indirectly supports Jones's goal since all patients need to be healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is the final step to ensure that Jones is healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can manage the workload effectively and ensure that both Ross and Jones receive the correct treatments, leading to their health.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:
