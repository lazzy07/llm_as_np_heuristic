1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia needs to go to the cave where Rory is located to interact with him and access the treasure.

2. **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Talia will take the treasure from Rory. This action is crucial because it will make her wealthy, fulfilling one of her goals.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, they can now get married. This will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's other goal of happiness.
