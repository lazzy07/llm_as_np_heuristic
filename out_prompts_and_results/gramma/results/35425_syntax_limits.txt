To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit can take the following action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit can rob Tom, who is currently at the Market and is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying.

This action is necessary because it directly contributes to the bandit's goal of acquiring coins. Since Tom is unarmed, the bandit can successfully rob him without facing any resistance.

After this action, the bandit will have the coins that Tom was carrying, thus achieving her goal.
