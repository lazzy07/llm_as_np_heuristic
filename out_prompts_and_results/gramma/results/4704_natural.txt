The bandit, having successfully looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. The guard, who is armed and aware of the bandit's presence, poses a threat. To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit needs to eliminate the guard.

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the guard is the only character who can pose a threat to the bandit. By attacking, the bandit aims to kill the guard and remove any obstacles to her goal.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.** After successfully killing the guard, the bandit can now loot the guard's body to take the guard's sword and any coins the guard may have. This action helps the bandit increase her wealth and ensures she has a weapon for future encounters.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** With the guard dead and the market now safe, the bandit can return to her camp, where she can store her loot and ensure her safety.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action secures her coins in a safe location, achieving her goal of having as many coins as possible in her possession.

The story concludes with the bandit successfully achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, having eliminated the guard and secured her loot.
