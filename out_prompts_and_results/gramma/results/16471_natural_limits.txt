The bandit, having successfully robbed the hero of their coin, decides to take advantage of the chaos at the market. She approaches the guard, who is still unaware of her criminal activities. The bandit reports her own location to the guard, claiming that she has seen the hero, who is now dead, and that the hero was a criminal. This action diverts the guard's attention away from her, allowing her to keep the hero's coin without fear of being caught. 

With the guard distracted, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the hero's coin in her chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Report the location of the bandit to the guard**: This action is taken by the bandit to mislead the guard and ensure that she is not suspected of any wrongdoing. By claiming to have seen the hero, she deflects attention from herself.
2. **Walk from the market to the bandit camp**: This action allows the bandit to return to her safe haven, where she can secure the coins she has acquired.
