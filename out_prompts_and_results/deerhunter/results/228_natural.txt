Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. He sees Bambi, a deer, and decides to shoot her to eat. This action will satisfy his hunger and allow him to have food. After shooting Bambi, he can eat her, which will also help him regain strength. 

Next, Bubba decides to go to the bank. Since he has the rifle, he can intimidate the bank clerk into giving him the money. He will then steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba shoots Bambi. (Bubba wants to eat, and shooting Bambi allows him to do that.)
2. Bubba eats Bambi. (This action satisfies Bubba's hunger.)
3. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank. (Bubba needs to go to the bank to get money.)
4. Bubba steals the money from the clerk. (Bubba wants to have money, and stealing it from the clerk achieves that goal.)

Now, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and achieved his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba shoots Bambi",
    "Bubba eats Bambi",
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of having money while also addressing his hunger.
