To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy (or both), we can focus on the relationships and the items available in the cave. Talia has two marriage proposals from Vince and Rory, and she can accept one of them to become happy. Additionally, Vince has money, which can contribute to Talia's wealth if they marry.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action makes Talia happy because she is now in a relationship with Rory.
2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village to gather more resources or money, which could help in their future together.
3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia follows Rory to the Village, as they are now a couple and she wants to be with him.
4. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince, who is now vulnerable since he is alone in the Village. This action increases Talia's wealth.
5. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married, solidifying their relationship and ensuring Talia's happiness.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This is crucial for Talia's happiness, as she needs to accept a proposal to become happy.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory's travel to the Village is necessary for him to potentially gather more resources, which could benefit Talia.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia's travel to the Village keeps her with Rory, reinforcing their relationship.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action is essential for Talia to gain wealth, as she takes the money from Vince.
- **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: This final action ensures Talia's happiness through marriage.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
