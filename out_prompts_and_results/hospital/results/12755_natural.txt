Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis, which is incorrect. However, she proceeds to treat him for Jarkis.

2. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway administers steroids to Jones, believing it to be the correct treatment. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment for Jones, who actually has Flaze. As a result, Jones dies.

7. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.
