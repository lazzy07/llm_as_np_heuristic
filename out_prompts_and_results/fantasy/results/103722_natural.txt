To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness or wealth. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, we can leverage their relationships and the existing wealth (money) that Vince possesses. The treasure in the cave is also a potential source of wealth for Talia.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to access the treasure that is located in the cave.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure in the cave.**  
   - By picking up the treasure, Vince can increase his wealth, which can ultimately benefit Talia since they are married.

3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village to share the treasure with Talia.

4. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action directly increases Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

5. **Talia's wealth increases to 1.**  
   - With the treasure given to her, Talia now has wealth, which contributes to her happiness.

6. **Talia's happiness increases to 1.**  
   - With the wealth gained from the treasure, Talia becomes happy.

By following these actions, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy and happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave and picking up the treasure** allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which is essential for increasing Talia's wealth.
- **Returning to the village and giving the treasure to Talia** directly fulfills her desire for wealth, which in turn makes her happy.
