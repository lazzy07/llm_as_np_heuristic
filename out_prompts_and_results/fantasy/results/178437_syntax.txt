To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, who has already proposed to her and is currently in possession of money. The goal is to have Talia marry Vince, which will make her happy, and then she can acquire the money from him, making her wealthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, and they get married. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her first goal of happiness.

2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: After getting married, Talia takes the money from Vince. This action fulfills her second goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness. Since she has accepted Vince's proposal, marrying him is the next logical step to achieve her goal of happiness.

- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth. By taking the money from Vince, she becomes wealthy, which is one of her primary objectives.

With these two actions, Talia achieves both of her goals: she becomes happy through marriage and wealthy by acquiring the money.
