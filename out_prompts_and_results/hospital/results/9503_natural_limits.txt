Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently in Patient Room A assessing Young, who is showing a rash. Since Dr. Hathaway believes Young has Jarkis, the appropriate treatment is steroids. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Young receives the correct treatment and to reduce the workload, Dr. Hathaway decides to first treat Young.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** This action is necessary because Young is showing a rash, which indicates Jarkis. Treating Young with steroids will make Young healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. 

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Young becomes healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat him later.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition. Since Jones is currently in Admissions, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess him to understand his symptoms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** Assuming Jones has a fever (the unknown symptom), this action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, which will make him healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Young and Jones, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Treating Young for Jarkis:** Directly addresses Young's symptoms and ensures he becomes healthy.
- **Admitting Ross to Patient Room B:** Prepares for Ross's assessment and treatment, keeping the workflow organized.
- **Assessing Jones in Patient Room C:** Necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
- **Treating Jones for Flaze:** Ensures that Jones receives the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, leading to his recovery.
