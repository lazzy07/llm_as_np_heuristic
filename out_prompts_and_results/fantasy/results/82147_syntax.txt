To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions that will lead her to acquire the treasure and secure her happiness through marriage. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Talia travels from Cave to Village.**  
   - **Reason:** Talia needs to be in the Village to interact with Vince, who has proposed to her and is currently there.

2. **Talia picks up the Money from Vince.**  
   - **Reason:** Talia needs to acquire wealth, and since Vince has the Money, she must take it from him.

3. **Talia travels from Village to Cave.**  
   - **Reason:** Talia needs to return to the Cave to pick up the Treasure, which is located there.

4. **Talia picks up the Treasure from the Cave.**  
   - **Reason:** Acquiring the Treasure will increase Talia's wealth, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.

5. **Talia travels from Cave to Village.**  
   - **Reason:** Talia needs to return to the Village to finalize her relationship with Vince.

6. **Talia marries Vince in the Village.**  
   - **Reason:** By marrying Vince, Talia will achieve happiness, as she has accepted his proposal.

At the end of these actions, Talia will have both the Money and the Treasure, making her wealthy, and she will also be happy due to her marriage to Vince.
