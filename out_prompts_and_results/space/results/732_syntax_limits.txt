In this story, Zoe and the Lizard have already established a tentative friendship, but the situation on the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have Zoe take a risky action that leads to her demise while also solidifying the bond between her and the Lizard.

1. **Zoe walks from the Surface to the Cave.** This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and communicate her intentions directly, as she believes the Lizard is safe in the cave. It also allows her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for their relationship to develop further.

2. **The volcano erupts.** This action is triggered by the ongoing danger of the environment. Since Zoe is now in the cave with the Lizard, she is safe from the eruption, but the story can imply that the eruption is catastrophic for the surface, leading to Zoe's demise.

By having Zoe walk to the cave, she can express her desire to be friends with the Lizard, and the eruption signifies the danger of the planet, ultimately leading to her death. This creates a poignant ending where Zoe's sacrifice for friendship is highlighted.
