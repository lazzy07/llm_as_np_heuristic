To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.
