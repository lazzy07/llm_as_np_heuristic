To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on the existing proposal from Vince and the potential for marriage, which would increase Talia's happiness. Since Talia is already proposed to by Vince, the next logical step is for her to accept the proposal, leading to their marriage.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:
