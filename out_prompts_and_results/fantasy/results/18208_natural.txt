To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By traveling to the cave, Gargax can access the treasure, which will help him achieve his goal.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from the cave.**  
   - Gargax takes the treasure to increase his wealth. This action is necessary for Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth.

3. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Gargax returns to the village with the treasure, which is important for the next actions involving Rory and Talia.

4. **Gargax eats Talia.**  
   - Gargax eats Talia, which is a necessary action to eliminate her from the story. This allows Rory to be the only human left, thus achieving his goal of not being hungry (as he is now the only human left).

5. **Gargax gives the money to Rory.**  
   - Gargax gives the money to Rory, which increases Rory's wealth and helps him achieve his goal of being wealthy.

6. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the money received from Gargax, Rory achieves happiness, fulfilling his goal.

At the end of these actions, Rory is happy, wealthy, and not hungry, thus achieving his goals.
