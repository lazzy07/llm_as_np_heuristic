To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is hungry and greedy, and he has a rifle and ammunition. Loading the rifle is necessary for him to threaten the bank clerk to get the money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After loading the rifle, Bubba will go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is essential for him to confront the clerk and demand money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba will shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money without resistance.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This is the final step to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully gets the money he desires while also addressing his hunger indirectly by eliminating the clerk, who is the only obstacle to his goal.
