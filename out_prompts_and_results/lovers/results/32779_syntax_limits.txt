In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, while Casey (C3) wants the jewelry (I3) and Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I2). Since Alex is in the same room as Blake and Casey, they can take action to help themselves.

1. **Action: trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)** - Alex trades the flowers (I1) they want with Blake for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is the flowers, while also ensuring that Blake gets the chocolates they want, thus making both characters happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is happy because they have the chocolates.
- Casey is still unhappy because they do not have the jewelry.

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible story that allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
