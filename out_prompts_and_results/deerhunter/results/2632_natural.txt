To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: This is essential for Bubba to interact with the clerk and attempt to take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money, which is the primary objective of the story.
