To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for further interactions if needed.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room (R22). This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for potential future interactions.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by providing them with the item they want.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it allows for potential future interactions.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Similar to the previous move, it allows for potential future interactions.
