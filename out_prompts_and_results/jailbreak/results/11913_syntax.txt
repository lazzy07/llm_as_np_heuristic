After locking the gym door, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to crawl through the vents to reach the highway. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and cannot threaten him while he is in the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, Ernest crawls through the vents and emerges outside on the highway. He takes a moment to ensure no guards are around, then he puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. With the disguise on, he feels a rush of hope and freedom.
