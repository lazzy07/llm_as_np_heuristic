To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to give the chocolates to Blake, which will help Blake become happy.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to trade items.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the jewelry (I1) with Blake. This action is crucial because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry, and it also helps Casey to be happy by giving away the chocolates.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex to give the jewelry.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, and the story will conclude successfully.
