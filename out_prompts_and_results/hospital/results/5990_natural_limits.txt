Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, assesses Ross again to confirm his symptoms. Since Ross is showing a fever, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. After treating Ross, he becomes healthy, reducing Hathaway's workload to 2.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Since Jones is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway will need to assess him to determine the correct treatment. 

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers he has no symptoms of either disease, but he is alive and healthy. This allows Hathaway to keep his workload manageable and ensure that all patients are healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that he has no symptoms of either disease, confirming that he is also alive and healthy.

With all patients healthy, Dr. Hathaway achieves his goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
