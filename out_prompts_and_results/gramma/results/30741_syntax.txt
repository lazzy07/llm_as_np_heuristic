To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially find more opportunities to steal or acquire coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with her sword, robs the Merchant of the coins she is carrying. This action is crucial for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant, now without coins, returns to the Crossroads to regroup and consider her next move.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom, carrying the medicine, moves to the Market, where he can interact with the Merchant and potentially help her.

5. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant uses the coins she just acquired from the Bandit to buy the medicine from Tom. This action allows her to gain value without becoming a criminal.

6. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant returns to the Crossroads with the medicine, having successfully acquired coins and a valuable item.

In this sequence, the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as she only used the coins she obtained from the Bandit to make a legitimate purchase.
