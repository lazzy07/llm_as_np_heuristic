To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC with Jones, they can assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should walk to PatientRoomB to assess Ross. This is important to check Ross's symptoms as well, ensuring that both patients are evaluated.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should walk to the Admissions room to assess Young. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on Ross's symptoms. This is necessary for Ross's health.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on Young's symptoms. This ensures that all patients receive the necessary care.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their recovery.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient**: This is essential to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating each patient**: Administering the correct treatment based on the assessment is crucial for their recovery and aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
