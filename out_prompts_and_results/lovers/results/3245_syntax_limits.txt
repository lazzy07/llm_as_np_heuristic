To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (jewelry). Given the current situation, Alex is in the living room (R22), and Casey is in the dining room (R12) with the jewelry (I1) in their possession. 

The simplest action that can be taken to achieve Alex's goal is for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12).

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the jewelry, which is the only item they want to be happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they now have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey will still be unhappy because they want chocolates (I2), but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this action suffices.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This action allows Casey to transfer the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
