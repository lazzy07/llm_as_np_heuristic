**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy realized that he needed to act quickly to help his friend Ernest. Knowing that the bully was in the gym threatening Ernest, Roy decided to take a risk. He moved through the hallway and crawled through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he found the bully distracted by his threats to Ernest. 

Roy quickly grabbed the knife that was hidden in the kitchen earlier and, with a swift motion, he attacked the bully, killing him before he could react. With the bully out of the way, Roy turned to Ernest, who was shaken but unharmed. 

Together, they decided to escape. Roy put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself. They made their way to the hallway, where they could access the highway. With the bully gone and the threat lifted, they were finally free to leave the prison behind.
