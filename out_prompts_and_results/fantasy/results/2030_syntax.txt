To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness through their relationship. The key to achieving wealth lies in acquiring the money that Vince had before he died.

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory's goal:

1. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary for Rory to become wealthy, as he needs to acquire the money that Vince had.

After this action, Rory will have the money, which fulfills his goal of being wealthy. He is already happy due to his marriage with Talia, and he is not hungry, as indicated in the current situation.

### Explanation of Actions:
