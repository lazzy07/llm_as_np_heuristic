After the U.S. Army takes the Ark from Indiana Jones, they believe it is safe. However, Indiana Jones knows the Ark is dangerous. To ensure the Ark does not fall into the wrong hands again, Indiana Jones decides to warn the U.S. Army about the true nature of the Ark. He travels from the USA to the U.S. Army's location in the USA to inform them.

Upon arriving, Indiana Jones explains that the Ark is dangerous and that they should not open it. The U.S. Army, now aware of the Ark's true nature, decides to secure it in a safe location, ensuring that it remains out of reach of anyone who might want to misuse it, including the Nazis. 

The Nazis, believing they still have a chance to obtain the Ark, remain at Tanis, unaware of their fate. They are dead, and the U.S. Army has the Ark secured.
