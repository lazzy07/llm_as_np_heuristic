To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomB with Jones, the first action will be to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on the assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Next, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room and assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated correctly.

4. **Treat Young based on the assessment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both patients, ensuring that they are healthy.
