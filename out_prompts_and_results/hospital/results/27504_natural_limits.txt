Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. Since both Ross and Young are in admissions and have unknown symptoms, Hathaway first admits Young to Patient Room C to reduce the workload and then assesses both Ross and Young.

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess their conditions properly. It also reduces the workload to 1, preventing any mistakes in diagnosis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is in an exam room, Hathaway can accurately assess him without the risk of making a mistake.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy. If Ross does not have Flaze, he would die, but since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, this is the best course of action.

After these actions, both Ross and Young are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
