To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are evaluated.

4. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

5. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary for Jones's recovery.

6. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also recovers.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and well-being.

### Explanation of Actions:
