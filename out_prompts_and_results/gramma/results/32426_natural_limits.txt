Tom, armed with the guard's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant and the bandit. The merchant has the medicine, which Tom needs to carry back to the cottage. 

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to attack the bandit, who is also armed. Since the bandit is a criminal and poses a threat, Tom uses the guard's sword to attack and kill the bandit. 

After the bandit falls, Tom loots the bandit's sword and then takes the medicine from the merchant, who is not a criminal and is willing to part with it. With the medicine in hand, Tom walks back to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal.
