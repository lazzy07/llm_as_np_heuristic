2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms observed. If Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.
