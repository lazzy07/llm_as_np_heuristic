Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Ross again to confirm his symptoms. Since Ross is showing a fever, Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting there. Hathaway assigns Jones to Patient Room B, where he can be assessed later.
