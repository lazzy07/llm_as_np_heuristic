To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the treasure in the cave. Since Talia is currently in the cave and there is treasure there, we can have her pick it up. This will make her wealthy, which is one of her goals. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

After this action, Talia will have the treasure, which will make her wealthy. Since Talia's happiness is not directly tied to the treasure but rather to her relationships, we can also consider her relationship with Rory and Vince. However, since the goal is to ensure Talia becomes wealthy or happy, the action of picking up the treasure is sufficient to achieve the goal of wealth.

### Explanation of Actions:
