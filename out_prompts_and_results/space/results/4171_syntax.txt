To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on the surface and have made peace, the next step is to ensure they both remain safe from the dangerous environment. The volcano is a threat, so Zoe should teleport back to the spaceship to avoid danger, while the Lizard can remain on the surface.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the cave, which is a safer location on the planet. This action helps the Lizard find a safe place to stay, aligning with its goal of being healthy and safe.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Ship)**: Although they are not fighting, Zoe can still reinforce their friendship by making peace again, ensuring that their relationship remains strong. This action is important for Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

At the end of these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard are safe, and they have established a friendship.
