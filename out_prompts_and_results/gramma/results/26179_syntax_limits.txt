In this story, the Bandit aims to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Given the current situation, the Bandit has already attacked both the Merchant and the Guard, leaving them dead. The Bandit can now loot the items from their corpses and take the coins to the bandit camp.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's sword from her corpse. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to arm herself, which may be useful for future encounters, and it also signifies that the Bandit is taking advantage of her victory.

2. **loot(Bandit, GuardSword, Guard, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the Guard's sword from his corpse. This action further arms the Bandit, ensuring she is well-equipped and solidifying her position as a powerful character in the story.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she now has the coins secured in her possession.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp through these actions.
