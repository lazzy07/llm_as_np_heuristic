To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms as well.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is crucial to determine their symptoms and the correct treatment. Without this step, Hathaway cannot know how to treat them effectively.
- **Treating each patient** with the correct treatment is essential for their recovery. If Hathaway treats them incorrectly, it could lead to their death, which would contradict the goal of making all patients healthy.
