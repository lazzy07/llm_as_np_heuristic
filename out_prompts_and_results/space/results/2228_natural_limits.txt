Zoe, realizing that the surface is now uninhabitable and that the Lizard is at the cave, decides to teleport back to the surface to confront the Lizard. She believes that by doing so, she can communicate and possibly make peace with the Lizard, despite their current enmity. However, as she teleports to the surface, the volcano erupts again, catching her in the eruption.
