To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Hathaway to PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is already in PatientRoomA and Jones is also there, Hathaway can assess Jones's symptoms. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 1.

2. **Assess Hathaway on Jones with SymptomA in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones, who is showing SymptomA. Since Hathaway's workload is still below 3, there is no risk of making a mistake. Hathaway will correctly identify that Jones has SymptomA.

3. **Treat Hathaway on Jones with antibiotics in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze (the disease associated with SymptomA). This will make Jones healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Admit**: This action allows Hathaway to take on Jones as a patient, which is necessary for the assessment and treatment process.
- **Assess**: This action is crucial for determining the correct treatment for Jones based on his symptoms.
- **Treat**: This action is the final step that ensures Jones receives the appropriate treatment, leading to his recovery.

With these actions, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
