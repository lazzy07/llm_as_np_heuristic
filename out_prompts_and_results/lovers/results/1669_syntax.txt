To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation shows that Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3), and Alex is not happy because they want the flowers (I1). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex and the jewelry are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the chocolates, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Casey after receiving the chocolates.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is important because it ensures that Casey is happy with the flowers, which is what they want.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex after receiving the flowers.

6. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) back to Alex for the jewelry (I3). This action ensures that both characters are happy, as Alex now has the jewelry they want, and Casey has the chocolates.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates (I2), which is what they wanted.
