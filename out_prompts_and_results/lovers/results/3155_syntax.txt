To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in R12). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R12) where the item I3 is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C2, I3, R12)**: Casey picks up the item I3. This is essential for Casey to eventually give it to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the item to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the item I3 to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
