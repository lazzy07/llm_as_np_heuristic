To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not yet in anyone's possession, and we need to facilitate a trade or movement to get it to Blake.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to check for the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to find the chocolates, which are believed to be in the bathroom.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates from the bathroom.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to have the chocolates to give them to Blake.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room with the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary to bring the chocolates back to where Blake is located.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.
   - This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation will be:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = C2; at(I2) = C3; at(I3) = C1; happy(C1) = False; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = True; wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3.

Blake is now happy because they have the chocolates they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to go to the bathroom to find the chocolates.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates, which is essential for giving them to Blake.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the dining room to be with Blake.
