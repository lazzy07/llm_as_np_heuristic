Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway is cautious but believes he can identify the issue. After assessing, Hathaway realizes that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C, as Young is still in Admissions and needs to be assigned to a room. After admitting Jones, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B, where Young is also experiencing an unknown condition. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.
