To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially encounter Tom and the Guard.
2. **report(Merchant, spot: Crossroads, place: Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit's location to the Guard, which will help the Merchant avoid any criminal activity and keep her hands clean.
3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit, which will create a distraction.
