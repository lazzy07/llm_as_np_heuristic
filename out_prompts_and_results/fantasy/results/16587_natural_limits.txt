In this story, Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth. The treasure is located in the cave, where Gargax currently resides. To achieve his goal, Gargax needs to obtain the treasure.

1. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.** - Gargax needs to leave the cave to reach the treasure, which is at the cave, but he must first ensure that he can access it without any obstacles. 

2. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Vince is the only human left in the village, and by eating him, Gargax can eliminate any potential threats and then return to the cave to claim the treasure. 

After these actions, Gargax will be able to return to the cave, where the treasure is located, and he will have satisfied his hunger by eating Vince.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the village** allows Gargax to eliminate any potential threats (in this case, Vince) before he can safely return to the cave to claim the treasure.
- **Eating Vince** not only satisfies Gargax's hunger but also ensures that he can return to the cave without any humans left to challenge him.
