To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in PatientRoomA, Hathaway should assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has a fever (indicating Flaze), he will be treated with antibiotics. If he has a rash (indicating Jarkis), he will be treated with steroids. This action is crucial for ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly and achieve their goal of making them healthy.
