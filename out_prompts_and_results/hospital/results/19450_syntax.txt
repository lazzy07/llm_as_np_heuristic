To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Jones is in PatientRoomB, Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway should also assess Young, who is in PatientRoomC, to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, if he is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics to cure him.

5. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is found to have a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway should treat him with steroids to cure him.

6. **Treat Ross with steroids**: If Ross is also found to have a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway should treat him with steroids as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their recovery.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is necessary to identify their symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.
- **Treating Jones with antibiotics** is essential if he has Flaze, as it will make him healthy.
- **Treating Young and Ross with steroids** is essential if they have Jarkis, as it will also make them healthy.
