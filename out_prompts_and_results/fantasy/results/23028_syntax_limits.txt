In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since she is currently in the village and the treasure is in the cave, she must travel to the cave to obtain it.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels from the village to the cave to reach the treasure. This action is necessary because the treasure is not in her current location.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential for her to achieve her goal of becoming wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, which will make her wealthy. Since she is already in a relationship with Vince (who proposed to her), she can also be happy as she has achieved her wealth goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the Cave**: This is the first step for Talia to reach the treasure, which is crucial for her wealth.
