To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal.** (Bubba wants money and the clerk has it.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal:** This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk, as he needs to have a motive to act.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
