To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2), which they want.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to fulfill their own desire, which indirectly helps Alex.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21).
   - This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their happiness.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake.
   - This action is necessary to facilitate interaction between the characters.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2).
   - This action is necessary because Blake wants the chocolates, and by giving them, Casey can help Blake achieve happiness.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I3).
   - This action is necessary for Blake to get the item that Alex wants.

6. **pick_up(C2, I3, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21).
   - This action is necessary for Blake to have the item that Alex desires.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to give the jewelry to Alex.
   - This action is necessary to bring the jewelry back to Alex.

8. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1).
   - This action is the final step that ensures Alex achieves their goal of being happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I2, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C3, I2, C2, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C2, I3, R21)",
    "move(C2, R21, R22)",
    "give(C2, I3, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is carefully chosen to ensure that the characters help each other achieve their goals, ultimately leading to Alex's happiness.
