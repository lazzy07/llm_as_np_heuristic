To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I3 (the flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room to be closer to the item they want (flowers).
2. **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room, fulfilling their desire.
3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room to be with Casey and Blake.
4. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey, making both Alex and Casey happy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Alex to access the flowers, which are located in the dining room.
- **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is the item they want to be happy.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room to share their happiness with Casey and Blake.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: By giving the flowers to Casey, Alex not only achieves their goal of being happy but also ensures Casey is happy, which aligns with Alex's desire for Casey's happiness.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, and Casey is also happy because they received the flowers.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
