To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1) they want.
- Blake (C2) is happy because they have the chocolates (I2) they want.
- Casey (C3) is happy because they have the jewelry (I3) they want.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to receive the jewelry.
2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.
