Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake, but the urgency of the situation compels her to act. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis, which is characterized by a rash. 

2. **Treat Jones with steroids**: Believing Jones has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. However, since Jones does not actually have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway, now with a workload of 2, admits Young to Patient Room B, where he can be assessed next.

4. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. With a reduced workload, she correctly identifies that Young has Flaze due to the fever symptom.

5. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's actions are focused on assessing and treating patients to achieve her goal of ensuring their health. Although she makes a mistake with Jones, she ultimately saves Young, demonstrating her commitment to her patients.
