To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she can acquire. The story will unfold as follows:

1. **Talia travels to the Cave**: Talia is already in the Cave, so this action is not necessary.
2. **Rory eats Talia**: This action is not possible since Talia is alive and Rory is not a dragon.
3. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia**: This has already happened, and Talia accepted the proposal.
4. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia**: This has already happened, but Talia accepted Vince's proposal instead.
5. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax, being a dragon, can eat Rory, which would remove him from the story and allow Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince.
6. **Talia picks up the Treasure from Rory's body**: After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can take the Treasure from Rory's dead body, increasing her wealth.
7. **Talia marries Vince**: Since Talia accepted Vince's proposal, they can now get married, which will make Talia happy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, removing him from the story and allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince.
2. **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Talia takes the Treasure from Rory's body, increasing her wealth.
3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince, achieving her goal of happiness.
