To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the bank and needs to go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially obtain money indirectly by using the rifle.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which is a step towards fulfilling his greed for money, as he can then take Bambi's body to eat or use it for other purposes.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary because it satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a priority for him at this moment.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will return to the bank. This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk while holding the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and greed while also achieving his goal of obtaining money.
