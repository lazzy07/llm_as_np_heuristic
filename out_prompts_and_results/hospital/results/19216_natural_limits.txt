Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Ross and Young, who are both in the admissions room and have unknown symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3, but this is manageable for the next action.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** During the assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. This is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with steroids.** Since Ross has Jarkis, the treatment with steroids will make him healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2 and ensures that Ross is now healthy.

Now, Dr. Hathaway can focus on Young, who is still in admissions with unknown symptoms, but the immediate goal of treating Ross has been achieved.
