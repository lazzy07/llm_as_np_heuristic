To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market to be in a location where she can interact with Tom and the Guard, and also to sell her medicine.

2. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: The Merchant sells the medicine to Tom for the coin he has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without engaging in criminal activity.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant returns to the Crossroads after the transaction, positioning herself to potentially sell more items or interact with other characters.

4. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom moves to the Crossroads, where he can now interact with the Merchant again.

5. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard also moves to the Crossroads, where he can keep an eye on the Merchant and Tom.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully sold the medicine and gained a coin, achieving her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's initial move to the Market allows her to sell the medicine to Tom, which is crucial for her goal.
- The transaction (buying the medicine) is the key action that allows the Merchant to gain a coin legally.
- The subsequent movements to the Crossroads are necessary for the Merchant to maintain her position in the story and interact with other characters without engaging in criminal activity.
