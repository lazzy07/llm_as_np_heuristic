**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him, but he believes Jones is alive. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, thinking he might have Flaze. However, since Jones is actually experiencing Unknown, the treatment fails, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. He admits Ross to Patient Room B. Ross walks from Admissions to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Again, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This treatment fails, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Young. Young is still there, experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, thinking he has Jarkis. This treatment is successful, and Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated one patient, Young, achieving his goal of having at least one patient healthy.
