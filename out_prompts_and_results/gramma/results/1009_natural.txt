**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, believing that the merchant is at the market and wanting to acquire coins, approaches the merchant.
2. The bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine from her.
3. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, carrying the medicine and leaving the market.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Robbing the Merchant:** The bandit takes advantage of the fact that the merchant is unarmed and uses her sword to rob her. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring items (in this case, the medicine) without needing to kill anyone, thus avoiding drawing the guard's attention.
   
2. **Walking to the Bandit Camp:** After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit walks back to her camp. This is necessary for her to secure her loot and ensure she is in a safe location where she can store her items, including the medicine.
