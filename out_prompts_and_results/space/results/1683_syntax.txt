To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Given the current situation, Zoe is on the surface and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and attempt to make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, this action can succeed, allowing them to become friends. This aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. This action will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is on the surface when the eruption occurs.

The final story sequence ensures that the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing for the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard to form before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and initiate a friendship.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for companionship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action leads to the volcano erupting, which results in Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.
