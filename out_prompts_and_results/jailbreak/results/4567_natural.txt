**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest realizes that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He decides to take the following actions:

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to get the knife to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
2. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This gives him a means to protect himself and Roy from the bully.)
3. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (He needs to get closer to the gym where the bully is.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives him a chance to confront the bully safely.)
5. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (He needs to confront the bully without being threatened.)
6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This ensures that both he and Roy are no longer threatened.)

At this point, with the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on escaping with Roy.

7. **Ernest moves back to the hallway.** (He needs to regroup with Roy.)
8. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This will allow him to disguise himself for the escape.)
