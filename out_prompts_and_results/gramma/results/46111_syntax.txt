To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market where Tom and the merchant are located. This is necessary for the bandit to interact with Tom and potentially rob him.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit robs Tom of the coin he has. This action is possible because Tom is not armed with a sword, making him vulnerable to robbery. This allows the bandit to gain a coin.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit returns to the crossroads. This is necessary to move back towards the bandit camp.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store the coins she has acquired. This is the final step to ensure the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the camp.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The bandit starts at the crossroads and moves to the market to confront Tom and the merchant.
- By robbing Tom, the bandit successfully acquires a coin, which contributes to her goal of having coins.
- The bandit then returns to the crossroads and finally to the camp, where she can secure her coins.
