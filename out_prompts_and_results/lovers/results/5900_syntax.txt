To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C2) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21) after receiving the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps to maintain the flow of the story.

4. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) to be with Casey. This action is also not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps to create a sense of closure in the story.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
