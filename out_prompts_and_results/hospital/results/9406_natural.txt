**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and confirms that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, they can correctly identify the disease without making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis, which makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones to an exam room. Dr. Hathaway assigns Jones to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. However, since Jones is alive, Dr. Hathaway can treat Jones with antibiotics, assuming that Jones has Flaze, as it is the only other disease. This treatment is successful, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross to an exam room. Dr. Hathaway assigns Ross to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze as well, and this treatment is successful, making Ross healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
