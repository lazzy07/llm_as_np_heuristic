To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Alex is currently not happy and is in the same room as Casey and Blake, we can utilize the existing items and characters to facilitate this.

Here's the completed story:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex (C1) wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is the item they desire to be happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is also happy because they have traded their chocolates for the flowers, which they believe will make Alex happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness. By trading, both characters can satisfy their desires, leading to a positive outcome for Alex.
