**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Roy knows he has to act quickly to protect himself and Ernest. He quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen. With a swift motion, he approaches the bully from behind and plunges the knife into him, killing the bully instantly. 

With the threat eliminated, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He then quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. Feeling a rush of adrenaline, he makes his way back to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, Roy heads to the exit and steps outside onto the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
