Ernest, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to ensure his survival. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of the situation. The bully, unaware of Ernest's intentions, continues to taunt him from across the room. 

In a swift motion, Ernest lunges at the bully, using the knife to defend himself. The struggle is brief but intense, and in the end, Ernest manages to kill the bully. With the threat eliminated, he takes a moment to catch his breath, knowing he has secured his safety.

Now, with the gym door still locked, Ernest can take a moment to think. He knows he needs to escape. He quickly searches the bully's belongings and finds the pack of cigarettes, which he takes for himself. He then remembers that Roy is still in the cells and needs to be warned about the situation.
