Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling satisfied after his recent actions. He has successfully shot Bambi, and now he has 1 money in his possession. He reflects on his hunger but decides that he can wait a little longer to eat. Bubba believes he is alive, and he is content with what he has. He does not need to return to the bank or take any further actions, as he has already achieved his goal of having 1 money.
