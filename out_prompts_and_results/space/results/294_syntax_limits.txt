Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the danger around her. She knows that to achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, she must act quickly. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe decides to strengthen her bond with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. By making peace, they can both feel safe and healthy, and it opens the door for friendship. This action is crucial as it ensures that they are no longer in conflict and can work together.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they explore the cave together. This action allows them to move to a safer location away from the dangers of the surface, fostering their friendship further.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe reinforces their friendship by making peace again. This solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to keep each other safe and healthy.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
