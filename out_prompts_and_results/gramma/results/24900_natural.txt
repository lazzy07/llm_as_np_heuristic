   - This action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, where he can carry the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- Tom's goal is to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. The first action takes him from the market to the crossroads, which is a necessary step to reach the cottage. The second action takes him directly to the cottage, fulfilling his goal. 

- The merchant, guard, and bandit do not take any actions that interfere with Tom's goal, as they are not in a position to stop him or take the medicine from him. The merchant has the medicine but is not in a position to act against Tom since he is not armed and is not a criminal. The guard is focused on his duty to kill criminals, and the bandit is unaware of Tom's movements.
