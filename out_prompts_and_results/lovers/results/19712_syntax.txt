To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Casey moves from the living room (R11) to the dining room (R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and the item they want (I3).
   
2. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R22)**: This action is important because it communicates Casey's desire directly to Alex, who is currently holding the jewelry.

3. **Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R22)**: This action allows Casey to receive the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

4. **Casey is now happy**: Since Casey has received the jewelry, they are now happy.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **Move**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to communicate and receive the item.
- **Tell**: This action is crucial for informing Alex of Casey's desire for the jewelry, which is necessary for Alex to act.
- **Give**: This action allows the transfer of the jewelry from Alex to Casey, fulfilling Casey's wish and making them happy.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R11, R22)",
    "tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
```
