To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where Tom, the Merchant, and the Guard are located. This is necessary for the Bandit to interact with Tom and potentially rob him.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is carrying the Merchant's coin. This action allows the Bandit to acquire coins without killing Tom, which would be more dangerous given the presence of the Guard.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads. This is a strategic move to get closer to the Bandit Camp where she can store her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit takes the coins from her possession and places them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to reach the Market to interact with Tom.
- Robbing Tom is the quickest way for the Bandit to gain coins without escalating the situation into violence, which could attract the Guard's attention.
- Returning to the Crossroads is necessary to move towards the Bandit Camp, where she can safely store her coins.
- Finally, placing the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp ensures that the Bandit has achieved her goal of having coins secured.
