Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room B with Ross. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess Ross's symptoms first. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.
