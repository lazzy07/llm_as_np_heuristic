To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and wants money, while Bambi is already dead, which means we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba can steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but helps to conclude the story by moving Bubba away from the scene of the crime.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed and achieving the goal of having money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action is included to provide closure to the story, showing Bubba leaving the bank after successfully stealing the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already confirmed dead, satisfying the requirement of the story.
