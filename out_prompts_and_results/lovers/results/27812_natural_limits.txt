In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Blake. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to trade the jewelry they have with Blake for the flowers.

**Action:**
- Alex gives the jewelry to Blake.
- Blake gives the flowers to Alex.

**Explanation:**
1. **Alex gives the jewelry to Blake**: This action is necessary because Alex needs to give Blake something of value (the jewelry) to receive the flowers in return. 
2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex**: This action fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, while Blake has the jewelry and is also happy, as they wanted the jewelry. Casey remains unhappy, but the goal of making Alex happy is achieved.
