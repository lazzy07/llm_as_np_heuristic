To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, he is greedy, and he is hungry. The bank clerk has money, and Bubba has a rifle and ammunition. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it allows him to threaten the bank clerk and take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba decides to eat. This action reflects his hunger and allows him to satisfy that need.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is necessary for him to find a safe place to eat and enjoy his stolen money.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, which fulfills his hunger. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking advantage of the situation in the forest.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to threaten the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Addresses Bubba's hunger.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Moves Bubba to a safe location.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
