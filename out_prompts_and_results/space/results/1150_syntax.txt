To complete the story, Zoe needs to establish a friendship with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy. The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard in the cave and attempts to make peace. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard agrees to walk with Zoe to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters are in the same location and can continue to build their friendship.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe follows the Lizard to the surface. This action is important for maintaining the connection and safety of both characters as they leave the cave.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. However, since both characters are now on the surface together, they can work together to find safety.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, can help each other find a safe place away from the eruption. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures their safety.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain healthy and safe.
