Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially make a friend in the process. She teleports to the cave where the Lizard is located, hoping to communicate and establish a friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and attempt to make peace, as she believes the surface is dangerous and wants to be safe.

Once Zoe arrives at the cave, she finds the Lizard and attempts to communicate.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Since they are not fighting, they can establish a relationship based on mutual understanding and safety.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since Zoe is now safe in the cave with the Lizard, they can both avoid the eruption.

In the end, Zoe and the Lizard become friends, and the volcano erupts, but they are safe together in the cave.
