The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, sees the bandit at the market with the hero's coin. Knowing that the guard is also present and is looking to eliminate criminals, the merchant decides to take advantage of the situation. 

The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is strategic because it not only helps the guard fulfill his goal of eliminating criminals but also allows the merchant to distance herself from any criminal activity. By reporting the bandit, the merchant can maintain her status as a non-criminal while potentially gaining favor with the guard, who may reward her in the future.

As a result of this action, the guard moves to confront the bandit, leading to the bandit's capture or death. The merchant, having successfully navigated the situation, can now safely sell her goods and keep the coins she has earned, thus achieving her goal.
