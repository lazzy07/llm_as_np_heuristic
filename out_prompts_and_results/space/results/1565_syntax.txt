Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment dangerous for both of them. They have already established a friendly relationship, which is crucial for both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

To ensure the Lizard achieves their goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safer location away from the erupting volcano and to be closer to the Lizard, fostering their friendship.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it keeps both characters together in a safer environment, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring their safety.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship. This action is essential as it ensures that both characters are not fighting and can work together to stay safe.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by moving to the cave.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also making friends.
