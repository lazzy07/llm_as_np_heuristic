In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy, and they are currently in the same room as Alex and Blake, who are both unhappy. Since Alex has the flowers (I1) and Blake has the chocolates (I2), Casey can take action to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R12)** - Casey can trade the jewelry they want (I3) with Blake for the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R12). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, which will make them happy.

- Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the jewelry (I3) and will be unhappy.
- Alex will still have the flowers (I1) and will be unhappy.

However, since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.
