Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and is in danger due to the erupting volcano. She knows that to achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, she must ensure its safety first. 

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to walk from the cave to the surface to find the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to help it and potentially make friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe reaches the surface, she finds the Lizard and immediately attempts to make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to escape the danger. This action signifies the urgency of their situation and reinforces the bond they have formed.

By walking to the surface and making peace with the Lizard, Zoe ensures both their safety and the potential for friendship, achieving her goal.
