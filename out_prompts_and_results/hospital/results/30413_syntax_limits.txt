**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A with Ross, who is assigned to this room. Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, he can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to check for symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess and treat Jones and Young, who are waiting there. This action is necessary for Hathaway to continue his goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Ross** allows Hathaway to determine the correct treatment for him, which is essential for his recovery.
- **Treating Ross** with the appropriate medication (antibiotics) directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.
- **Walking to Admissions** is a strategic move to ensure that Hathaway can attend to the other patients, Jones and Young, and continue his mission of ensuring their health.
