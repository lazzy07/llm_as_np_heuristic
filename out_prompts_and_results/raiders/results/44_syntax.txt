To achieve Indiana Jones's goal of ensuring the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, the following actions will take place:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, USA)**: The US Army is already in the USA, so they remain in their location.
2. **give(Jones, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the US Army. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Indiana's goal of having the US Army possess the Ark.

The Nazis are already dead after opening the Ark, and the US Army is alive and present in the USA. Since the Ark is dangerous, Indiana Jones knows that he must ensure it is in the hands of the US Army, who can handle it responsibly.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, USA)**: The US Army is already in the USA, so this action is redundant but confirms their presence.
2. **give(Jones, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the US Army. This is the key action that ensures the Ark is now in the hands of the US Army, achieving Indiana's goal.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome without unnecessary actions.
