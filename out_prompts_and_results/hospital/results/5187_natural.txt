**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Jones to an exam room. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - **Explanation:** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3, but this is acceptable as it allows for all patients to be seen.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.**  
   - **Explanation:** Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who has just been admitted to Patient Room B. This action is essential for determining Jones's symptoms.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - **Explanation:** This assessment is crucial to identify Jones's symptoms, which will guide the treatment. Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the assumption that Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with antibiotics.**  
   - **Explanation:** Given that Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, since Jones is treated with antibiotics, it is assumed that Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's condition as Flaze. This treatment will ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - **Explanation:** Dr. Hathaway needs to return to Patient Room A to assess and treat Ross, who is still waiting for care.

6. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - **Explanation:** This assessment is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which will inform the treatment.

7. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - **Explanation:** Assuming Ross has Flaze, this treatment will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

8. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**  
   - **Explanation:** Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat Young, who is in Patient Room C.

9. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - **Explanation:** This assessment is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

10. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C with steroids.**  
    - **Explanation:** Assuming Young has Jarkis, this treatment will ensure Young becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
