Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is currently in Patient Room C.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.** (This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** (Assuming Jones has a rash, this treatment will ensure that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal.)

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones, and with Ross and Young also being in the system, the likelihood of their treatment can follow suit.
