To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reasons as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment. This ensures Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: Since Jones is still in the admissions room, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room (C) to begin the process of assessment and treatment.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify his condition.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
