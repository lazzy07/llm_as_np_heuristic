**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room B, where Ross is located. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway decides to assess Ross first.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway believes it is essential to check Ross's condition.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect since Ross actually has Flaze. Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's demise.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting. 

4. **Admit and Assess Jones**: Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A and assesses him. Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

In the end, Hathaway has treated one patient correctly, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with their goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: Necessary to determine Ross's condition, even with the risk of misdiagnosis due to workload.
- **Treat Ross**: Although it leads to a negative outcome, it is a necessary action to attempt to help Ross.
- **Walk to Admissions**: This action is required for Hathaway to check on Jones, who is still waiting for treatment.
- **Admit and Assess Jones**: This is crucial to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment for his condition, ultimately achieving Hathaway's goal of having at least one patient healthy.
