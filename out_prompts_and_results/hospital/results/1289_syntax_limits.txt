**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A. Young is in Patient Room C, and both Jones and Ross are in the Admissions room. Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), while Jones and Ross are showing symptoms of Flaze (a fever). 

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Jones, ExamRoomA)**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room A. This action is necessary because it allows Hathaway to assess and treat Jones, who is showing symptoms of Flaze.

2. **Admit(Hathaway, Ross, ExamRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B. This is necessary for the same reason as above, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat Ross.

3. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms, which are necessary for treatment.

4. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, Steroids, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is essential for Young to become healthy.

5. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, ExamRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This ensures that Jones also becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (admitting Jones and Ross) are necessary to ensure that both patients are assigned to exam rooms where they can be assessed and treated.
- The third action (assessing Young) is critical to identify Young's symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered.
- The fourth action (treating Young) is essential for Young to achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
- The fifth action (treating Jones) ensures that another patient is also treated correctly, which reflects Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
