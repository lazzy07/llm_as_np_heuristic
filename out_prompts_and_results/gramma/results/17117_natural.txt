To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the hero, merchant, and guard are located. The bandit needs to be in the same location as the hero to attempt to rob them.

2. **The bandit robs the hero.**  
   - The bandit uses her sword to rob the hero, who is carrying the medicine and the merchant's sword but is not armed with a sword. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the hero, which is a valuable item.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After robbing the hero, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to either stash the medicine or prepare for her next move.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can safely store the medicine and any coins she may have.

5. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having valuable items (the medicine) in her possession at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the hero and rob them. 
- By robbing the hero, the bandit gains the medicine, which is a valuable item that can be used for trade or leverage.
- The bandit then returns to the crossroads and finally to the bandit camp to secure her loot, ensuring that she has achieved her goal of having valuable items in her possession.
