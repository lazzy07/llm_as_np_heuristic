In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) is happy because they have the flowers (I3). Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I2) but does not have them, and they are currently not happy.

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to help Blake achieve their happiness.

2. **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake (C2) in the bathroom (R21). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to fulfill their own desire for happiness by giving Blake the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1), and Blake will also be happy because they received the jewelry (I1) from Alex.
