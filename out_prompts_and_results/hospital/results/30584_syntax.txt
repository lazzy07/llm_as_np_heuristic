To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC, they need to assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway should then assess Young in PatientRoomB. This will help Hathaway identify Young's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: Similarly, after assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This is also necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is currently there. This is important to ensure that all patients are treated and healthy.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
