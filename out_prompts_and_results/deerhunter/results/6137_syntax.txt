To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to return to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to confront Bambi and potentially fulfill his hunger.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the Bank to confront the Clerk and attempt to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba believes the Clerk has money, and he is greedy.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the Clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the Forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the Bank and avoid any potential consequences.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, fulfilling his hunger. This action is included to ensure Bubba's survival and satisfaction after obtaining the money.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
