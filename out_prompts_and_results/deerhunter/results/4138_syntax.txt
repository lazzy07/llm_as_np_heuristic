To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bubba is also hungry, but his primary goal is to get money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money, and he has the means (the loaded rifle) to do so.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy that need.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba uses his rifle to take money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **go**: Bubba moves to a safe location (the house) to secure his stolen money.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger, which is a secondary goal.
- **eat**: Bubba satisfies his hunger by eating Bambi.
