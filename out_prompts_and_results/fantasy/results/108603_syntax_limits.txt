To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)** - Talia travels back to the Village where she can access the Money that Vince has. This action is necessary because Talia currently has no wealth, and her goal is to be wealthy. By traveling to the Village, she can obtain the Money.

After this action, Talia will have the Money, which will contribute to her wealth, thus achieving her goal of being wealthy. Since she is already in a relationship with Vince (who proposed to her), she will also be happy.
