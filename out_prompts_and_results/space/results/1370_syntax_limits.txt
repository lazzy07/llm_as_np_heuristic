In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. Both characters are currently safe but aware of the danger surrounding them. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and one character die, while also ensuring that they become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe will make peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better, which is essential for their safety and friendship.

2. **The volcano will erupt.** This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of having a character die. Since the story's setting indicates that the volcano is dangerous, its eruption will create a life-threatening situation for both characters.

Here’s how the story unfolds:

- Zoe approaches the Lizard and, realizing the imminent danger of the volcano, suggests they work together to stay safe. They agree to make peace, understanding that cooperation is essential for their survival.
- As they are talking, the volcano erupts, and the lava flows towards them. Despite their newfound friendship, they are unable to escape in time, leading to Zoe's demise.
