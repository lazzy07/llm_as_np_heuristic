Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Ross and Young, who are both in the admissions room and need to be assigned to exam rooms for assessment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can now assess him for any symptoms he may have, which is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Dr. Hathaway will need to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Ross has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this treatment will ensure he becomes healthy. If Ross does not have Jarkis, he would die, but since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, this is the best course of action.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, ensuring he is healthy.
