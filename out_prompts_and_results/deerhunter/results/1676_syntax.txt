To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can steal the money from the clerk. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Bubba's greed and allows him to acquire the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is included to signify that Bubba is escaping the scene after committing the robbery and murder.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and since he shot the clerk, the clerk is dead. Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.
