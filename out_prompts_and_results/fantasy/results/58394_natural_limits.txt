After Rory accepts Talia's proposal, he travels from the cave to the village. Upon arriving, he sees Talia with the money. Rory proposes to Talia again, this time expressing his desire for both happiness and wealth. Talia, already married to Rory, accepts the proposal, and they both feel happy. 

This action is included because Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. By proposing again, he reinforces their bond and ensures that both of them are happy together. Since Talia already has the money, Rory's wealth is indirectly increased through their marriage.
