To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides a logical conclusion to the story, showing Bubba's escape after committing the robbery.

The actions are structured to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also potentially leading to Bambi's death if Bubba decides to hunt later, but the primary focus is on Bubba's greed and the immediate outcome of the bank robbery.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate him and gain access to the money. This is a direct action to fulfill Bubba's greed.
   
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba picks up the money, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank, which signifies his escape after the robbery.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
