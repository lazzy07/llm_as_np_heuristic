Zoe, the space explorer, realizes that she needs to establish a connection with the Lizard to ensure both their safety and health. Understanding that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet, she decides to teleport back to the surface to meet the Lizard. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet, where she believes the Lizard is. This action is necessary for her to engage with the Lizard directly.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action allows her to approach the Lizard in a non-threatening manner, showing her intention to communicate rather than fight.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Upon reaching the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it establishes a friendly relationship, aligning with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and make friends.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks out of the cave to join Zoe on the surface. This action signifies the Lizard's acceptance of Zoe's friendship and their mutual goal of safety and health.

Through these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of friendship and safety.
