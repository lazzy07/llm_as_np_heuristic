**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is in Patient Room A and showing a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis, as the rash is a symptom of that disease. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to confirm Ross's symptoms, which are already known to be a rash.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** (This action is necessary to attempt to cure Ross, as he is showing symptoms of Jarkis. However, due to the workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but we will assume Hathaway correctly identifies the disease.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway reduces workload by treating Ross.** (This action is necessary to manage the workload and ensure that Hathaway can continue to help other patients.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.)
6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** (Assuming Young has a fever, this action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.)

By treating both Ross and Young correctly, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
