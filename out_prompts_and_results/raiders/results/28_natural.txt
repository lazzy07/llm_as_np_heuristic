To complete the story, we need to ensure that the U.S. Army ends up with the Ark of the Covenant while the Nazis remain dead. Given the current situation, the U.S. Army believes that the Nazis have the Ark, and since the Nazis are dead, they cannot take any further actions. Indiana Jones is at Tanis and can take actions to help the U.S. Army.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Indiana Jones travels from Tanis to the USA.**  
   - This action is necessary for Indiana to reach the U.S. Army and inform them about the situation with the Ark.

2. **Indiana Jones informs the U.S. Army that the Nazis are dead and that the Ark is dangerous.**  
   - This action is implied as it is necessary for the U.S. Army to understand the true nature of the Ark and that they can safely retrieve it.

3. **The U.S. Army travels to the location where the Nazis are (the USA).**  
   - This action is necessary for the U.S. Army to confront the situation and retrieve the Ark from the Nazis.

4. **The U.S. Army digs up the Ark from the location where the Nazis had it.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that the U.S. Army obtains the Ark.

5. **The U.S. Army takes the Ark back to their base.**  
   - This action is necessary to secure the Ark and ensure it is in their possession.

At the end of these actions, the U.S. Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are confirmed dead.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **Traveling** allows Indiana to reach the U.S. Army and communicate the critical information about the Ark.
- **Informing** the U.S. Army is crucial for them to understand the situation and act accordingly.
- **Traveling** to the location of the Nazis allows the U.S. Army to confront the situation directly.
- **Digging** up the Ark ensures that the U.S. Army retrieves it from the Nazis.
- **Taking** the Ark back to their base secures it under U.S. Army control.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
