To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, she can marry either of them. Marrying Rory or Vince will make her happy, as both have proposed and she has accepted both proposals. However, marrying Vince will also allow her to gain access to the money he possesses, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary because Talia needs to access the treasure to become wealthy.

2. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. This is essential for Talia to become wealthy.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince returns to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for Talia to access the treasure.

4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince marries Talia. This action will make Talia happy, as she has accepted his proposal.

5. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money that Vince has. This will make her wealthy.

By following these actions, Talia will achieve both happiness and wealth.
