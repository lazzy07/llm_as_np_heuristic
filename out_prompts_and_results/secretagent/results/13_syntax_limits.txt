The Secret Agent is determined to eliminate the Mastermind. After picking up the papers and the gun in the lobby, the Secret Agent knows the Mastermind is likely still at the headquarters. The Secret Agent decides to move back to the headquarters to confront the Mastermind.

1. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent moves from the lobby to the headquarters, where the Mastermind is believed to be. This action is necessary to confront the Mastermind directly.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Headquarters)**: Upon arriving at the headquarters, the Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind. This action is the culmination of the Secret Agent's goal to ensure the Mastermind is dead.

With these two actions, the Secret Agent successfully achieves their goal of eliminating the Mastermind.
