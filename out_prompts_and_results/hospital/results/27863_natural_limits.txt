Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Ross, who is currently in Patient Room A and exhibiting a fever, a symptom of the disease Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, they can safely treat Ross without making a mistake. After treating Ross with antibiotics, he becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones and Young, who are both experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Young is in Admissions, Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine the disease and cannot treat him correctly. However, since Ross has already been treated successfully, the goal of having at least one patient healthy is achieved.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to ensure that at least one patient becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
2. **Walk to Admissions**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess the other patients, ensuring that they are also considered for treatment.
3. **Admit Young**: This action is necessary to prepare Young for assessment and potential treatment, even though he cannot be treated correctly at this moment.
