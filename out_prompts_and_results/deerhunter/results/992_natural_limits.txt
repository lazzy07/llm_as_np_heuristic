Bubba, having just shot Bambi, realizes he is still hungry and wants to have money. He decides to go to the bank to confront the clerk. 

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to get the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.)
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and ensures that Bambi is dead, confirming that both conditions of the ending are met.)

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money and Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to interact with the clerk and attempt to obtain the money he desires.
- **Stealing the money** is a direct action that fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money, leveraging the power he has from the rifle.
- **Eating Bambi** not only satisfies Bubba's hunger but also confirms that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second condition of the ending.
