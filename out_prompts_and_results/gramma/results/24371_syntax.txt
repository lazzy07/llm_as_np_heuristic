To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market, where she can potentially confront Tom or the Merchant.

3. **report(Merchant, location(Bandit), Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit's location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is targeted and potentially removed from the scene, which helps the Merchant avoid any criminal activity.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report.

5. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, as she is a criminal. This action will eliminate the Bandit from the story.

6. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit's coins from her corpse, adding to her wealth without committing a crime.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins while remaining a law-abiding citizen. The Bandit is eliminated, and the Merchant benefits from the loot without engaging in any criminal activity herself.
