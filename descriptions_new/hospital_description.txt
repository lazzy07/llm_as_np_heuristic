There are four locations in this story: the hospital admissions room, exam room A, exam room B, and exam room C. There are two kinds of diseases.

Hathaway wants all hospital patients to be healthy. Jones is a hospital patient. Jones wants to be alive and healthy. Ross is a hospital patient. Ross wants to be alive and healthy. Young is a hospital patient. Young wants to be alive and healthy. There are four kinds of actions characters can take in the story. A doctor can admit a patient who is in the admission room by assigning them to an exam room. Admitting a patient to an exam room does not change the patient’s location. Admitting a patient increases the doctor’s workload by one. A character can walk from one room to another. A doctor can assess a patient who is in their assigned exam room to see what symptoms they are showing. If a doctor’s workload is three or more, the doctor may make a mistake and believe the patient has a different disease than what they actually have. A doctor can treat a patient who is in their assigned exam room for a disease. If a doctor treats a patient with the treatment that matches their symptoms, the patient becomes healthy, otherwise the patient dies. Regardless of the outcome, treating a patient reduces the doctor’s workload by one.
