Gargax, feeling hungry and aware that Talia is at the village, decides to take action to achieve his goal of wealth and satiation. He travels from the cave to the village, where he finds Talia. Since Talia is alive and Gargax is hungry, he eats Talia. This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger and, as a result, he also takes possession of Talia's wealth, which is 0, but he is now no longer hungry.

**Explanation of Actions:**

2. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger. Although Talia has no wealth, Gargax's primary goal is to not be hungry, which he achieves by consuming Talia.
