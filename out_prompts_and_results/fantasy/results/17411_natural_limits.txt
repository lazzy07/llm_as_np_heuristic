In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but Talia is unhappy and poor. To achieve her goal of being happy and wealthy, Talia needs to acquire the treasure that Rory has picked up. 

1. **Talia proposes to Rory**: Talia knows that if she can propose to Rory again, it will reaffirm their bond and potentially lead to a situation where they can share the treasure. This action is necessary for Talia to feel a sense of happiness through their relationship.

2. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: Rory accepts Talia's proposal, which makes both of them happy. This action is crucial because it solidifies their relationship and allows Talia to feel fulfilled emotionally.

After these actions, Talia's happiness increases, and while she does not directly acquire wealth from the treasure, the emotional fulfillment from her relationship with Rory is a step towards her overall goal of happiness.
