**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, Ernest is in the hallway, aware that Roy is in the gym and that the bully is in the cell block. Ernest knows that Roy has been threatened by the bully and that they both need to find a way to escape or confront the bully.

1. **Action: lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**  
   Roy decides to lock the gym door while he is inside. This action prevents the bully from entering the gym and gives Roy a moment to think about his next move without the immediate threat of the bully. 

2. **Action: vent(Roy, Highway)**  
   After locking the gym, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action allows him to escape the immediate danger posed by the bully and gives him a chance to get away from the prison.

3. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**  
   Once on the highway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. This action disguises him, making it easier for him to blend in and escape from the prison without being recognized.

At this point, Roy has successfully escaped the prison, overcoming the bully's threats without having to confront him directly. Ernest, however, remains in the hallway, still threatened by the bully, and his fate is left uncertain.
