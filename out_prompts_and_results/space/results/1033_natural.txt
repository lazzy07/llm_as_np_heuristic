Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make a connection with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. Since they are not currently fighting, Zoe decides to take a peaceful approach.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and healthy. By making peace, they can work together to escape the danger of the erupting volcano.

2. **The volcano erupts.** This event is inevitable given the current situation. The eruption poses a threat to both characters, but since they have made peace, they can now focus on escaping together.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure their safety from the eruption. Since Zoe is the captain of the spaceship, she can teleport them both, and the Lizard will not be angry because they are now friends.

In this sequence, Zoe and the Lizard successfully avoid the danger of the volcano while forming a friendship that aligns with their goals of being healthy and safe.
