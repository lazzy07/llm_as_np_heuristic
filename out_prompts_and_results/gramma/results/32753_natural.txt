To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse.** 
   - This action is necessary because the merchant is dead and has the medicine, which the bandit can take. The bandit is already armed and can loot the merchant without any risk.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location, the bandit camp, where she can store her coins.

3. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that the bandit has the medicine secured in her camp, which is part of her goal of carrying as many items as possible.

The final story is as follows:

- The bandit, after attacking the guard and the merchant, loots the merchant's corpse to take the medicine. With the medicine in hand, she then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the medicine in her chest, achieving her goal of having valuable items secured.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "The bandit loots the merchant's corpse.",
    "The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.",
    "The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal effectively and efficiently.
