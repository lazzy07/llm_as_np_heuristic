To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation carefully. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to reach the crossroads, which is the only path available to him from his current location.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom can then walk to the cottage, which is his ultimate destination.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage while carrying the medicine he purchased. The other characters (the guard and the bandit) are not directly involved in Tom's goal, and their actions do not impede Tom's progress since he is not in immediate danger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market, where he is currently located, and move towards the crossroads, which is a necessary step to reach the cottage.
  
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to finally reach his goal of being at the cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom achieves his goal in the shortest possible way without unnecessary actions or complications.
