Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Since the surface is dangerous, teleporting to the spaceship will protect her from the volcanic eruption.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure they can escape together. This action is important for maintaining their friendship and working together to find safety.

3. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - Zoe leads the Lizard to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps both characters find a secure place and reinforces their bond as they work together.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action emphasizes their commitment to supporting each other in the face of danger. It solidifies their relationship and ensures they will work together to stay safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave until the eruption is over.** - This action is implied as they remain in the cave, ensuring they are safe from the eruption. It allows them to recover and plan their next steps together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard. They both find safety in the cave, away from the erupting surface, and their friendship is strengthened through their shared experience.
