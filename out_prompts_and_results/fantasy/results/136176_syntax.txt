To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory is in the Cave where the Treasure is located. By picking up the Treasure, Rory increases their wealth, which is essential for achieving their goal of being wealthy.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the Treasure, Rory will travel back to the Village. This is necessary because Rory needs to be in the Village to interact with Vince, who has the Money.

3. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory will take the Money from Vince. This action is crucial because it allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of their primary goals.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Since Rory has already proposed to Talia and she accepted, they can now get married. This action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory collects the Treasure to increase wealth.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory moves to the Village to interact with Vince.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes Money from Vince to achieve wealth.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia, achieving happiness.
