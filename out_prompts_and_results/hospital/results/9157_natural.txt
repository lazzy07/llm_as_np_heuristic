**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose them, but their workload is still manageable. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones from Admissions to Patient Room B. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3, but they proceed to assess Jones in Patient Room B. Jones is also experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the increased workload. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones does not have Jarkis. As a result, Jones dies. 

Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross from Admissions to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A, who is also experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the workload. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross does not have Flaze. As a result, Ross dies. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to assess Young again. Young is still experiencing Unknown, but Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing they have Flaze. Young survives and becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young, achieving their goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
