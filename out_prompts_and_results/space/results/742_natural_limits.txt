Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who is still on the surface and feels abandoned. The Lizard, wanting to protect the surface and its inhabitants, becomes distressed and begins to feel isolated. 

To resolve the tension, Zoe, from the safety of her spaceship, uses her communication device to reach out to the Lizard. She expresses her concern for the Lizard's safety and suggests they work together to find a solution. The Lizard, feeling appreciated and understood, agrees to join Zoe in her spaceship, where they can both be safe and continue their friendship.

In this scenario, the actions taken are:
1. Zoe teleports to the spaceship from the surface, which makes the Lizard angry but ensures her safety.
2. Zoe communicates with the Lizard, leading to a resolution of their conflict and solidifying their friendship.

The story ends with both characters safe and friends, while the volcano erupts on the surface, demonstrating the danger of the environment they were in.
