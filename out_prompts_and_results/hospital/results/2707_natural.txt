**Story Completion:**

1. **Jones walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Jones to be assessed by Dr. Hathaway, as he is currently in the Admissions room and needs to be in the assigned exam room to receive treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but this is the only way to proceed.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's symptoms as Flaze (despite the risk of confusion due to workload), this treatment will cure Jones, allowing him to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is focused on moving Jones from the Admissions room to the exam room where he can be assessed and treated. The assessment is crucial to identify the correct disease, and the treatment is necessary to ensure Jones's health. The sequence is designed to minimize the risk of error while ensuring Jones receives the appropriate care.
