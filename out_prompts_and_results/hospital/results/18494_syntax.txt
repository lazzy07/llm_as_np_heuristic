To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, ensuring that Young's health is prioritized first.
