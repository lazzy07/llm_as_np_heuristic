In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (jewelry), and Blake currently has it. Casey (C3) is already happy with item I3 (flowers). 

To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, Blake can give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action will make Alex happy, which in turn fulfills Blake's desire to see Alex happy. 

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they receive the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) is also happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the flowers (I3).

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy by ensuring Alex is happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
