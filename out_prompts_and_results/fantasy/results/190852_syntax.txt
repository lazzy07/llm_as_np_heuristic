To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to gain wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness through their relationship. The key to Rory's wealth lies in the treasure located in the cave, which Talia is currently at.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave (Rory)**: Rory needs to go to the cave where Talia and the treasure are located. This action is necessary for him to access the treasure.

2. **Pickup Treasure (Rory)**: Once Rory arrives at the cave, he can pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Rory to increase his wealth.

3. **Travel from Cave to Village (Rory)**: After picking up the treasure, Rory will travel back to the village. This action is necessary for him to be in a safe location with the treasure.

4. **Pickup Money (Vince)**: Since Vince is at the cave and has the money, Rory can take the money from Vince. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

5. **Travel from Village to Cave (Rory)**: Rory will return to the cave to ensure he is in the same location as Talia and Vince.

6. **Eat (Gargax, Vince)**: Gargax, who is also in the cave, will eat Vince. This action is necessary to remove Vince from the story, allowing Rory to have the treasure and money without any competition.

7. **Final State**: Rory is now wealthy (having both the treasure and money) and happy (being married to Talia). He is not hungry since he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)",
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "take(Rory, Money, Vince, Cave)",
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory needs to be where the treasure is.
2. **Pickup Treasure**: This is the key action for Rory to gain wealth.
3. **Travel from Cave to Village**: Rory needs to return to a safe location with the treasure.
4. **Take Money from Vince**: This action allows Rory to gain additional wealth.
5. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory returns to the cave to be with Talia and ensure he has everything he needs.
6. **Eat Vince**: Gargax removes Vince from the story, ensuring Rory's wealth is uncontested.

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goals effectively and efficiently.
