To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake, who are both in the living room.

2. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey**: Since Blake wants Alex to be happy and knows that Alex wants the flowers (I1), Blake can give the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire for happiness.

3. **Casey is now happy**: With the jewelry in hand, Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **Move (C3, R12, R22)**: This action allows Casey to be in the same room as the other characters, which is essential for interaction.
- **Give (B, I3, C3, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R12, R22)",
    "give(B, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness in the shortest possible way.
