In the cave, Talia, who has the treasure, is married to both Rory and Vince. Rory, who is also in the cave, wants to be happy and wealthy, while Vince, who is at the village, has the money but is not present. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and believes that Talia has the treasure.

To achieve Talia's happiness or wealth, the following actions take place:

1. Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Talia, who is at the cave. This action is necessary because Gargax wants to satisfy his hunger, and by eating Talia, he can potentially take the treasure she possesses. However, this action will lead to Talia's death, which will allow Gargax to take the treasure and wealth.

2. Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's dead body. This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth, as he now possesses the treasure.

After these actions, Talia is no longer alive, but she has achieved her goal of wealth through the treasure she possessed, which Gargax now has. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Talia**: This action fulfills Gargax's need to not be hungry and allows him to take the treasure, which is a form of wealth.
- **Gargax takes the treasure**: This action ensures that Gargax achieves his goal of wealth, which indirectly fulfills Talia's goal of being wealthy through the treasure she had.
