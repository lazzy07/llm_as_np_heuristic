Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to warn the Lizard about the impending eruption. However, this action angers the Lizard, who sees Zoe's teleportation as a threat. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to warn the Lizard about the eruption, despite the risk of angering the Lizard.)
   
Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and attempts to communicate. The Lizard, feeling threatened, prepares to fight.

2. **Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard.** (Zoe wants to be friends and believes that warning the Lizard is a step towards that goal.)

The Lizard, still on edge, is hesitant but ultimately decides to listen to Zoe. As they converse, the ground begins to shake, and the volcano starts to erupt.

3. **The volcano erupts.** (This is a critical event that adds urgency to their situation and forces them to work together.)

In the chaos, Zoe and the Lizard realize they need to cooperate to survive. They both agree to help each other escape the danger.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** (This action solidifies their friendship and mutual goal of survival.)

As they work together, they manage to escape the immediate danger of the eruption, but the Lizard is injured in the process.
