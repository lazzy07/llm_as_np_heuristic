Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the danger surrounding them due to the erupting volcano. Realizing that they need to find safety, Zoe suggests they work together to find a safe place. The Lizard, feeling a sense of camaraderie, agrees. They decide to walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting surface.

**Action: Zoe and the Lizard walk from the surface to the cave.**

This action is necessary because it allows both characters to escape the dangerous surface and find safety together in the cave. By walking together, they reinforce their friendship and mutual goal of being healthy and safe.

In the cave, they can discuss their experiences and further strengthen their bond, ensuring that both achieve their goals of safety and friendship.
