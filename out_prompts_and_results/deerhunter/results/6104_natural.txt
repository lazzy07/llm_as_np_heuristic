To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling hungry but satisfied with the money he has. He looks at the rifle in his hands, knowing he has successfully stolen it from the bank clerk. He glances at Bambi, who is no longer alive, and feels a sense of accomplishment. Bubba decides to take a moment to rest and enjoy his victory, knowing he has what he wanted: 1 money.
