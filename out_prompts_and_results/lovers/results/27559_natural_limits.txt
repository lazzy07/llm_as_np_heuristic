In the dining room, Alex sees the chocolates and realizes that Casey is in the same room. Alex decides to tell Casey that Blake wants the flowers, hoping to create a distraction. 

**Action:**
1. Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the flowers.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it misleads Casey into thinking that Blake is interested in the flowers, which are currently in the living room. This could prompt Casey to move to the living room to find the flowers, allowing Alex to pick up the chocolates without interference.

After this action, Casey, believing that Blake wants the flowers, moves to the living room to find them. This leaves Alex alone in the dining room with the chocolates, allowing Alex to pick them up and achieve their goal of happiness.
