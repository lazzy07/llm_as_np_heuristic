**Story Completion:**

Ernest is on the highway, having just crawled through the vents. He has the civilian clothes and the knife with him. He knows that he needs to disguise himself to escape the prison safely. 

1. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Highway)**: Ernest puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This is necessary for him to avoid being recognized as a prisoner when he attempts to escape.

2. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: After disguising himself, Ernest makes his way to the edge of the highway and successfully escapes from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free.

At this point, Ernest has achieved his goal of escaping the prison, while Roy remains in the cell block, still threatened by the bully. However, since the story focuses on Ernest's success, we conclude here.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action, disguising himself, is crucial because without the civilian clothes, Ernest would be easily recognized as a prisoner and could be captured by the guards.
- The second action, escaping, is the ultimate goal for Ernest, allowing him to leave the prison and ensure his survival.
