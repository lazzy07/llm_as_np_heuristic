To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her current situation and the available actions. Talia currently has money and is in the cave, while Rory is in the village and has proposed to her. The treasure is also in the cave, which Talia can pick up. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.
   
2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village where Rory is located. This is necessary for her to interact with Rory and potentially accept his proposal.

3. **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

At the end of these actions, Talia will have both wealth (from the treasure and money) and happiness (from marrying Rory).

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **pickup**: This action is essential for Talia to increase her wealth, which is one of her primary goals.
- **travel**: Talia needs to move to Rory's location to accept his proposal and achieve happiness.
- **accept**: Accepting the proposal is crucial for Talia to become happy, as it fulfills her emotional goal.
- **marry**: This finalizes the relationship and ensures both characters are happy, completing Talia's objectives.
