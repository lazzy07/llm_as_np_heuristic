**Story Completion:**

1. **Casey picks up the flowers.** (Casey is in the bathroom with the flowers, so they can pick them up.)
2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.** (Casey wants Alex to be happy, and since Alex wants the flowers, this action helps both characters.)
3. **Alex is now happy.** (Alex has the flowers, which is what they wanted.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Casey picks up the flowers.** - This action is necessary because Casey is the only character with the flowers, and they need to be picked up to be given to Alex.
2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.** - This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy. Since Casey also wants to make Alex happy, this action aligns with both characters' goals.
