In the current situation, Casey is the only character who is happy, as they have the item they want (I3). However, Alex and Blake are not happy because they do not have the items they want (I1 and I2, respectively). To ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Blake to be happy, we can have Casey take a simple action.

**Action:**
1. **move(C3, R22, R21)** - Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the item they want (I2) is located.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it allows Casey to access the item they want (I2) in the dining room. By moving to the dining room, Casey can potentially help Blake achieve happiness by obtaining the item Blake wants.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey is now in the dining room (R21) and can pick up the item they want (I2) in the next turn, which will make Blake happy as well.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["move(C3, R22, R21)"]
}
```
