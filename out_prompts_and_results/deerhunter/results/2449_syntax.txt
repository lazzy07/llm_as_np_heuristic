To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money, which is his primary goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the bank after committing the theft.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba, now having achieved his goal of obtaining money, will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank to confront the clerk again. This action is necessary to ensure that he can take further actions if needed, but it is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal of obtaining money.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If Bubba feels threatened or if the clerk tries to stop him, he may shoot the clerk. This action is not necessary for achieving his goal of obtaining money but could be a precautionary measure to ensure his safety.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using his rifle.
2. He then goes back to the forest to escape.
3. Bubba decides to eat to satisfy his hunger.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:
