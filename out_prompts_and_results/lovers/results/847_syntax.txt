To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want. In this case, Blake wants the chocolates (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not currently held by any character, and we need to ensure that Blake can obtain it.

Here's the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **Blake moves to the dining room (R12)**: This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the item they want (I2) to pick it up.
   
   - Action: `move(C2, R22, R12)`

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R12)**: This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.
   
   - Action: `pick_up(C2, I2, R12)`

3. **Blake moves back to the living room (R22)**: This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but can be included to show that Blake is returning to the group after obtaining what they want.
   
   - Action: `move(C2, R12, R22)`

Now, Blake has the chocolates, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Move to the dining room**: Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.
- **Pick up the chocolates**: This is the key action that fulfills Blake's desire and makes them happy.
