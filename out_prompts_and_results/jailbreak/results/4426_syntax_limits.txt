**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened. To ensure his safety and to achieve his goal of being alive and having a pack of cigarettes, he decides to take a bold step. 

Ernest locks the gym door while the bully is inside, preventing him from coming out and threatening him or Roy. This action gives Ernest a sense of security, as the bully can no longer reach him. 

With the bully locked away, Ernest can now focus on his next move. He crawls through the vents to the highway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. Disguised and free from the threat of the bully, Ernest successfully escapes from the prison.
