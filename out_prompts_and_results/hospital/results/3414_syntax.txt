To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Admissions and assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their conditions.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also receives the necessary care.
