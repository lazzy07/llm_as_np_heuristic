To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the jewelry (I3) that they want. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry.** (This is a necessary action to communicate their desire.)
   - Action: `tell(C3, C1, I3, R12)`

2. **Alex picks up the jewelry from the bedroom.** (Alex needs to obtain the item that Casey wants.)
   - Action: `pick_up(C1, I3, R12)`

3. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.** (This action directly fulfills Casey's desire.)
   - Action: `give(C1, I3, C3, R12)`

4. **Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.** (This completes the goal of making Casey happy.)

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Tell Action:** Casey communicates their desire for the jewelry to Alex, which is essential for Alex to understand what Casey wants.
- **Pick Up Action:** Alex retrieves the jewelry from the bedroom, which is necessary for fulfilling Casey's wish.
- **Give Action:** Alex hands over the jewelry to Casey, directly achieving Casey's goal of happiness.
