Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A with Ross. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Ross. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a chance of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to gather information.

2. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Assuming that Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the workload), Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. This action is crucial to attempt to make Ross healthy.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room, allowing for future assessment and treatment.

4. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones. This action is necessary to check on Jones, who is currently in Admissions and has unknown symptoms.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This action is essential to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, allowing for appropriate treatment.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Jones are assessed and treated, ultimately achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
