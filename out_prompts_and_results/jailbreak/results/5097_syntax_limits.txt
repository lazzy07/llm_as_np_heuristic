**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has a plan to get revenge and secure his safety. He quickly moves to the kitchen to grab the knife, knowing that it will give him the upper hand against the bully. 

Once he has the knife, he heads to the gym. He locks the gym door behind him to ensure that no one can interrupt what he is about to do. With the bully trapped inside, Ernest confronts him. The bully, taken by surprise, tries to threaten Ernest, but Ernest is no longer afraid. He uses the knife to kill the bully, finally freeing himself and Roy from the constant threat.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole earlier from the laundry, disguising himself. He then makes his way to the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once there, he puts on the civilian clothes and successfully escapes, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
