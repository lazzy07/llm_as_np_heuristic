To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to reach the crossroads, which is the path to the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom will walk to the cottage, where he wants to be.
3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The merchant will walk back to the market, as she prefers to be there.
4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The guard will walk to the crossroads to keep an eye on the area.
5. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit will also walk to the crossroads, likely to follow the merchant or look for opportunities.

Now, Tom is at the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.
