**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's health condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young also receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Young with steroids if he shows symptoms of Jarkis. This ensures that Young's health is also restored.
