To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Young has in order to treat them correctly.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Jones is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat Jones with steroids. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms, leading to their health.
