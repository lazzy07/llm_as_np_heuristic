To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent needs to find the gun and then kill the mastermind. The following actions will accomplish this:

1. **Find the Gun**: The secret agent is currently in the office, and the gun is not yet accounted for. The agent needs to find the gun to carry out the plan. 
   - Action: `find(SecretAgent, Gun, Office)`

2. **Move to the Lobby**: After finding the gun, the secret agent needs to move to the lobby where the mastermind is believed to be. The agent can only move to the lobby while holding the papers, so this action is not necessary in this case.
   - Action: `move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)`

3. **Kill the Mastermind**: Now that the secret agent is in the lobby with the gun, they can kill the mastermind.
   - Action: `kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)`

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Find the Gun**: The secret agent searches the office and discovers the gun. This is necessary because the agent needs a weapon to achieve their goal of killing the mastermind.
   
2. **Move to the Lobby**: The secret agent moves to the lobby, where the mastermind is located. This is essential for the agent to confront the mastermind.

3. **Kill the Mastermind**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the lobby. This is the final action that fulfills the agent's goal.
