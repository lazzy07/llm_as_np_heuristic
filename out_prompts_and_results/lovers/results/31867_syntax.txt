To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R21). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to position Blake in a different room for potential future interactions.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22). This action is also not necessary for Blake's happiness but allows Alex to be with Blake and Casey, potentially facilitating further interactions.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to give them the item they want.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Blake happy by fulfilling their desire for the jewelry.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: While not necessary for achieving Blake's happiness, it allows for future interactions.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Similar to Blake's move, this allows Alex to be present with both characters.
