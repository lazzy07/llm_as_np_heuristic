To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, Jones and Ross, ensuring they also have the opportunity to become healthy.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room A, preparing to assess and treat them next.

5. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B, ensuring that both patients are assigned to exam rooms for assessment and treatment.

6. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine their symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment.

8. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms.

9. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment.

By following these steps, Young will be treated first, ensuring they achieve their goal of being alive and healthy. The subsequent actions will also help Jones and Ross achieve the same goal.
