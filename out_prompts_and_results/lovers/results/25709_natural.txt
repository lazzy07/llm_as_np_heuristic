To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the bedroom to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be closer to Casey, who is in the dining room and has the potential to help Blake achieve their goal.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the chocolates.**  
   - This action is a strategic lie. By misleading Casey into thinking that Alex wants the chocolates, Blake can create an opportunity to negotiate for the chocolates.

3. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Casey moves to the living room, possibly to find Alex or to check on the situation, which allows Blake to take further action.

4. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Blake follows Casey to the living room to continue the interaction and to negotiate for the chocolates.

5. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - Blake gives the jewelry to Casey, which is a trade for the chocolates. This action is crucial as it allows Blake to obtain the chocolates while also making Casey happy by giving them the jewelry they want.

6. **Casey gives chocolates to Blake.**  
   - In return for the jewelry, Casey gives the chocolates to Blake, fulfilling Blake's goal of obtaining the chocolates.

At this point, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and the story concludes with Blake achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the exchange of items while ensuring that Blake ultimately gets what they want (the chocolates). The strategic lie about Alex wanting the chocolates helps to manipulate Casey's actions, leading to a successful trade.
