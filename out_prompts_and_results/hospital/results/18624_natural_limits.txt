Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, assesses Young, who is also in Patient Room C. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates that Young has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Young becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms and correctly identify the disease. Since Young is in Patient Room C, this action is valid and crucial for the next step.
2. **Treat Young with steroids**: This action is essential to ensure Young's health. Since the assessment revealed that Young has Jarkis, administering steroids is the correct treatment, leading to Young achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.
