After stealing the knife from the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the gym with the bully. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, is focused on his workout. Roy knows he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. 

Roy decides to take revenge on the bully. He approaches the bully from behind and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief and no longer feels threatened.
