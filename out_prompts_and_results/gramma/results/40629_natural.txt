To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the hero.** The bandit is armed with two swords and the hero is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to eliminate the hero and loot the medicine, which is not the goal but ensures no interference from the hero.

2. **The bandit loots the hero's coin.** After defeating the hero, the bandit can take the hero's coin, which adds to her collection of coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her camp with the coins she has collected.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Attacking the hero**: This is necessary to remove the only obstacle that could prevent the bandit from achieving her goal.
- **Looting the hero's coin**: This directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying coins.
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This is essential for the bandit to secure her coins in a safe location.
- **Placing the coins in the chest**: This finalizes the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.
