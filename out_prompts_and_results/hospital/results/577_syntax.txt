To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: This action is necessary because Ross is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This will increase Hathaway's workload to 1.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Young is also in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room. This will increase Hathaway's workload to 2.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Jarkis.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids in Exam Room A**: Since Ross has Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This will make Ross healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload back to 1.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. Young has SymptomB, which indicates he has Flaze.

6. **Treat Young with Antibiotics in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Young healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload back to 0.

7. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is currently in Exam Room C. Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will determine them. If Jones has a fever, he has Flaze; if he has a rash, he has Jarkis. 

8. **Treat Jones accordingly**: If Jones has Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, ExamRoomA)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Young, ExamRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, ExamRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, ExamRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, ExamRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, ExamRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, ExamRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics or steroids, ExamRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway assesses and treats each patient correctly, leading to their health and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
