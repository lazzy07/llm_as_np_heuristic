To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to confront Tom, who is carrying a coin.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This is possible because Tom is unarmed and the Bandit is armed.
