To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I1 (the item that was given to them by Casey). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (R22) to interact with them.
   - This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and potentially trade items.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the item they have (I2) to Alex.
   - This action is necessary because Alex needs to receive an item to be happy, and Casey is willing to give their item to Alex.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the room where Blake is located (R21).
   - This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake to discuss their next steps.

4. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the item they received (I2) with Blake for the item they want (I1).
   - This action is crucial because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which will make them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the item they want (I1), thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to facilitate the exchange of items.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives their item to Alex, which is a step towards Alex's happiness.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex returns to Blake to finalize the trade.
- **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: This is the final action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.
