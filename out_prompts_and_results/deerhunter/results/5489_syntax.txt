To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money, which is his primary goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and find a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba, now having achieved his goal of obtaining money, will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is still hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank to confront the clerk again. This action is necessary to ensure that he can secure his position and possibly intimidate the clerk further.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will shoot the clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate any witnesses to his crime and secure his escape with the stolen money.

The sequence of actions leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
