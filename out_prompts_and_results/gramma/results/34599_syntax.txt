To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom and the Guard.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, giving him the coin she has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without committing a crime.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant will then walk back to the Camp, where she can keep her coins safe.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary for the Merchant to be in a position to interact with Tom, who has a coin she can buy.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to gain a coin legally, fulfilling her goal.
- The third action is to return to a safe location (the Camp) with her newly acquired coin.
