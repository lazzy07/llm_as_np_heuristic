To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will also assess Young, who is in the same room. This is important to ensure that both patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

3. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is crucial for Young's recovery.

5. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomA**: After treating Ross and Young, Hathaway will walk Jones to PatientRoomA to assess him as well. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also evaluated and treated.

6. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is important to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Jones's diagnosis, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This is essential for Jones's recovery.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and well-being.
