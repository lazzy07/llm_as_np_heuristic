To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, Casey is already in possession of the jewelry, but they are not happy because they want Blake to be happy, and Blake currently does not have the item they want (I2). 

To achieve this, we can have Blake give the item they have (I2) to Casey, which will make both Casey and Blake happy. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Casey the item they want, which is the jewelry, thus making both characters happy.

After this trade, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy with the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is happy with the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) is happy with the jewelry (I3).

Now, all characters are happy, and Casey has achieved their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey gets the item they want (I3) and thus achieves happiness.
