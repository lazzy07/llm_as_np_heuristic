Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess him for any symptoms he may have. This also keeps the workload manageable, as it is still below three.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to reach Ross in Patient Room C to assess his symptoms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - This is crucial for determining whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, as it will inform the treatment needed.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Ross shows symptoms of a rash (indicating Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which will make Ross healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with their goal of having all patients healthy.
