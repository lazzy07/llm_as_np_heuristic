To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will first assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Ross based on his symptoms.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This allows Hathaway to treat Young based on his symptoms.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is currently in Exam Room B. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

8. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
