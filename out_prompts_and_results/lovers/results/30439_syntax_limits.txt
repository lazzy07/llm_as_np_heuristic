In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are currently in the dining room (R22). Casey (C3) is in the same room as the flowers but has put them down. Alex needs to retrieve the flowers to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)** - Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room.

This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (the flowers), which will make them happy. Since Alex's goal is to be happy, and they want Casey to be happy as well, obtaining the flowers is a step towards achieving that happiness.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, fulfilling their goal.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R22)"]
}
```
