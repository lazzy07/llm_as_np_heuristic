In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Given the current situation, the following action will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **trade(Blake, I2, Alex, I1, R22)**: Blake can trade the item they have (which is I2, the chocolates) with Alex for the item Alex wants (I1, the jewelry). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy. Since Blake also wants Alex to be happy, this action will also make Blake happy.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- happy(Blake) = True (because Blake has traded and made Alex happy)
- happy(Alex) = True (because Alex now has the jewelry they wanted)
- happy(Casey) = False (Casey remains unhappy as they still do not have the item they want)

This single action is sufficient for Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by ensuring Alex is happy.
