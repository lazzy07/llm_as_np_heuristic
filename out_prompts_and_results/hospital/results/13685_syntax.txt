To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room and assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young also receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the treatment.
2. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the treatment.
3. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms.
4. **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to ensure Young receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both patients, achieving the goal of making them healthy.
