Zoe and the Lizard are at the surface of the planet, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. Since they are not fighting, they have the opportunity to communicate and potentially become friends. However, the imminent eruption creates a sense of urgency.

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is taken to seek shelter from the erupting volcano, as the cave may provide safety from the lava and ash. It also allows Zoe to create distance from the Lizard, who is still on the surface.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting, and it is crucial because it leads to the next action.

3. **The Lizard is killed by the eruption.** - The Lizard, remaining on the surface during the eruption, is unable to escape and dies. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying in the story.

4. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - After the eruption, Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard, demonstrating her concern for the alien creature despite their previous enmity.

5. **Zoe realizes the Lizard is dead.** - This realization leads Zoe to reflect on the importance of friendship and safety, prompting her to change her perspective.

6. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard's memory.** - Although the Lizard is dead, Zoe acknowledges the Lizard's role as the guardian of the planet and vows to honor that by protecting the planet and its creatures in the future. This action symbolizes the making of peace and friendship, even in death.

The story concludes with Zoe's commitment to the Lizard's memory, ensuring that the themes of friendship and safety are upheld, even in the face of tragedy.
