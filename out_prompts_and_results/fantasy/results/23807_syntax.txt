To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: Gargax will take the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary because Gargax needs to acquire wealth, and Vince is already dead, making it possible for Gargax to take the money without any resistance.

2. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax will then travel to the cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location where the treasure is located.

3. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax will pick up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential for Gargax to increase their wealth further.

4. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax will become hungry after picking up the treasure. This action is necessary to set up for the next action, as Gargax needs to be hungry to fulfill their goal of not being hungry after eating.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax will eat Rory, who is still alive in the cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, ensuring they are not hungry anymore.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring both the money and the treasure) and not hungry (after eating Rory).
