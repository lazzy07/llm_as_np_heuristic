To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake currently has the item I2 (chocolates) in R21, and they want to make Alex happy by giving them the item they desire, which is I1 (flowers). 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Blake moves from R21 to R22**: This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey, where the items are located.
2. **Blake gives I2 (chocolates) to Alex**: By giving chocolates to Alex, Blake helps Alex feel happy, as Alex wants to be happy and also wants Casey to be happy.
3. **Blake moves back to R21**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's goal but can be included for narrative flow.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **move(Blake, R21, R22)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the item they want.
2. **give(Blake, I2, Alex, R22)**: This action directly helps Alex to be happy, which is Blake's goal.
3. **move(Blake, R22, R21)**: This action is optional but provides closure to Blake's movement.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have helped Alex achieve happiness, which aligns with their goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(Blake, R21, R22)",
    "give(Blake, I2, Alex, R22)",
    "move(Blake, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
```
