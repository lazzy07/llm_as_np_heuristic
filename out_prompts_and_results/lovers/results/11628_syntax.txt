To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Blake is located (R22) to interact with them.
2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers to be happy.
3. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the flowers in the room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story.
4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the room (R12) where they were initially.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake to receive the flowers.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want, making them happy.
- **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: While not necessary for happiness, it shows that Alex has the flowers in their possession.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: This action is included to return to the original room, maintaining the narrative flow.
