Currently, Alex is in the dining room (R22) and has just put down the chocolates (I3) that Casey gave them. Casey is in the living room (R12) and is unhappy because they want the flowers (I2), which are currently in the bathroom (R21). Blake is also in the dining room (R22) and is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action is taken:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I1) they want with Casey (C3) for the chocolates (I3) they currently have. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire, thus making them happy.
