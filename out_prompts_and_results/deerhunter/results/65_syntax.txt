To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, which means he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he also has the option to go back to the bank and potentially steal money from the bank clerk, who is currently at the bank and has some money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and focus on his next steps.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is essential as it positions him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads his rifle again. This action is necessary to ensure he is prepared to intimidate the bank clerk if needed.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act decisively.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to intimidate the clerk, ensuring he has the means to enforce his demands.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money from the clerk.
