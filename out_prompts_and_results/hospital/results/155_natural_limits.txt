Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Exam Room A, where Jones is currently assigned. This allows Hathaway to assess both patients together. 

1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for a more efficient assessment of both patients.
2. **Walk from Patient Room B to Patient Room A**: Hathaway moves to Exam Room A to assess the patients.
