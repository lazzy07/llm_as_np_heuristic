To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coins she has. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count without risking her own life, as the Merchant is unarmed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the Bandit Camp where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has just robbed and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
