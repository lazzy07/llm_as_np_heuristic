To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which directly fulfills his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to leave the bank after successfully stealing the money and return to a safer location.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of obtaining 1 money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and access the money.
- **Stealing the money** is the direct action that fulfills Bubba's desire for money, as he has the means (the loaded rifle) to do so.
- **Returning to the forest** is a strategic move to ensure Bubba is away from the bank and any potential consequences of his actions.
