In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Cottage and has already walked to the Crossroads and back multiple times. The Bandit has a sword, which allows her to rob others.

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant at the Crossroads to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the Bandit can use the sword to take an item from the Merchant, who is not armed with a sword. By robbing the Merchant, the Bandit can potentially gain coins or valuable items.

After this action, the Bandit will have the medicine, which can be sold or used to gain favor with other characters, thus increasing her chances of acquiring more coins in the future.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to take an item from the Merchant, who is currently at the Crossroads. Since the Merchant is not armed with a sword, the Bandit can successfully rob her without facing any consequences. This action directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of acquiring more coins or valuable items.
