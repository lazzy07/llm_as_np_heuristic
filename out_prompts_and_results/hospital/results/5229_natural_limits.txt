Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is currently in Patient Room A.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - By assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the information available.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the unknown symptoms. Since Flaze is treated with antibiotics, this action is crucial for Ross's health.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to admit the next patient, Young, who is currently in Admissions.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

At the end of these actions, Dr. Hathaway has treated Ross, who is now healthy, and has admitted Young to an exam room for further care, ensuring that all patients will eventually receive the necessary treatment.
