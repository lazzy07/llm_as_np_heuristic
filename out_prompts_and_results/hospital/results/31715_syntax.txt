To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.
