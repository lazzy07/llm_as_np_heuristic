To complete the story, we will have Zoe teleport back to the surface, where the Lizard is located. Since the Lizard is the guardian of the planet, Zoe will want to ensure that they can work together to stay safe from the erupting volcano. However, the volcano will erupt while they are on the surface, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to be with the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe wants to be safe and make friends with the Lizard, who is on the surface.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Upon arriving, Zoe and the Lizard make peace. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption causes the Lizard to die. This action is included to meet the condition of a character dying as a result of the eruption.

The final story sequence leads to the Lizard's death due to the eruption, while Zoe and the Lizard have made peace before the disaster, fulfilling their goals of friendship.
