Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the dangerous surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent threat posed by the volcano. They have just made peace, and their friendship is strong. To ensure their safety and to further their friendship, Zoe suggests they explore the cave nearby, which she believes might provide shelter from the volcano's eruption.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is necessary for both characters to find safety from the dangerous surface and the impending eruption. It also allows them to continue building their friendship in a safe environment.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to stay in the cave and explore it together.** This action solidifies their friendship and allows them to bond over their shared experience, achieving the Lizard's goal of making friends with other creatures.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship.
