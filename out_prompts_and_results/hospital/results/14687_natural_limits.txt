Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway confirms that Ross is experiencing a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, but Dr. Hathaway believes that admitting him to an exam room is necessary to ensure he receives proper care.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease, but by admitting him, he ensures that Young is in a position to receive treatment as soon as his symptoms are identified.

This sequence of actions ensures that Ross is treated correctly and becomes healthy, while also setting up Young for future assessment and treatment.
