In the living room, Casey sees that Alex is happy with the flowers, but Casey wants the jewelry that Blake has. To achieve their goal, Casey decides to take action.

Casey moves to Blake and says, "I will trade you the flowers for the jewelry." Since Casey believes that Alex is happy with the flowers, they can offer them in exchange for the jewelry. Blake, wanting to be happy and also wanting Alex to be happy, agrees to the trade.

Casey takes the jewelry from Blake, achieving their goal of being happy.
