Next, Hathaway decides to admit Young to Exam Room B.

Then, Hathaway assesses Young to check for symptoms.

Now, Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing her of Jarkis.

Finally, Hathaway returns to Exam Room C to treat Ross.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to her workload being high, but since Ross has not shown any symptoms, he is treated with antibiotics, which does not harm him.
