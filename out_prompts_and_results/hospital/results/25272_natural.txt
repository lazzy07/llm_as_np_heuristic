**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds. After assessing, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload. She treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, but since Jones is alive, he does not die. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. She assesses Young and finds that he has a fever, which indicates Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross. She assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. This time, with a reduced workload of 2, she correctly treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

All patients are now healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
