To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has money but is not in the forest, so Bubba cannot steal from the clerk directly. However, Bubba can take action against Bambi, who is also in the forest.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This will also lead to Bambi being dead.
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action will result in Bambi being dead, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her, satisfying his hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba needs to take action to achieve his goals, and shooting Bambi is a way to eliminate a potential threat and gain food.
- **Shoot Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a part of his motivation.

At this point, Bubba has not gained any money, but he has achieved the goal of having Bambi dead. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to shoot Bambi",
    "Bubba shoots Bambi",
    "Bubba decides to eat Bambi"
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending.
