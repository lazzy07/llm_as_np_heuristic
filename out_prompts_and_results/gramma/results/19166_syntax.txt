To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently carrying the medicine and has no coins. This action is possible because the Bandit is armed and Tom is not carrying a sword. The Bandit will take the medicine from Tom, which is not her goal, but it will allow her to eliminate a potential threat.

2. **loot(Bandit, BanditCoin, Guard, Market)**: After the Bandit has successfully robbed Tom, she will loot the Guard's corpse for the Guard's sword. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to arm herself further, making her a more formidable character in the market.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp and take the coins from the chest. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of accumulating coins without being killed or thwarted by Tom or the Guard.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)",
    "loot(Bandit, BanditCoin, Guard, Market)",
    "take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob**: The Bandit robs Tom to eliminate him as a threat and to gain an item, even if it is not coins.
- **loot**: The Bandit loots the Guard's corpse to acquire a sword, which enhances her power and security.
- **take**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp, achieving her ultimate goal of having coins. 

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way for the Bandit to achieve her goal given the current situation.
