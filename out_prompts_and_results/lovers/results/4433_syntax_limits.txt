In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (jewelry), and currently, Alex is not happy because they do not have the item they want. Blake has item I3 (chocolates) and knows that Alex wants I1. 

To achieve their goal, Blake can give the chocolates to Alex, which will make Alex happy. Since Alex is currently unhappy, this action will help Blake achieve their goal of making Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want (I1).

After this action, the situation will be:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = C3; at(I2) = ?; at(I3) = C1; happy(C1) = True; happy(C2) = True; happy(C3) = False; wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3.

Now, both Blake and Alex are happy, achieving Blake's goal.

### Explanation of the action:
- The action of giving chocolates to Alex directly fulfills Blake's desire to make Alex happy, which is the primary goal for Blake. Since Alex is now happy, Blake also achieves their own happiness indirectly.
