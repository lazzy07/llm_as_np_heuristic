To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine in his possession, and he simply needs to walk to the Cottage to fulfill his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it directly leads Tom to his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine. No other actions are required since he already possesses the medicine and there are no obstacles preventing him from walking to the Cottage.
