**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take a bold step. He knows he needs to secure his safety and get the pack of cigarettes. He quickly moves to the hallway, where he can access the gym. 

Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot reach him or Roy, alleviating their immediate threat. 

With the bully locked away, Ernest then puts on the civilian clothes he found in the laundry room, disguising himself. This disguise is crucial for his escape plan. 

Finally, Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once he reaches the highway, he is free to escape, leaving the prison behind.
