**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that Ernest is in the gym, locked in with the bully. Roy has a plan to help his friend and ensure their safety. He quickly moves to the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the gym. 

Once inside the gym, Roy sees that the bully is distracted. He takes out the knife he stole earlier from the kitchen and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. This act of revenge not only frees Ernest from the bully's threat but also ensures that both of them can now breathe a little easier in the prison.

With the bully out of the way, Roy and Ernest can now focus on their escape. They decide to wait until day two to put their plan into action.
