To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. The story will unfold as follows:

1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** (Talia needs to be at the cave to interact with Gargax and potentially negotiate for wealth.)

3. **Gargax accepts Talia's proposal.** (Gargax, wanting to be wealthy, sees the value in this proposal.)
4. **Talia and Gargax get married.** (This marriage will fulfill Talia's goal of being wealthy, as Gargax is a dragon and likely has access to more wealth.)
5. **Talia picks up the treasure.** (Now that Talia is married to Gargax, she can claim the treasure she previously picked up, adding to her wealth.)
