Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface, decides to take action. She knows that the Lizard is in the cave and that they need to communicate to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the Surface to the Cave.** This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and discuss their situation. By walking, she avoids making the Lizard angry, which could lead to a fight and further complications.
