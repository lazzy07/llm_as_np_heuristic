**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife, which gives him a chance to confront the bully.

1. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully directly and take control of the situation.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Ernest prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can deal with the threat without interference.)
3. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the immediate threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to be safe from the bully's violence.)

With the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison with Roy.

4. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to blend in and avoid detection.)
5. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows him to escape the prison without being seen by guards.)
6. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise and the escape route, he successfully leaves the prison.)
