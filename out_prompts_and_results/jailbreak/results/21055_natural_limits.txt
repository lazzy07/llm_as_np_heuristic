**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, feels a surge of hope. He knows that Ernest is still in the kitchen, unaware of the danger posed by the bully. The bully, locked in the gym, is still seething with anger over the stolen cigarettes.

Roy decides to take a bold step. He knows that the only way to ensure both he and Ernest can escape is to eliminate the threat of the bully. With the gym door locked, the bully is trapped, and Roy has a chance to act. 

Roy sneaks back through the vent into the prison, making his way to the kitchen. He knows he needs to get the knife to confront the bully. Once in the kitchen, he quickly grabs the knife, feeling the weight of it in his hand. 

With the knife in hand, Roy heads back to the gym, unlocking the door. The bully, surprised to see Roy, lunges at him, but Roy is ready. In a swift motion, he uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
