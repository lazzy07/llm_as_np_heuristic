Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, and they both share a mutual desire for safety and friendship. To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and plan for future explorations.

Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, leaving the dangerous surface behind. She feels relieved and safe, knowing that she can continue her mission of friendship and exploration from the safety of her ship.
