To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has the only money available.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Bubba can take the money without any resistance from the clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk and then take the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's goal of having money after shooting the clerk.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but can be included to show Bubba's escape after committing the act.

Now, let's summarize the actions in the story:

1. Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.
2. Bubba shoots the clerk.
3. Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.
4. Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
