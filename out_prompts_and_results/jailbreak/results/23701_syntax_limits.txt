Ernest, currently in the hallway, knows he needs to escape the prison to ensure his survival. He has already stolen a knife from the kitchen, which gives him a means of defense. However, he is threatened by the bully, who is in the gym. To ensure his safety and to avoid confrontation, Ernest decides to lock the gym door, preventing the bully from coming after him.

By locking the gym door, Ernest secures himself from the bully's threats and can now focus on his escape. With the gym locked, he can safely put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. Once disguised, he can make his way to the highway and escape from the prison.

Thus, the actions taken are:
1. **lock_gym(Ernest, Hall)** - This action secures Ernest from the bully, ensuring he is not threatened while he prepares to escape.

After locking the gym, Ernest can then proceed to put on the civilian clothes and escape, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
