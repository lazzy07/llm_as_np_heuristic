To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the dining room.** (Casey wants the jewelry, but Alex believes Casey has the flowers. This action is necessary for Casey to have the flowers, which will later be given to Alex.)
   
2. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.** (This allows Casey to be closer to Alex, facilitating the next action.)

3. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.** (This is the key action where Alex receives the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.)

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
