To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is already at the Market after the previous events. She will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to take action against the Merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, who is carrying the Medicine. The Merchant is armed, but the Bandit is also armed, so this action is valid. The Bandit will take the Medicine from the Merchant.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads to be in a position to take further actions.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the BanditCoin location and put them in the chest at the Bandit Camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
