**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that Jones is experiencing a rash, correctly identifies that Jones has Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, they can treat Jones without making a mistake. 

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis with steroids. This action is necessary because it directly addresses Jones's symptoms, ensuring that he becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address Ross, who is still in the admissions room and has unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is still manageable, they can admit Ross to an exam room and assess him.

2. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C. This action is necessary for Hathaway to be present in the room where Ross is assigned.

4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms so that Hathaway can provide the appropriate treatment.

Assuming Ross shows a rash during the assessment, Dr. Hathaway would then treat him for Jarkis as well.

5. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross becomes healthy, just like Jones.

Now, both patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
