After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to focus on his next goal of acquiring money. 

Next, Bubba goes back to the bank, where he can confront the bank clerk. Since he is now well-fed and has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Finally, Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using the rifle to intimidate him.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of getting money while also addressing his hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

  "plan": [
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
