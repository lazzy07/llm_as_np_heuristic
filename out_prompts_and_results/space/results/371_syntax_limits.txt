Zoe, now on the surface of the planet, realizes that the volcano has begun to erupt, making the situation increasingly dangerous. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety and to foster a friendship. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of being healthy and safe while also establishing a friendship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure they are both out of danger.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures both characters are safe from the volcanic eruption.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
