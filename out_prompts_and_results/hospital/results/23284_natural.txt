**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis (the rash symptom). 

2. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Jones dies. 

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess the next patient, Ross.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing her workload again.

5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Ross has Flaze (the fever symptom).

6. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the treatment for Flaze. Since Ross does not have Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess the last patient, Young.

8. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing her workload again.

9. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Young has Jarkis.

10. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. Since Young does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, despite her mistakes, lead to the unfortunate outcome of all patients dying. However, she has completed her goal of assessing and treating all patients, albeit with tragic results.
