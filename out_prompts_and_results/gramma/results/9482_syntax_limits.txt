To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to retrieve the medicine from the Merchant. This action is necessary for Tom to get closer to his goal.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: After arriving at the Market, Tom will buy the medicine from the Merchant using the coin he has. This action is essential for Tom to obtain the medicine he desires.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: With the medicine in hand, Tom will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to transition towards the cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
