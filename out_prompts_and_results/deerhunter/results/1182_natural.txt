Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, is in the forest with a loaded rifle. He sees Bambi, the deer, and decides to shoot her. This action serves two purposes: it allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger by eating Bambi and also potentially gives him the opportunity to have money if he can find a way to acquire it afterward.

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and wants to eat. Shooting Bambi will allow him to fulfill this need.
2. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, satisfying his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has successfully killed Bambi and can eat her, which fulfills his immediate need for food. However, he still has not acquired any money. Since the clerk has the money, Bubba needs to go back to the bank to take it.

3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

The story concludes with Bubba having both the food he needs and the money he desires.
