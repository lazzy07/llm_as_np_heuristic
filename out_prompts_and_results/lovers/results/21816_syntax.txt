To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Alex (C1) is already happy with the flowers (I1), we need to focus on Blake (C2) who is currently unhappy and wants the chocolates (I2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to receive the item they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy with the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is happy with the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) is happy with the jewelry (I3).

Now, all characters are happy, but since the goal is specifically for Casey to achieve their happiness, this action directly fulfills that requirement.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness. Blake, who is also seeking happiness, is willing to trade their chocolates for the jewelry, which aligns with both characters' desires.
