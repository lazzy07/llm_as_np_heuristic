### Story Completion

After assessing Jones in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Flaze (fever). To ensure Jones receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Jones with antibiotics.

Next, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B and assesses him. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway cannot determine his condition. However, Hathaway knows that Ross is also a patient who needs attention.

Hathaway then walks to the admissions room again to assess Young. After admitting Young to Exam Room C, Hathaway assesses him and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

By treating both Jones and Young correctly, Hathaway ensures that both patients become healthy.
