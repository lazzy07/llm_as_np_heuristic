**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Young to an exam room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.** (Hathaway needs to go back to Admissions to assess Jones, who is still waiting there.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (Hathaway needs to assess Young in his assigned room.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Rash.** (This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms so Hathaway can treat him appropriately.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** (Since Young has a rash, he is treated for Jarkis, which is the correct treatment, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.** (Hathaway needs to return to Patient Room A to treat Ross.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.** (Since Ross has a rash, he is also treated for Jarkis, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.** (Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is still in Admissions.)

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown.** (Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms.)

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.** (Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway treats him for Flaze, which is the only other disease, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

At the end of these actions, all patients—Ross, Young, and Jones—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
