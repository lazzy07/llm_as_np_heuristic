**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees Ernest and the bully. The bully, furious about the stolen cigarettes, threatens both of them. Roy knows he has to act quickly to protect himself and Ernest. He pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen and, with a swift motion, he lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully falls to the ground, defeated. 

With the bully no longer a threat, Roy turns to Ernest and says, "We need to get out of here." They quickly put on the civilian clothes that Roy stole from the laundry room, disguising themselves. 

Now disguised, they unlock the gym door and make their way to the hallway. From there, they crawl through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once they reach the highway, they take a deep breath, knowing they are finally free.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Roy uses the knife to kill the bully**: This action is crucial as it removes the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing them to escape without fear of being harmed.

3. **Roy unlocks the gym door**: This action allows them to exit the gym and proceed to the hallway.
4. **They crawl through the vents to the highway**: This is the final step in their escape plan, leading them to freedom.
