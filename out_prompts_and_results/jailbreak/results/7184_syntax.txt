**Story Completion:**

After Roy crawls through the vents to the highway, he finds himself outside the prison. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. With the disguise on, he feels safe from the prison guards and the bully. He then makes his way down the highway, successfully escaping from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: This action allows Roy to escape the confines of the prison and reach the outside world, which is essential for his goal of being alive and free.
2. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: By putting on the civilian clothes, Roy disguises himself, making it less likely for the guards to recognize him as a prisoner. This is crucial for his successful escape.
3. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: This final action allows Roy to leave the prison entirely, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
