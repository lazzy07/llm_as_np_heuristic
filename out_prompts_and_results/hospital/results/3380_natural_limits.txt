Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess them.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** (Hathaway needs to assess Jones first, who is already in Patient Room A.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** (This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** (Assuming Jones has a fever, this treatment will make Jones healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.)

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway can then proceed to assess and treat Young and Ross in their respective rooms, ensuring all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
