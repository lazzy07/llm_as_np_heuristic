**Story Completion:**

Blake looks at the flowers on the table in the living room and realizes that Alex wants them. Blake decides to help Alex by telling Casey a lie. 

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** (Blake wants to manipulate the situation to get the chocolates.)
2. **Casey, believing Blake, gives the jewelry to Blake.** (Casey wants to make Blake happy, so they comply.)
3. **Blake picks up the jewelry.** (Now Blake has the jewelry, which they believe is what Alex wanted.)
4. **Blake moves to the dining room.** (Blake wants to get the chocolates.)
5. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (Now Blake has the chocolates, which is what they wanted.)
6. **Blake moves back to the living room.** (Blake wants to be back with Alex and Casey.)
7. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.** (Blake is now making Alex happy by giving them what they want.)

At the end of these actions, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex is happy because they have the flowers. Casey is still happy with the jewelry.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Blake's initial lie to Casey about Alex wanting the jewelry is a strategic move to get what they want (the chocolates).

- Blake's movement to the dining room is necessary to pick up the chocolates, which is the item they desire.
