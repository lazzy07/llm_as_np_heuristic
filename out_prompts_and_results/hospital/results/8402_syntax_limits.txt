**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, currently in PatientRoomB, decides to assess Jones, who is in the admissions room. Since Jones is the only patient in the admissions room, Hathaway believes he is healthy and does not have any symptoms yet. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine if he has any symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, he mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis, even though he does not show any symptoms. 

2. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones is actually healthy, he does not die from the treatment, and Hathaway's workload decreases to 2.

Next, Hathaway walks to PatientRoomA to assess Young.

3. **Walk to PatientRoomA**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomA to assess Young, who is also in the admissions room.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young and mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to his workload being high. 

5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Young is actually healthy, so he does not die from the treatment, and Hathaway's workload decreases to 1.

Finally, Hathaway walks to PatientRoomC to assess Ross.

6. **Walk to PatientRoomC**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomC to assess Ross.

7. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross and mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to his workload being high.

8. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Ross is actually healthy, so he does not die from the treatment, and Hathaway's workload decreases to 0.

At the end of these actions, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.

- **Treating patients**: This is essential for ensuring the patients become healthy, even if Hathaway makes mistakes due to high workload.
- **Walking between rooms**: This is necessary for Hathaway to reach each patient to assess and treat them.
