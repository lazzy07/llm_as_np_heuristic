Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He knows that the bandit is at the market, and the guard is also there, unaware of his criminal status. To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the banditâ€™s location to the guard.
