**Story Completion:**

1. **Action:** walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)  
   **Explanation:** The Bandit moves from the Market to the Crossroads, which is necessary for the Bandit to be in a position to potentially confront the Merchant or interact with Tom.

2. **Action:** report(Guard, spot: Market, place: Crossroads)  
   **Explanation:** The Guard, who is at the Market, reports the Bandit's location to the Crossroads. This action is crucial as it allows the Guard to be aware of the Bandit's presence, which could lead to the Bandit being confronted or attacked, thus ensuring the Merchant can safely conduct her business without the threat of the Bandit.

**Final Plan in JSON format:**
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)",
    "report(Guard, spot: Market, place: Crossroads)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant can achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as the Bandit is now being monitored by the Guard, reducing the risk of criminal activity in the area.
