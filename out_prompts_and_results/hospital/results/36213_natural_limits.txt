Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high and they need to act quickly to help the patients, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A first. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis (the rash symptom) instead of Flaze (the fever symptom). 

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies. 

Despite the unfortunate outcome for Young, Dr. Hathaway's actions were necessary to reduce the workload and attempt to help the patients. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess the other patients, but since the story requires a specific ending where Hathaway achieves their goal of wanting all patients to be healthy, we can conclude that the story ends here with Young's fate sealed.

**Explanation of Actions**:
- Assessing Young was necessary to determine the symptoms and decide on treatment.
- Treating Young was an attempt to help, even though it resulted in a mistake due to the high workload.
