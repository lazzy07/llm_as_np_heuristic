In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to tell Casey that Blake wants the flowers. 

**Action:**
- Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the flowers.

**Explanation:**
This action is strategic because it creates a sense of urgency for Casey to consider giving the flowers to Blake, believing that it will make Blake happy. Since Casey wants Blake to be happy, they may be inclined to give the flowers to Blake, which would then allow Alex to ask for the flowers from Blake afterward. 

However, since the goal is for Alex to achieve happiness directly, the story can conclude here, as the action sets the stage for Alex to eventually get the flowers.
