To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, who is currently armed and has Tom's coin. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to acquire coins to fulfill her goal. The Bandit is armed and can rob the Merchant since the Merchant is not carrying a sword.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, which is one of her goals.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit robs the Merchant to acquire Tom's coin, which increases her total coins.
- The Bandit then takes the coins from the chest at the camp to ensure she has coins stored there, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)",
    "take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal efficiently.
