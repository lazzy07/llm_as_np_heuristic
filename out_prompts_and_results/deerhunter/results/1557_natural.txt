To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to use the rifle to threaten the clerk and take the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants the money, and the clerk is the only one who has it. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money without any resistance.
   
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action directly results in the clerk being dead, which allows Bubba to take the money without any consequences from the clerk.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money, and Bambi remains alive, but the story's requirement is satisfied with Bubba having the money.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** - Bubba wants the money, and the clerk is the only one who can give it to him. This action sets up the next step.
   
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
