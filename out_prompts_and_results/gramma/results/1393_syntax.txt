To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to head towards the crossroads, which is the only path available to reach the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom can walk directly to the cottage, which is his desired location.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage while carrying the medicine he purchased. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, as they are focused on their own goals.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- The first action is necessary for Tom to leave the market and move towards the crossroads, which is a required step to reach the cottage.
- The second action is essential for Tom to finally arrive at the cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.
