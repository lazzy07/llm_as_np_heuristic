To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, she will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the treasure, Talia will travel back to the village. This is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as Rory to complete her goal of happiness through marriage.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory are already in a relationship where Talia has accepted Rory's proposal. By getting married, both Talia and Rory will achieve happiness, fulfilling Talia's goal of being happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Talia to return to the village where Rory is, enabling her to marry him.
- **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's goal of happiness through marriage with Rory.
