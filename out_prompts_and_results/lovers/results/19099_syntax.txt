To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for potential interactions with the other characters.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to check on Alex. This action is included to show Casey's concern for Alex's happiness.

5. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room, following Casey. This action demonstrates Blake's support for both Alex and Casey.

6. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R21)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This action is included to show Casey's desire to communicate their own wants, even if it doesn't directly help Alex.

7. **tell(C3, C1, I3, R21)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3). This action is similar to Casey's and shows Blake's desire to express their own wants.

8. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is included to show that Alex is still engaged with the other characters.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters are still unhappy, but since the goal is to ensure Alex's happiness, the story concludes here.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions are crucial for Alex to obtain the flowers, which is the item they want.
- The subsequent moves and tells are included to illustrate the interactions between the characters, but they do not affect Alex's happiness directly.
