Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, creating an immediate threat to both Zoe and the Lizard. This action is necessary to escalate the urgency of their situation and prompt them to take action to ensure their safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is taken to avoid the danger posed by the eruption.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, seeking safety from the eruption. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and mutual goal of safety.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it ensures that both characters are now allies, which aligns with their goals of making friends.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts fully, but since both characters are now safely in the cave, they are unharmed. This action demonstrates the consequences of their earlier decision to move to safety.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves their goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
