The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is carrying the merchant's sword, the bandit decides to take advantage of the situation. She approaches the hero and, with a swift motion, attacks him, aiming to kill him and take the sword he possesses. 

After successfully attacking the hero, the bandit loots the hero's body, taking the sword and any coins he might have. However, since the hero only has the merchant's sword and no coins, the bandit is left with just the sword. 

Now, with the hero dead, the bandit feels secure enough to return to the bandit camp. She walks back to the camp, where she can store her newly acquired sword and any coins she may have taken from the hero. 

In this scenario, the bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she can now safely store her items there.

### Explanation of Actions:

3. **Walk back to the bandit camp**: The bandit returns to her camp to secure her items and ensure her safety, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.
