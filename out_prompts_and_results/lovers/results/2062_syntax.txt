To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to communicate with Casey to help achieve their goal.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This is important because it informs Casey of Alex's desire, which may lead to Casey helping Alex.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) where the flowers are located. This is necessary for Casey to be able to pick up the flowers.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers. This is crucial because it allows Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
