In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are currently in the living room (R22). Casey (C3) is happy because they have the chocolates (I3), but Alex is not happy. Blake (C2) is in the dining room (R12) and wants the chocolates (I3) but believes that Alex wants the chocolates instead of the flowers.

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I3) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy as well, since they wanted to help Alex.
- Casey will still have the chocolates (I3) but will not be affected negatively since they are already happy.

This single action ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
