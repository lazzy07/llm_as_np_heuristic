In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the chocolates (I3) they have. Blake (C2) wants the flowers (I2) but is currently unhappy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) is still unhappy because they do not have the flowers (I2).
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the chocolates (I3).

This action is necessary and sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
