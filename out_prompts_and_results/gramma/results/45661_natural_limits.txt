The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is carrying a sword, the bandit decides to take a different approach. Instead of confronting the hero directly, she quickly walks back to the bandit camp, where her coins are stored in the chest. 

Once at the bandit camp, she opens the chest and retrieves the coins, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp: This action is necessary for the bandit to access her coins, as she cannot take them from the market.
2. The bandit retrieves the coins from the chest: This action fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
