To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins secured in her possession.

The sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible by first robbing Tom and then securing the coins in her camp.
