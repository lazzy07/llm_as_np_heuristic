To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** (Rory needs to go to the village where Vince is located to obtain the money.)
2. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (Since Vince is not alive, Rory can take the money that Vince has, which will make Rory wealthy.)
3. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** (Rory returns to the cave with the money.)
4. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.** (Rory collects the treasure, which adds to his wealth.)
5. **Rory's happiness increases.** (Rory is now wealthy and has achieved his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.)

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Traveling to the village** allows Rory to access the money that Vince has.
- **Taking the money** from Vince's body makes Rory wealthy, fulfilling one of his goals.
- **Traveling back to the cave** is necessary for Rory to be in a location where he can pick up the treasure.
- **Picking up the treasure** further increases Rory's wealth, contributing to his overall happiness.
