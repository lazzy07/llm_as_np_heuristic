3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, they are friends now, and the focus is on their mutual safety and health.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they remain allies, focusing on their shared goal of safety and health.
