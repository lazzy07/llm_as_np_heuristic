Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to satisfy both his hunger and his desire for money. He spots Bambi in the forest and, knowing that he has a loaded rifle, he aims to shoot Bambi. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger as he can now eat Bambi.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, fulfilling his hunger.

With Bambi dead, Bubba has food to eat, and he can also take the opportunity to gather any money he might find later, but for now, his immediate goal of satisfying his hunger is achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to achieve Bubba's goal of satisfying his hunger while also being the shortest path to that goal.
