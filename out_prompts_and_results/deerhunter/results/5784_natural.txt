Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba looks at his money**: Bubba realizes he already has 1 money, which is his goal. He feels satisfied and does not need to take any further actions.

**Explanation of actions**:
- Bubba does not need to take any further actions because he has already achieved his goal of having 1 money. The story can end here without any additional conflict or movement.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
