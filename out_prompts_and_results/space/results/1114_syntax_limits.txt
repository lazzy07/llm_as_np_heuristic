In this story, Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous for the Lizard. Zoe has already made peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship, but the Lizard is still in a precarious situation.

To complete the story, Zoe will teleport to the surface to help the Lizard, but the eruption will occur before she can ensure the Lizard's safety. This will lead to the Lizard's demise, but their friendship will remain intact as Zoe will remember the bond they formed.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface to assist the Lizard, demonstrating her desire to help and make friends.
2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, which fulfills the condition of a character dying.

The actions are necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, and the Lizard dies, while also highlighting the friendship that Zoe and the Lizard had formed.
