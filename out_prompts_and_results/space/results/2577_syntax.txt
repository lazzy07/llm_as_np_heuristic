Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of a dangerous planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard and ensuring their safety, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, Zoe reinforces this by expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial for establishing a strong bond and ensuring that both characters feel secure.

3. **begin_erupt(Cave)**: Zoe realizes that the volcano is about to erupt, and she must act quickly to ensure both she and the Lizard are safe. This action is a strategic move to alert the Lizard to the impending danger.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard, understanding the urgency, follows Zoe back to the surface where they can find a safer location together.

5. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe also walks back to the surface, ensuring they are both in a safe area away from the cave.

6. **erupt(Cave)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard have moved to safety, they are unharmed.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully ensures her safety and that of the Lizard while also fostering a friendship with the alien creature.
