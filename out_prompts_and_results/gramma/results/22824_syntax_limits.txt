To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. Since he has already purchased the medicine and is armed with a sword, he can safely walk to the Cottage without any further complications.

This single action allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because it directly moves Tom from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be. Since he is already carrying the medicine, this action completes his objective.
