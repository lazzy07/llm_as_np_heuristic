**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A. Jones, who is currently in Patient Room C, is experiencing unknown symptoms. To ensure Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions take place:

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, as she needs to be in the same room as the patient to evaluate their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine what symptoms Jones is experiencing. Since Jones is alive, this assessment is crucial for deciding the appropriate treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming that Jones has Flaze (the only disease with a fever symptom), Dr. Hathaway treats him with the correct medication. This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.

After these actions, Jones is treated successfully and achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to physically reach Jones and assess his condition.
- The second action is critical for identifying the symptoms Jones is experiencing, which informs the treatment decision.
- The third action is the culmination of the previous steps, where the correct treatment is administered, ensuring Jones's health.
