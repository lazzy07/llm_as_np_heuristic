1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, realizing the imminent danger of the erupting volcano, decide to put aside any differences and work together. This action solidifies their friendship and mutual goal of survival.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: Once in the cave, the Lizard feels a sense of responsibility as the guardian of the planet. They decide to return to the surface to help Zoe find a way to escape the eruption, demonstrating their commitment to friendship and safety.

In this short story, the actions taken by Zoe and the Lizard focus on establishing a friendship and ensuring their safety from the erupting volcano. The make_peace action is crucial as it allows them to work together, while the walks to the cave and back to the surface show their commitment to each other's safety.
