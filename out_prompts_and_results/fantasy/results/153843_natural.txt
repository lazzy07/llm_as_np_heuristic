To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Talia needs to acquire it to help Rory become wealthy.

2. **Talia gives the treasure to Rory.**  
   - This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy. By giving the treasure to Rory, Talia helps him achieve his goal.

3. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - Since Rory is now wealthy (having received the treasure), he can be considered happy as he has achieved one of his primary goals.

4. **Rory travels to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to travel to the village to potentially find food, as he is currently not hungry but needs to ensure he remains that way.

5. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's body.**  
   - This action allows Rory to gain additional wealth, further solidifying his goal of being wealthy.

6. **Rory becomes not hungry.**  
   - By picking up the money, Rory can use it to buy food, ensuring he is not hungry.

Now, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is happy (due to the treasure), wealthy (from the treasure and money), and not hungry (by acquiring food).

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Talia picks up the treasure at the cave.",
    "Talia gives the treasure to Rory.",
    "Rory becomes happy.",
    "Rory travels to the village.",
    "Rory picks up the money from Vince's body.",
    "Rory becomes not hungry."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is carefully chosen to ensure Rory's goals are met while adhering to the constraints of the story.
