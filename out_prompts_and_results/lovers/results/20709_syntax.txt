To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where the flowers are located (R22). This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to keep the story coherent, as Alex may want to be near Casey and Blake.

4. **move(C3, R11, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be with Alex. This action is included to show that Casey is also pursuing happiness by being near Alex.

5. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the living room (R21). This action is included to show that Blake is also pursuing their happiness, but it does not affect Alex's happiness directly.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters are not necessarily happy, but the focus is on Alex achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "move(C3, R11, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R21)"
