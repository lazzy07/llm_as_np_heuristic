Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano could erupt at any moment. She has already made peace with the Lizard, and they both want to be healthy and safe. To solidify their friendship and ensure their safety, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to get to a safer location away from the dangerous surface, especially since the volcano is about to erupt.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, Zoe reinforces their friendship in the cave. This action is crucial for ensuring that they both feel safe and can work together to avoid danger.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship from the cave. This action ensures her safety as she escapes the imminent eruption of the volcano on the surface.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
