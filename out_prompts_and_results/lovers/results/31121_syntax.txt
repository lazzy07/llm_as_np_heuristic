To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the items and characters.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21). This allows both Casey and Blake to be in the same room, facilitating potential trades or exchanges.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Casey and Blake. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the other characters after receiving the flowers.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear the space and allows for potential future interactions.

6. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey and Blake trade items, where Casey gives chocolates (I2) to Blake in exchange for the flowers (I1). This action is included to show the dynamics of the characters' relationships and their willingness to help each other.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making them happy.
