To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, while the clerk has no money. Bambi is in the forest and is not directly involved in the bank scenario. 

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk to take the money without any resistance. The clerk has no money, but Bubba is greedy and wants to ensure he has the money he desires.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money from the clerk.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having money.

4. **Bubba decides to eat.** This action is taken because Bubba is hungry, and he can now eat the clerk, who is dead. This also serves to satisfy Bubba's hunger.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money and has also satisfied his hunger by eating the clerk.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** (Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (This action allows Bubba to take the money without resistance.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (Bubba now has the money he desires.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can now eat the dead clerk.)

Final state:
- Bubba has the money.
- Bambi is still alive, but the goal of Bubba having money is achieved.
