To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure from the cave. Since Gargax is already at the village and has no wealth, the only way to achieve wealth is to travel to the cave and pick up the treasure. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location where the treasure is located.

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to obtain the treasure, which will increase his wealth.

3. **Gargax travels from the cave back to the village.**  
   - Gargax needs to return to the village after obtaining the treasure.

4. **Gargax becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to reflect Gargax's state, as he has not eaten since the beginning of the story.

5. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger by consuming Rory, who is alive and present in the village.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved his goal of being wealthy (by obtaining the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Rory).
