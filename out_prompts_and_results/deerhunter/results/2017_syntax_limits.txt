1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, as he has become hungry and needs to eat.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats her. This action fulfills his hunger and allows him to achieve his goal of satisfying his needs.
