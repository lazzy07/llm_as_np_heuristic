The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and successfully killed her, looks around the market. With the guard still present and unaware of her criminal activities, she decides to take advantage of the situation. The bandit walks over to the merchant's corpse and loots the medicine that the hero had just purchased. With this action, the bandit now has the medicine, which she can use to further her own goals or sell for more coins later.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse because it allows her to acquire an item of value without needing to confront the guard or risk losing her own life. This action directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible.
