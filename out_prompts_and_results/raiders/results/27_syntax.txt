To achieve Indiana Jones's goal of ensuring the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army, already in the USA, will travel to Tanis to confront the Nazis and secure the Ark. This is necessary because the Ark is currently with the US Army, and they need to be in the same location as the Ark to take further action.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army will take the Ark from Indiana Jones. This action is necessary because the US Army needs to have control over the Ark to fulfill their goal of possessing it.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army will open the Ark. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army members. However, since the goal is to ensure the Ark is with the US Army, this action will still fulfill the requirement of having the Ark in their possession, albeit at the cost of their lives.

The sequence of actions ensures that Indiana Jones's goal is achieved, as the Ark ends up with the US Army, even if they do not survive the opening of the Ark.
