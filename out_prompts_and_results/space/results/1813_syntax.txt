To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Given the current situation, Zoe is safe on the spaceship, while the Lizard is on the dangerous surface. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt. This action is necessary to initiate the eruption, which will eventually lead to danger for the Lizard.
   
2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the cave, but since the volcano has begun to erupt, it will soon be in danger.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action is crucial as it leads to the death of the Lizard, who is still on the surface.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the eruption, Zoe, who is now aware of the Lizard's fate, reflects on the importance of friendship and makes peace with the Lizard, acknowledging their shared goals of health and safety. This action is included to show that even in dire circumstances, understanding and friendship can emerge.

The final outcome is that the volcano erupts, the Lizard dies, and Zoe and the Lizard make peace, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard attempts to find safety but is ultimately too late.
- **erupt(Surface)**: The eruption occurs, leading to the Lizard's demise.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Despite the Lizard's death, Zoe reflects on their relationship, symbolizing the importance of friendship.
