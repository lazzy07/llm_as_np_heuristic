**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Flaze, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the goal is to determine Young's symptoms. 

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing Young has Flaze. If Young indeed has Flaze, this treatment will make Young healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Jarkis, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in Exam Room B. Again, Hathaway's workload is still 3, but it is crucial to check Ross's symptoms.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB**: Finally, Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing Ross has Jarkis. If Ross indeed has Jarkis, this treatment will make Ross healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Young and Ross**: These actions are necessary for Hathaway to determine the symptoms of the patients. Since the goal is to treat them correctly, assessing is the first step.
  
- **Treating Young and Ross**: These actions are crucial to ensure that both patients receive the correct treatment based on their symptoms. The treatments are aligned with the diseases they are believed to have, which is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.
