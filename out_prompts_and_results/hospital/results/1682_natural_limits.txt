Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, decides to admit Young to an exam room. Since Young is at Admissions, Dr. Hathaway assigns Young to Patient Room B, increasing her workload to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A to assess Ross. Upon entering, she assesses Ross and discovers he is experiencing a fever, indicating he has Flaze.
