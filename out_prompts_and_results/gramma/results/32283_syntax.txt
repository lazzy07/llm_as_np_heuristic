To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront Tom, who is currently there. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to interact with Tom to achieve her goal.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of his coin. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully take the coin from him. This action directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of acquiring coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This is necessary to return to a location where she can access the bandit camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coin she just acquired from Tom and place it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to find Tom and rob him.
- Robbing Tom is essential because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without any risk of being attacked, as Tom is unarmed.
- Returning to the Crossroads is necessary to access the path to the bandit camp.
- Finally, placing the coin in the chest at the bandit camp is the last step to ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest.
