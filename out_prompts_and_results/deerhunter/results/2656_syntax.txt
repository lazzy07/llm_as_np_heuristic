To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to go to the bank to get the money. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk, as the clerk is the only one with money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After acquiring the money, Bubba can return to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank.

The actions are structured to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money by eliminating the clerk, who is the only character with money. Bambi remains alive throughout this sequence, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba obtaining the money while also maintaining the integrity of the story's constraints.
