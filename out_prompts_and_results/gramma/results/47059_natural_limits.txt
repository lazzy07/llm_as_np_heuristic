Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, armed and a known criminal. To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take action.

Tom uses his sword to attack the bandit, who is unarmed in this scenario. The bandit, being a criminal, poses a threat to Tom's safety and his goal. By eliminating the bandit, Tom can safely return to the cottage without fear of being robbed or attacked.
