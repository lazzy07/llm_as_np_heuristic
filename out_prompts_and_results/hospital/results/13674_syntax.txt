To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is also necessary to ensure that both patients receive the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for his disease. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

4. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. The same logic applies here regarding the treatment.

5. **Assess Jones in the Admissions Room**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones also receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for his disease.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
