To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted Vince's proposal, which can lead to happiness. However, she also has a proposed relationship with Rory, which complicates her happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village to confront Rory and finalize her relationship with Vince.
2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory follows Talia to the village, wanting to resolve the situation.
3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince also travels to the village to be with Talia.
4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which makes both of them happy.
5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry, which will lead him to seek food.
6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is in the cave, eats Rory, removing him from the story and allowing Talia to focus on her happiness with Vince.

After these actions, Talia is married to Vince, which fulfills her happiness requirement, and she retains her treasure, ensuring her wealth.
