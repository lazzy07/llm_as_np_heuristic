**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. She mistakenly believes that Jones is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis due to her high workload. After the assessment, she treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis but instead has Flaze, which means the treatment is incorrect. However, the treatment does not lead to Jones's demise, and he remains alive. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway, realizing her mistake, quickly assesses Ross in Admissions. She correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis due to her workload. She treats him with steroids, which does not lead to his demise either. 

In the end, Jones remains alive, and although he is not healthy, he has not died. Ross is healthy, and Young is still alive but not treated correctly.
