To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is already at the Camp, so she will walk to the Crossroads to confront Tom and the Merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying a sword but has no coins. This action is valid because Tom is not carrying any coins, and the Bandit can take the sword from Tom. 

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp with the sword.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to successfully achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Camp and needs to confront Tom and the Merchant to achieve her goal.
- By robbing Tom, she can take his sword, which is a strategic move to ensure she is armed and can defend herself if needed.
- Walking back to the Camp allows her to secure her position and access the coins in the chest.
- Finally, taking the coins from the chest fulfills her goal of having coins.
