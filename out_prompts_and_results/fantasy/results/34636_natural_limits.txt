To achieve Talia's happiness or wealth, the story can be completed with the following actions:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. By eating Vince, Gargax will also take the money that Vince has, which is the only money in the story. This action will lead to a shift in wealth distribution.

2. **Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body.** After Gargax eats Vince, Talia can take the money that Vince had. This action will make Talia wealthy, as she will now possess the money.

With these two actions, Talia will achieve her goal of becoming wealthy, which will also contribute to her happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince:** This action is crucial as it resolves Gargax's hunger and allows him to take the money that Vince had. Gargax's goal of not being hungry is prioritized, and this action leads to a significant change in the wealth status of the characters.
  
- **Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body:** This action allows Talia to achieve her goal of becoming wealthy. Since she has no wealth at the beginning, acquiring the money from Vince directly fulfills her desire for wealth.
