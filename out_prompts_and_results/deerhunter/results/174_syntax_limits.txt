Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, decides to take action in the forest where he finds Bambi. He picks up the rifle and ammunition from the house earlier, and now he has a plan to get money. 

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition, preparing himself for a potential confrontation. This action is necessary because it allows him to threaten or harm another character if needed.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi, which is a direct action to fulfill his greed. By killing Bambi, he can eat and satisfy his hunger, while also potentially taking the deer’s body to sell for money.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain strength.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: With his hunger satisfied and having killed Bambi, Bubba now decides to get money, which is his ultimate goal.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of getting money through the means of hunting and eating Bambi, which he can later sell or use for his needs.
