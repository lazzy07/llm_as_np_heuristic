To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom bought from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the bandit camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp to store her coins. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her loot in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action (robbing the Merchant) is crucial because it allows the Bandit to gain coins without directly confronting the Guard or Tom, who are both armed and could pose a threat.
- The second action (walking to the camp) is necessary for the Bandit to secure her newly acquired coins in a safe place, away from potential threats.
- The third action (taking coins from the chest) fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, thus completing her objective.
