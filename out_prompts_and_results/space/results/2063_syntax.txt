To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard interact in a way that leads to the volcano erupting, while also allowing them to become friends. The actions will be carefully chosen to ensure that both characters can achieve their goals of safety and friendship, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the planet where she can interact with the Lizard and the environment.
   
2. **Lizard walks from the cave to the surface**: This action allows the Lizard to meet Zoe on the surface, where they can interact and potentially resolve their differences.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard on the surface**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship and safety.

4. **Begin erupting the volcano on the surface**: This action initiates the eruption of the volcano, creating a dangerous situation that will lead to a character's demise.

5. **Erupt the volcano on the surface**: This action completes the eruption process, resulting in the death of the Lizard, who is on the surface when the volcano erupts.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the Lizard dies due to the eruption, and Zoe and the Lizard become friends just before the eruption occurs. This fulfills the requirement of having a character die and the two characters making friends.
