To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, he is greedy, and he is hungry. The bank clerk is also present, and he has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to obtain money.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat. This action is included to show that Bubba is addressing his hunger after achieving his goal of obtaining money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will then go to the forest, where he can find Bambi's body to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his decision to eat.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking advantage of the situation after having stolen the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba steals money from the clerk to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger after stealing the money.
- **go**: Bubba moves to the forest to find food.
- **eat**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
