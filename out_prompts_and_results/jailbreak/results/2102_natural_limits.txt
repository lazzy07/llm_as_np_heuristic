**Story Completion:**

Roy, knowing that the bully is angry and believes both he and Ernest are in the laundry room, decides to take a risk. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, he finds the bully distracted and seizes the opportunity to grab the knife that is lying on a nearby bench. With the knife in hand, Roy confronts the bully, who is taken by surprise. In a swift motion, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy returns to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, and makes his way to the highway. Disguised and free from the bully's threat, Roy successfully escapes from the prison.
