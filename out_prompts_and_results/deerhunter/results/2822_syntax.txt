To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the Clerk**: Since Bubba is greedy and wants the money, he will use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk, which will allow him to take the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the Clerk**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can take the money that the Clerk has.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action is necessary because it eliminates the Clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can take the money from the Clerk's possession. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
