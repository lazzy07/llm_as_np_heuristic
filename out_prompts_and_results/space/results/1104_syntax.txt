To complete the story, Zoe needs to make friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy. The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: If the peace is successful, the Lizard will walk to the cave to join Zoe. This action signifies the Lizard's acceptance of Zoe's friendship.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard confirms the friendship with Zoe in the cave. This final action solidifies their bond and ensures both characters feel safe and healthy together.

1. Zoe walks to the surface to meet the Lizard.
2. Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship.
3. The Lizard walks to the cave to join Zoe.
