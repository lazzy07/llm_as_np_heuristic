Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both their safety. She teleports from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located, hoping to find him there. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to confront the Lizard and address the situation.
2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks to the cave, where he feels safe and can observe the situation.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe finds the Lizard in the cave and makes peace with him, establishing a friendship.

As they make peace, the volcano erupts, but they are safe in the cave together. 

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe and the Lizard become friends while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, fulfilling the story's requirements.
