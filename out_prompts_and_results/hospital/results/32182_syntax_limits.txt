**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess (Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B to determine the symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on them first. This action is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat (Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk (Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess and admit the next patient, Jones, who is waiting. This action is necessary to continue providing care to the patients and to ensure that Jones can be treated promptly.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to assess Young, which is essential for diagnosing the disease correctly. Without this step, Hathaway cannot determine the appropriate treatment.
- The second action is to treat Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This ensures that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy.
- The third action is to walk to the Admissions room to check on Jones, ensuring that Hathaway continues to provide care to all patients and does not neglect anyone waiting for treatment.
