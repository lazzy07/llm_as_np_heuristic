To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the bank and needs to go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially obtain money indirectly by using the rifle.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money, and Bambi represents a source of food that Bubba can eat, which may help satisfy his hunger.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a priority for him.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will return to the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to be back in the location where the bank clerk is, as he may want to confront the clerk for money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk while holding the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and greed, ultimately leading him to acquire money.
