**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to Exam Room A and Young to Exam Room C, Hathaway walks back to Exam Room C to assess Young. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on identifying any symptoms. Young shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes Young is healthy.

2. **Walk to Exam Room A**: Hathaway then walks to Exam Room A to assess Jones. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

3. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics for Flaze, successfully curing him.

At this point, Hathaway has treated one patient successfully, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine if Young has any symptoms that require treatment. Since Young is healthy, it allows Hathaway to focus on the other patient.
- **Walk to Exam Room A**: This action is essential for Hathaway to reach Jones and assess his condition.
- **Treat Jones**: This action is critical as it directly addresses Jones's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, fever, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

(Note: The action of assessing Young is included in the plan for completeness, even though it does not lead to a treatment. The focus is on ensuring Hathaway's goal of having at least one patient healthy is achieved through the treatment of Jones.)
