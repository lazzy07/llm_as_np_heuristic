To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy with the item they have (I3). Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are currently in the other room (R21).

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Blake to help them achieve their happiness.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This is necessary for the next action where Alex will trade with Blake.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Blake and Casey are. This is necessary to facilitate the trade with Blake.

4. **trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up with Blake for the jewelry (I1). This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want.

5. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey. This action is necessary because Casey wants to be happy and will be happy with the jewelry.

6. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to put down the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear the room for future interactions.

7. **put_down(C3, I1, R21)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I1) in the dining room. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to show the completion of the story.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have obtained the jewelry (I1), which is what they wanted.
