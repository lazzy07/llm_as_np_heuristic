To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Alex.**
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R21).**
   - This action is a strategic lie by Blake. By misleading Casey, Blake can create a situation where Casey might not realize that Alex has the jewelry (I3) and might be willing to trade or give it away.

3. **Casey picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R21).**
   - This action allows Casey to have an item in hand, which could be used for a trade or to give to Alex.

4. **Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R21).**
   - By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey is trying to make Alex happy, which is part of their goal. This action also opens up the possibility for Alex to reciprocate.

5. **Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R21).**
   - This action is crucial as it allows Casey to receive the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. move(C3, R21, R21) - Casey moves to the dining room to be with Alex.
2. tell(C2, C3, I1, R21) - Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers, misleading Casey.
3. pick_up(C3, I1, R21) - Casey picks up the flowers to give to Alex.
4. give(C3, I1, C1, R21) - Casey gives the flowers to Alex.
5. give(C1, I3, C3, R21) - Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
