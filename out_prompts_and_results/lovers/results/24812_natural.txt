To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Casey.** (Blake wants the chocolates, and since he believes the flowers are with him, he can give them to Casey.)
2. **Casey gives flowers to Alex.** (Casey wants the jewelry, but since he now has the flowers, he can give them to Alex.)

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Casey.** - This action is necessary because Blake needs to get rid of the flowers he currently has, and since he believes that Casey wants the jewelry, he can give the flowers to Casey, who is also in the living room. This action does not directly help Blake but allows him to focus on getting the chocolates later.
  
2. **Casey gives flowers to Alex.** - After receiving the flowers from Blake, Casey can now give them to Alex. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to finally obtain the flowers, which is what he wants to be happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving his goal of happiness.
