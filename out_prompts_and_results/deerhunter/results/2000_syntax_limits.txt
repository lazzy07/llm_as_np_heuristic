To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is in the forest with a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

2. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now decide to get money from the bank. Since he is already greedy and has the intention to acquire money, this action is a logical next step.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending. 

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses his rifle to shoot Bambi, which results in Bambi being dead. This action is crucial as it meets the requirement of having Bambi dead.

2. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After ensuring Bambi is dead, Bubba decides to go to the bank to get money. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his greed and acquire money.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcome of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead, or both.
