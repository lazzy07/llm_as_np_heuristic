To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to ensure she has more coins, and the Merchant is unarmed and vulnerable at the Crossroads.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from her inventory and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows the Bandit to acquire coins from the Merchant, which is crucial for her goal of maximizing her coin collection.
- The second action moves the Bandit to a safe location (the Bandit Camp) where she can store her coins without the threat of being attacked by the Guard or other characters.
- The third action ensures that the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
