To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which directly helps him achieve his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by returning Bubba to the forest after obtaining the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Steal the money:** This is the direct action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
- **Return to the forest:** This action provides a sense of completion to the story, showing Bubba has left the bank after achieving his goal.
