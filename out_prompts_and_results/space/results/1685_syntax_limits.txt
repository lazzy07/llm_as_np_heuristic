Zoe, realizing the danger of the volcano erupting on the surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to warn the Lizard. However, she knows that this action will make the Lizard angry, as she had previously teleported to the ship. 

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)** - Zoe teleports back to the ship to ensure her safety, but this action angers the Lizard, who is still on the surface. 

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)** - The Lizard, feeling threatened by Zoe's actions, walks towards the cave to find a safe place. 

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both Zoe and the Lizard.

4. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts completely, killing the Lizard who is still on the surface.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - In a twist of fate, Zoe realizes that she should have made peace with the Lizard instead of teleporting away. She reflects on their potential friendship, but it is too late for the Lizard.

In this story, the actions taken lead to the eruption of the volcano, resulting in the Lizard's death. Zoe's decision to teleport back to the ship, while initially aimed at ensuring her safety, ultimately leads to a tragic outcome.
