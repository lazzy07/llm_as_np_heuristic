To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money. Since Bubba is currently in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and the bank clerk is at the bank with 1 money, the most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to go back to the bank and steal the money from the clerk using the loaded rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Going to the bank:** This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk, who has the money he desires.
- **Shooting the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to remove the only obstacle between him and the money, ensuring he can take it without resistance.
