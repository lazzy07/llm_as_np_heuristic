Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing the patients to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to identify his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but they proceed with the assessment to gather necessary information. 

2. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the high workload. However, they treat him with antibiotics, which is incorrect. Ross dies as a result of the wrong treatment.

3. **Walk to Admissions and Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway, now realizing the mistake, walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Young receives attention and treatment.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's actions are focused on assessing and treating the patients, even though a mistake occurs. The goal of ensuring that patients are treated is partially achieved, as Young is admitted for further assessment.
