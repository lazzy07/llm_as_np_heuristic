Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she spots the Lizard nearby. Both are aware of the dangerous environment, and Zoe knows that making friends with the Lizard is essential for her safety and to fulfill her goal of connecting with other creatures. 

To initiate a peaceful relationship, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and make peace. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's intentions, is open to friendship. They both realize that they share the same goals of health, safety, and companionship. 

With their newfound friendship, both Zoe and the Lizard feel safe and healthy, achieving their goals.

**Actions:**
1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - This action is taken to establish a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - This action is not necessary for the completion of the story but could be included if Zoe wants to explore the cave with her new friend, further solidifying their bond.

However, since the goal is to keep the story short and focused on achieving the Lizard's goal, we will only include the first action.
