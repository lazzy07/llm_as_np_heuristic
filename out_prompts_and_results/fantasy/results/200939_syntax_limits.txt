To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action is necessary because Rory has already proposed to Talia, and Talia has accepted, which means they are happy together. However, Rory's wealth is already secured with the treasure he picked up. By being eaten, Rory will no longer be hungry, as Gargax does not care about happiness but is focused on wealth and not being hungry. This action fulfills Gargax's goal of not being hungry, while Rory's happiness is already achieved through his relationship with Talia.

The story is thus completed with this single action, ensuring Rory's goals are met.
