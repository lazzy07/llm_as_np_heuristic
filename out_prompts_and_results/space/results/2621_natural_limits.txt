Zoe suggests that they should teleport back to the spaceship to avoid the eruption. However, the Lizard, wanting to protect its home, insists that they should stay and help each other find a way to calm the volcano.

Zoe, understanding the Lizard's perspective, agrees to stay and help. They both walk to the surface to assess the situation together.
