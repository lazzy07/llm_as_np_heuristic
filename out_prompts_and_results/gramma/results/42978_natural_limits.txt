The bandit, armed with the merchant's sword, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the hero is still present. The bandit then robs the hero, taking the hero's coin. With this action, the bandit successfully increases her coin collection without drawing the guard's attention, as the guard is focused on the market and not on the crossroads.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the hero and execute her plan to rob him.
2. **Bandit robs the hero**: This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she takes the hero's coin.

The bandit now has the hero's coin, fulfilling her objective of carrying more coins.
