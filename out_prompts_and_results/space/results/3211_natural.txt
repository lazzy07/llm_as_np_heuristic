Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting, she can avoid the immediate threat.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** The Lizard needs to find a safe location away from the erupting surface. The cave provides a secure environment where the Lizard can remain safe from the volcanic eruption.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** After ensuring her safety, Zoe decides to join the Lizard in the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to be together in a safe location.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in a safe environment strengthens their bond and ensures that both characters feel secure and healthy.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also making friends with each other.
