Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have just become friends, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate threat.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** This action is taken to check on the Lizard and ensure that they can work together to find a solution. Since they are friends, Zoe wants to help the Lizard, who is still in danger on the surface.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action allows both characters to move to a safer location away from the erupting volcano. The cave is a safer environment where they can both be healthy and safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they are both committed to helping each other. It solidifies their alliance in the face of danger.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
