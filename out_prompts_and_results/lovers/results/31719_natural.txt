1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex.**
   - Blake is in the bathroom with the jewelry and knows that Alex wants it. By giving the jewelry to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness.

2. **Alex moves from the bathroom to the living room.**
   - After receiving the jewelry, Alex moves to the living room, where Casey is. This action is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially help her with her goal.

3. **Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the chocolates.**
   - Alex, now happy with the jewelry, decides to help Blake by misleading Casey about Blake's desires. This action is strategic to keep the dynamics of the story flowing.

4. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.**
   - Believing that Blake wants the chocolates, Casey moves to the bathroom to find them, which is a necessary action for her to pursue her goal.

5. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.**

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry. Blake's action of giving the jewelry to Alex is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire. The subsequent actions help maintain the story's flow and allow Casey to pursue her own happiness, which is a secondary goal that does not interfere with Alex's primary goal.
