To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is essential because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate medication based on the symptoms identified. This action is vital for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Since the story only needs to focus on Ross achieving his goal, we do not need to include actions for Jones and Young.
