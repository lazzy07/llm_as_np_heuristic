To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the bathroom (R12) and has not yet obtained the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) trades the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy as well, since they have received an item in exchange.

Now, Alex is happy, achieving their goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)"]
}
``` 

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
