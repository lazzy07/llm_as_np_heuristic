To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will initiate a peace-making action with the Lizard while they are both in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that Zoe is safe and can explore the planet further without the risk of conflict.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will also walk from the cave to the surface, following Zoe. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures that both characters are safe together on the surface.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
