To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead (or both). Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to acquire the money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to steal the money. This action aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - This action directly results in Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

At this point, Bubba has successfully acquired the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: This is essential for Bubba to interact with the clerk and attempt to get the money.
- **Deciding to steal**: This action is a logical step since Bubba has a loaded rifle, which gives him the power to intimidate the clerk.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the final action that achieves Bubba's goal of having money.
