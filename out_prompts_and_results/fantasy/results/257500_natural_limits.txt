In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, as it will make him wealthy, and he also needs to ensure he is not hungry.

Here's the shortest story where Rory achieves his goal:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the cave, allowing Rory to access the treasure without interference.)
2. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** (Rory needs to go to the cave to access the treasure.)
3. **Rory picks up the treasure.** (This action allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling part of his goal.)
4. **Rory becomes hungry.** (This action is necessary to show that Rory is not currently satisfied, but it is not detrimental to his goal.)
5. **Gargax eats Rory.** (This action is the final step that leads to Rory's demise, but it is necessary to illustrate that Rory's goal of being wealthy is achieved through the treasure he picked up, even if he does not survive.)

In this story, Rory achieves his goal of being wealthy by picking up the treasure, even though he does not survive to enjoy it. The actions taken are essential to demonstrate the fulfillment of Rory's desires.
