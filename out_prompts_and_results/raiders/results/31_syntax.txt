To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, USA)**: The US Army, being armed and aware that the Nazis have the Ark, will take the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is necessary to ensure that the Ark is no longer in the hands of the Nazis.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: After taking the Ark, the US Army will open it. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, this is a necessary sacrifice to ensure that the Nazis do not gain immortality from the Ark.

3. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: The Nazis, believing they can still gain immortality, will attempt to take the Ark back from the US Army. However, since the Ark is now with the US Army, this action will not be successful, and the Nazis will be left without the Ark.

4. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: The Nazis, believing the Ark is safe, will attempt to open it themselves. Since the Ark is dangerous, this will result in their deaths.

By following these actions, the US Army will end up with the Ark, and the Nazis will be dead, achieving the desired outcome.
