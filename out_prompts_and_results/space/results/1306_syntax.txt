To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano and a character dying. The best approach is to have Zoe and the Lizard start a fight, which will lead to one of them dying, while also allowing for the possibility of them making peace afterward. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attacks the Lizard. This action is necessary to initiate a fight, which is a step towards achieving the goal of having one character die.
   
2. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard stuns Zoe in response. This action is necessary to prevent Zoe from continuing her attack and to shift the balance of the fight.

3. **break_free(Zoe, Cave)**: Zoe breaks free from being stunned. This action allows Zoe to regain her ability to act, which is necessary for her to continue the fight.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe kills the Lizard. This action fulfills the requirement of having one character die.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the fight, Zoe realizes that the Lizard was only trying to protect its home and makes peace with the Lizard. This action is necessary to achieve the goal of making friends.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, killing Zoe. This action fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt and leads to Zoe's death.

The story ends with Zoe dying due to the eruption of the volcano, while also having made peace with the Lizard before her death, thus achieving both goals of the characters.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- The attack initiates conflict, which is necessary for the story to progress towards a character's death.
- Stun prevents Zoe from acting further, creating tension in the fight.
- Breaking free allows Zoe to regain control and continue the fight, leading to the eventual death of the Lizard.
- Making peace after the fight shows character development and fulfills the goal of friendship.
- The eruption of the volcano serves as a dramatic conclusion, resulting in Zoe's death.
