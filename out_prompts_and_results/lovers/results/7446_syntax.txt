To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any character's possession, and Casey wants I2 as well. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Blake are. This action is necessary to facilitate the next steps.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2). This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want.

5. **happy(C2) = True**: After receiving the jewelry, Blake is now happy because they have the item they wanted.

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
