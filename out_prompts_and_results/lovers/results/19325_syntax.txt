To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the bathroom and has the jewelry (I1).

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the bathroom (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R22) after receiving the jewelry. This action is not necessary for achieving Alex's goal but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey, who has the item Alex wants.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This action is the key to making Alex happy, as it provides Alex with the jewelry they desire.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: While this action does not contribute to Alex's happiness, it allows for a logical progression in the story.
