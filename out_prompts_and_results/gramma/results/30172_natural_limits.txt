Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit nearby, who is armed and poses a threat. To ensure his safety and achieve his goal of returning to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the bandit’s location to the guard.

The guard, who is at the market, receives the information about the bandit’s presence at the crossroads. He quickly walks to the crossroads to confront the bandit. Upon arrival, the guard attacks the bandit, who is unable to defend herself since she is not armed. The bandit is killed, and the guard loots her sword.

With the bandit no longer a threat, Tom can safely walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine.
