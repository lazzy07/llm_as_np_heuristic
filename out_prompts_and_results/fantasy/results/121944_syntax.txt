To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be closer to Talia and Vince, as he has a proposal to make.
2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to meet Rory and Vince, where the treasure is located.
3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village, leaving the treasure behind but taking the money with him.
4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry, which will prompt him to take action to satisfy his hunger.
5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which eliminates him from the story but allows Talia to focus on her goals without Rory's interference.
6. **take(Talia, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Talia takes the treasure from Gargax, who is now the only character left in the cave.
7. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which makes them both happy.
8. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money that Vince left behind in the village.

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure and money).
