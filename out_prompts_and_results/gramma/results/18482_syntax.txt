To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation carefully. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **report(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)**: Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is necessary because it will prompt the guard to take action against the bandit, who is a threat to Tom and is currently armed.

2. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The guard attacks the bandit. This action is crucial as it eliminates the bandit, allowing Tom to safely carry the medicine without the risk of being robbed or attacked.

3. **loot(Tom, BanditSword, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the bandit is defeated, Tom loots the bandit for her sword. This action is important because it arms Tom, giving him the ability to defend himself in case of future threats.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- Reporting the bandit to the guard ensures that Tom is not in immediate danger.
- The guard attacking the bandit removes the threat, allowing Tom to proceed safely.
- Looting the bandit for her sword gives Tom a means of defense for any future encounters.
- Walking to the cottage completes Tom's goal of being there with the medicine.
