To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the bank and the clerk has 1 money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk.
   
2. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money that the clerk had, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **Shooting the clerk**: This is essential for Bubba to take the money without facing any opposition. The clerk is alive and has 1 money, which is what Bubba wants.
- **Picking up the money**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
