**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to treat Ross in Patient Room A. She assesses Ross again, mistakenly believing he has Flaze due to her high workload. She administers antibiotics, which is the wrong treatment for Ross's rash. Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's demise.

Next, Dr. Hathaway, still at Patient Room A, realizes she needs to reduce her workload. She walks to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Once there, she assesses Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway, now with a workload of 2, mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This also leads to Jones's demise.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to assess Young. She finds Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 2, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This results in Young's demise as well.

In the end, Ross, Jones, and Young all succumb to their conditions due to Dr. Hathaway's mistakes, but Ross's goal of being alive and healthy is not achieved.
