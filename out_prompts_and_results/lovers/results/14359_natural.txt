To complete the story and ensure that Blake achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey, who has the flowers, and Alex, who has the jewelry. 

2. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are wanted.**  
   - This action is a strategic move to mislead Casey into thinking that Blake is interested in the chocolates, which will help Blake later in the story.

3. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - By giving the jewelry to Casey, Blake can create a situation where Casey is happy, which may lead to Casey being more willing to help Blake.

4. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.**  
   - This action allows Blake to finally obtain the chocolates, achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Blake moves to the living room**: This is essential for Blake to interact with both Alex and Casey.

- **Blake gives jewelry to Casey**: This action makes Casey happy, which can lead to a positive exchange.
