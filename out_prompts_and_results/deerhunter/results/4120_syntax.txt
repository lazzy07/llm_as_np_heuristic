To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, who is now dead. Bubba is also hungry and has a desire for money. The bank clerk is still alive and is at the bank, where he has some money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, as she is dead and he is hungry. This action satisfies his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk using his loaded rifle as a threat.
4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is implicit in the previous action, as Bubba's goal is to obtain money.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy that hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal without the distraction of hunger.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money. This is a crucial step in achieving his goal.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is the primary means by which Bubba will achieve his goal of obtaining money. By threatening the clerk with his rifle, he can take the money without a fight.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is already implied in Bubba's actions, as he is actively pursuing money through his actions.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
