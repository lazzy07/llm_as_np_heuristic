Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently in Patient Room A with Ross, who is exhibiting a fever. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway decides to treat Ross for Flaze, the disease associated with fever. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** 
   - Explanation: Since Ross is showing a fever, treating him with antibiotics (the correct treatment for Flaze) will make him healthy. This action reduces Hathaway's workload to 2 and successfully treats Ross.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**
   - Explanation: After treating Ross, Hathaway moves to Patient Room C to assess Young. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway's assessment is crucial to determine the appropriate treatment. 

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has a rash (the only other symptom possible), Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action also makes Young healthy.

By performing these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
