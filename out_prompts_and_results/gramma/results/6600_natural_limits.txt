Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the market. He sees the bandit, who is also armed, and realizes that he needs to get back to the cottage safely with the medicine. To achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, knowing that the guard will take action against the criminal.

Tom walks up to the guard and says, "There's a bandit here at the market!" The guard, believing Tom, immediately turns his attention to the bandit, ready to confront her.

This action is necessary because it allows Tom to ensure his safety and the safety of the medicine he is carrying. By reporting the bandit, he effectively removes the threat and can now make his way back to the cottage without fear of being robbed or attacked.

After the guard confronts the bandit, Tom can safely walk back to the cottage with the medicine.
