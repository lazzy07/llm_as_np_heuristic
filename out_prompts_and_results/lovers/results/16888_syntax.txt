To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to this outcome:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) to be closer to Alex and Casey, where the jewelry is located.
2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R21). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they do not have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
