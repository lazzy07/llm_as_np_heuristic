**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, first admits Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway, unaware of the symptoms, mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the workload. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment, and Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Admissions. Again, Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. This is also the wrong treatment, and Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but this time, Hathaway correctly identifies the symptoms as Flaze and treats Young with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

In the end, only Young is alive and healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of having at least one patient healthy.
