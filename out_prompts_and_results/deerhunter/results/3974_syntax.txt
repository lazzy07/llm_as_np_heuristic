To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will need to return to the bank to steal from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and focus on his next goal, which is to acquire money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is essential as it brings him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Accomplishes Bubba's goal of obtaining money by threatening the clerk.
