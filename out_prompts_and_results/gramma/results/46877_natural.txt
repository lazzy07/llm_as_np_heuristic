To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero**: The bandit uses her sword to rob the hero, taking the hero's coin. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count.

2. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp**: After robbing the hero, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp to secure her coins in the chest. This action is necessary to ensure the coins are safe and to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **The bandit robs the hero**: The bandit, armed with her sword, approaches the hero and successfully takes the hero's coin. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

2. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp**: After robbing the hero, the bandit walks back to her camp, where she can store the coins safely in her chest. This action ensures that the coins are secured and that the bandit has achieved her goal.
