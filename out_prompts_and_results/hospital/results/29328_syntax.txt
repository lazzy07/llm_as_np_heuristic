To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will first assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room B. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also recovers.

6. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is in Exam Room C, to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are treated and healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their recovery.
