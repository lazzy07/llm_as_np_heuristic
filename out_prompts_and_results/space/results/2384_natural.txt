Zoe and the Lizard are currently at the cave, having made peace and established a friendship. However, the surface is still dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary to confront the danger of the erupting volcano and to understand the situation better. Zoe is curious about the volcano and wants to ensure that it is safe for both her and the Lizard.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of Zoe's action of walking to the surface. The eruption is a critical plot point that leads to the next action.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This is the outcome of the volcano erupting while Zoe is on the surface. It fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - After the eruption, the Lizard comes to the surface to check on Zoe, demonstrating its concern for her safety and solidifying their friendship.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** - Even though Zoe is dead, the Lizard acknowledges their friendship and the bond they formed, which is a symbolic gesture of friendship that transcends life.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard making peace with Zoe, thus fulfilling the story's requirements.
