To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently armed but has no coins. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to ensure she has coins, and since Tom has no coins, this action will not yield any coins for the Bandit. However, it will allow the Bandit to assert dominance over Tom.

2. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will loot the medicine from the corpse of the Merchant. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to take an item that could be useful for her or for trading later, even though it does not directly contribute to her goal of coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills her goal of having coins in her possession.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by ensuring she has coins in her possession at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob**: Although Tom has no coins, this action establishes the Bandit's control over the situation and allows her to assert her presence.
- **loot**: This action allows the Bandit to gather useful items, which can be leveraged later, even if it doesn't directly contribute to her coin goal.
- **take**: This is the final and most important action that directly fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins.
