To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to initiate contact with the Lizard and to be in the same location where they can interact.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard is already in the cave, so it will walk to the surface to meet Zoe. This action is necessary for the Lizard to be in the same location as Zoe, allowing them to interact.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once both characters are on the surface, Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a sense of urgency for both characters to work together for safety.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is, seeking safety from the eruption.

6. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard also walks to the cave to escape the eruption, ensuring both characters are safe together.

7. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can solidify their friendship, as they are now in a safe location away from the eruption.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
