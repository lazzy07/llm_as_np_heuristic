Bubba, determined to get the money, points the rifle at the bank clerk and demands the money. The clerk, realizing the danger, hands over the money to Bubba. With the money in hand, Bubba leaves the bank, satisfied with his acquisition.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not included because it is unnecessary for achieving the goal of Bubba having the money. Instead, the more straightforward action of demanding the money is taken.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is implied when Bubba demands the money and the clerk hands it over, which is a more efficient way to achieve the goal without violence.
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house**: This action is not included as it does not contribute to the immediate goal of having the money.
4. **Bambi remains in the forest**: Bambi's fate is not directly addressed in this story, as the focus is on Bubba's acquisition of the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement.
