Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She knows that the Lizard is in danger on the surface and wants to make friends with it. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help it, as she believes the surface is dangerous and wants to ensure the Lizard's safety.)
   
2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** (This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard without hostility, showing her intention to befriend it.)

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (This action solidifies their friendship, ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy together, achieving Zoe's goal of making friends.)

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully navigates the dangerous situation and establishes a positive relationship with the Lizard, fulfilling her desire for friendship and safety.
