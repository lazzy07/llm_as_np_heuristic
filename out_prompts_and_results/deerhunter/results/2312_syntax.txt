To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank, has a loaded rifle, and is greedy. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. Bubba's hunger is a factor, but his greed for money takes precedence.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank, and Bubba needs to ensure he can take the money without opposition.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat him. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance, which is important for his survival.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can now focus on his greed. He decides to take the money from the clerk, which he can do since the clerk is dead.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the threat and allows Bubba to take the money.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger and provides sustenance.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's greed and intention to take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finalizes the action of obtaining money, achieving Bubba's goal.
