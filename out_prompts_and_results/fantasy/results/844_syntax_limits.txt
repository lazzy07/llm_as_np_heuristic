In the cave, Rory and Talia have just married, but Rory still desires wealth and to not be hungry. Meanwhile, Vince is in the village with the money, and Gargax the dragon is in the cave, eyeing the treasure.

To achieve Rory's goal of being wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince will travel to the cave where Rory and Talia are. This is necessary because Rory needs to access the money that Vince has in order to achieve his goal of wealth.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Once Vince arrives in the cave, Rory will take the money from Vince. This action is crucial as it allows Rory to gain wealth, fulfilling his goal.

3. **get_hungry(Rory)**: After taking the money, Rory will become hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's goal of not being hungry is not affected, as he will later have the opportunity to eat.

With these actions, Rory successfully achieves his goal of being wealthy, while also ensuring he is not hungry.
