Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Upon observing the rash, Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Jarkis. Since Jarkis requires steroids for treatment, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate medication, successfully making Jones healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, but since Hathaway's workload is still manageable, they can assess Young without making a mistake. 

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making Young healthy as well.
