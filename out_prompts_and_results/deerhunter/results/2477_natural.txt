Bubba is in the forest, feeling hungry and wanting money. He sees Bambi, the deer, and decides to shoot her to satisfy his hunger. After shooting Bambi, he can eat her, which will alleviate his hunger. 

Next, Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk. Since he has just killed Bambi, he now has food to eat, and he can also use the rifle to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba shoots Bambi. (This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger.)
2. Bubba decides to eat Bambi. (This action allows Bubba to alleviate his hunger.)
3. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank. (Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk.)
4. Bubba steals the money from the clerk. (Bubba uses the rifle to intimidate the clerk and takes the money he desires.)

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money while also addressing his hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
