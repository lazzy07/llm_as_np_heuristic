To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what they want, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Alex trades chocolates (I3) for jewelry (I1) with Casey.

This single action is sufficient to achieve Alex's goal of happiness.
