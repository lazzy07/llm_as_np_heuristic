**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still low, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2, but it allows for Ross to be treated soon.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Like Jones, Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are accounted for.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway realizes that all patients are experiencing Unknown symptoms, which could indicate they all have the same disease. Given that Flaze is the only disease with a fever and Jarkis has a rash, Hathaway decides to treat all patients for Flaze with antibiotics, as it is the more critical condition to address.

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics. Since Jones is alive and the treatment matches the disease, he becomes healthy.

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with antibiotics. Ross also becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy as well.
