To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: After assessing both patients, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to admit Ross to an exam room.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room C. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

5. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify his condition and provide the appropriate treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for that disease.

7. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for that disease.

8. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Ross's diagnosis, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis).

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.
