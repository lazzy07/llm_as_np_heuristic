**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Fever, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomA to determine the symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on them without confusion. This action is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has a fever, which indicates Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Young's health.

3. **Walk Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess and admit the next patient, Jones, who is waiting there. This action is necessary for Hathaway to continue their work in helping patients.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is essential for diagnosing Young's condition accurately. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot proceed with the correct treatment.
- The second action is critical as it directly addresses Young's health issue, ensuring that they recover from Flaze.
- The third action allows Hathaway to continue their goal of helping patients by moving on to the next patient in need of care.
