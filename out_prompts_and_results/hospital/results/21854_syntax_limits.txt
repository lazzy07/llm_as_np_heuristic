To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine the symptoms that Jones is exhibiting. Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomC, Hathaway can assess him to find out if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This is crucial because the treatment will depend on the symptoms identified.

2. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, and if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway can effectively diagnose and treat Jones, ensuring that he is healthy, which aligns with Hathaway's goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones**: This action is necessary to identify the specific disease Jones may have, which is critical for providing the correct treatment.
- **Treating Jones**: This action is the culmination of the assessment, where Hathaway applies the appropriate treatment based on the diagnosis, ensuring Jones's health. 

This concise approach allows Hathaway to achieve their goal efficiently while adhering to the constraints of the story.
