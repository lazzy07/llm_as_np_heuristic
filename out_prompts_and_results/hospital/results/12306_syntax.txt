To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Since Young is in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway should assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because we need to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: Similarly, Ross is also in Admissions and has not been assessed. Hathaway should assess Ross to determine their symptoms as well. This is necessary to ensure that both patients receive the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, if they show symptoms of either Flaze or Jarkis, Hathaway should treat them accordingly. This will help Young become healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, if they show symptoms of either Flaze or Jarkis, Hathaway should treat them accordingly. This will help Ross become healthy.

Now, let's assume the following symptoms for the sake of this story:
- Young has a rash (indicating Jarkis).
- Ross has a fever (indicating Flaze).

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.
2. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.
3. **Treat Young with steroids**: Since Young has Jarkis, treating them with steroids will make them healthy.
4. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Since Ross has Flaze, treating them with antibiotics will make them healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Assess Young**: To identify Young's symptoms.
- **Assess Ross**: To identify Ross's symptoms.
- **Treat Young with steroids**: To cure Young of Jarkis.
- **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: To cure Ross of Flaze.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that both Young and Ross become healthy, achieving their goal.
