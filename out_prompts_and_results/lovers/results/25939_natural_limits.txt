In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to tell Casey that Blake wants the flowers. 

**Action:**
1. Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the flowers.

**Explanation:**
- By telling Casey that Blake wants the flowers, Alex creates a sense of urgency for Casey to consider giving the flowers to Blake. Since Casey wants to make Blake happy, this may prompt Casey to give the flowers to Blake, allowing Alex to then negotiate for the flowers from Blake, or directly take them if Blake is willing to trade.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is still in the living room.
- Blake is still in the living room.
- Casey, believing that Blake wants the flowers, may decide to give them to Blake, thus allowing Alex to achieve their goal of obtaining the flowers.
