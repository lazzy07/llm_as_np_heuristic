**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her, she decides to take action. 

1. The bandit attacks the guard. (This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the guard, who poses a risk to her safety and her goal of acquiring coins.)
2. The bandit kills the guard. (This action ensures that the guard can no longer interfere with her plans.)
3. The bandit loots the guard's corpse. (This action allows the bandit to take the guard's sword, which she can use for future protection or intimidation.)
4. The bandit then takes the merchant's coin from the merchant's body. (This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.)
5. Finally, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp with the medicine and the coins she has acquired. (This action allows her to secure her loot in a safe location.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit attacks the guard to eliminate the threat he poses.

- Looting the guard's corpse provides her with additional resources (the sword) for future encounters.
