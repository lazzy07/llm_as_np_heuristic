To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront the Merchant and take the coins she believes the Merchant has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coins that Tom had just bought from her. This action is possible because the Merchant is unarmed, and the Bandit is armed.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads to return to her camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
