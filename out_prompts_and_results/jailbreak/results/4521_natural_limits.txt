**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Ernest, still in the laundry room, realized he needed to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He decided to sneak through the vents to the gym, where the bully was currently occupying his time. 

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Ernest to avoid the bully's immediate threat while moving closer to Roy and the knife.)
   
Once in the gym, Ernest spotted the knife on a nearby bench. He knew he had to take it to defend himself and Roy.

2. **Ernest steals the knife from the gym.** (This action equips Ernest with a means to protect himself and Roy from the bully.)

With the knife in hand, Ernest locked the gym door, ensuring that the bully could not escape.

3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This action secures the area, preventing the bully from threatening them further and allowing Ernest to confront the bully without fear of retaliation.)

Now, with the bully trapped inside, Ernest was ready to confront him and ensure their safety.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Crawling through the vents allows Ernest to bypass the bully's immediate threat and reach a location where he can find a weapon.
- Stealing the knife gives Ernest the means to defend himself and Roy against the bully's threats.
- Locking the gym door secures the area, allowing Ernest to confront the bully without the risk of being attacked from behind or escaping.
