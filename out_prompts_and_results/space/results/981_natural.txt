**Story Completion:**

Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is taken because Zoe wants to be safe and healthy, and making peace with the Lizard could lead to a friendship that would help both characters. 

2. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** This action is taken as the Lizard also desires safety and friendship. By reciprocating Zoe's peace offering, the Lizard acknowledges Zoe's intentions and aligns with her goal of safety.

3. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since both characters are now friends, they can work together to find a solution to the erupting volcano, but the eruption happens before they can escape.

4. **Zoe dies.** This is the result of the eruption, fulfilling the condition of a character dying in the story.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (making peace) are crucial for establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, which aligns with both of their goals of being healthy and safe. 
- The eruption of the volcano is a necessary plot point that introduces a significant threat, leading to the final outcome of Zoe's death, which is a key part of the story's conclusion.
