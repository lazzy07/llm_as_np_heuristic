To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Given the current situation, Casey (C3) has the jewelry in the bathroom (R12). 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **Action: move(C3, R22, R12)** - Casey moves to the bathroom to retrieve the jewelry. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Blake.

2. **Action: give(C3, I2, C2, R12)** - Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action is essential for Blake to achieve happiness, as it directly provides Blake with the item they want.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they will have the jewelry.
