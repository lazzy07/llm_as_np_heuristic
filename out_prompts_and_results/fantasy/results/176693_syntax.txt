To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already engaged to Talia, marrying her will increase his happiness. Additionally, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave to become wealthy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, which will increase his wealth.
2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia, which will increase his happiness.

After these actions, Rory will have the treasure, making him wealthy, and he will be married to Talia, making him happy. He will not be hungry since he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Rory to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can increase his wealth.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Rory to achieve happiness, as marrying Talia fulfills his emotional goal.
