**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that there are still patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Ross dies.

Afterward, Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room A. This reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2. 

Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room A. Again, Young's symptoms are unknown, and Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis due to the workload. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, and Young also dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Ross and Young, Hathaway has successfully treated Jones, who is still alive and healthy, fulfilling the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
