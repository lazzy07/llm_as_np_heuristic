**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest realizes he must act quickly to protect himself and Roy from the bully's threats. He decides to leave the cell block and head to the laundry room to retrieve the civilian clothes, hoping to disguise himself and escape.

1. **Ernest moves to the laundry room.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the civilian clothes, which he needs for disguise.)
   
2. **Ernest steals the civilian clothes from the laundry room.** (This action allows Ernest to prepare for his escape.)

3. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for him to access the highway.)

4. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action disguises him, making it safer for him to escape.)

5. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows him to leave the prison without being detected.)

Meanwhile, in the gym, Roy is still under threat from the bully. He knows he needs to act to protect himself and Ernest. 

6. **Roy waits in the gym, observing the bully.** (This action is necessary for Roy to assess the situation and look for an opportunity.)

7. **Roy steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This action gives Roy a means to defend himself against the bully.)

8. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him.)

9. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Ernest.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely join Ernest outside.

10. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows him to escape the prison as well.)

In the end, both characters achieve their goals: Ernest escapes safely, and Roy overcomes the bully's threat by killing him.
