**Story Completion:**

As the tension in the gym escalates, Ernest and Roy realize they need to act quickly to avoid the bully's threats. They know that the knife is in the kitchen, and if they can get it, they might have a chance to defend themselves or even get revenge on the bully.

1. **Action: Roy sneaks out of the gym and crawls through the vents to the kitchen.**  
   - **Explanation:** This action is necessary for Roy to retrieve the knife, which is essential for either defending himself and Ernest or taking revenge on the bully. Crawling through the vents allows him to avoid the bully and the guards.

2. **Action: Roy returns to the gym with the knife and kills the bully.**  
   - **Explanation:** This action allows Roy to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Ernest are no longer in danger. It also serves as revenge for the bully's earlier threats.

With the bully dead, Roy and Ernest are free from the immediate threat, and they can plan their next move without fear.
