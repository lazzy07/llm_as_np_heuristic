To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, we need to ensure that Casey is happy as well, since Casey's happiness is tied to Blake's happiness. Given the current situation, we can see that Casey is unhappy because they want item I3 (the jewelry), which is currently with Blake. 

The simplest way to achieve this is for Blake to give the jewelry to Casey. Since Blake is in the same room as the jewelry (R21), they can easily give it to Casey, who is in R22. 

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(Blake, I3, Casey, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have I1 (the flowers).
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have I3 (the jewelry).
- Blake (C2) remains happy because they want I2 (the chocolates), which they still have.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the jewelry, which in turn aligns with Alex's goal of ensuring Casey's happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
