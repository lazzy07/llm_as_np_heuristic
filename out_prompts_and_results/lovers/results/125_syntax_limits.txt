In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they do not have the item they want (I3 - flowers), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they do not have the item they want (I2 - chocolates). 

To ensure Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **Tell Blake that Casey wants the flowers (I3)**: This action is necessary because it informs Blake about what Casey desires, which can lead to a potential trade or action that can make Casey happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex has informed Blake about Casey's desire for flowers, which may prompt Blake to act in a way that could help Casey achieve happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **tell(C1, C2, I3, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that Casey wants the flowers. This action is crucial because it sets the stage for Blake to understand what Casey needs, potentially leading to a resolution where Casey can become happy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["tell(C1, C2, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most effective way for Alex to work towards making Casey happy while also achieving their own goal of happiness.
