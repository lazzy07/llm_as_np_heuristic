Hawkins, having spread the rumor that the treasure is buried on the island, now has Silver convinced that they should go there to find it. 

1. **sail()**: Hawkins and Silver work together to sail from the port to the island. This action is necessary because they need to reach the location of the treasure.

2. **dig()**: Once they arrive on the island, Hawkins digs up the treasure. This action is essential as it allows Hawkins to access the treasure that he desires.

3. **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: Finally, Hawkins takes the treasure. This action is the culmination of his efforts and ensures that he ends up with the treasure.

By following this sequence of actions, Hawkins successfully achieves his goal of obtaining the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
