Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both his needs. He knows that the bank clerk has money, and he wants it for himself. 

1. **Steal**: Bubba goes back to the bank, where the clerk is located. He uses his loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steals the money from him. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

2. **Eat**: After stealing the money, Bubba feels hungry and decides to eat Bambi, who is also in the forest. He uses his rifle to shoot Bambi, allowing him to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his need for food.
