To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially encounter Tom and the Merchant. This action is necessary as it brings the Bandit closer to the Merchant, allowing for a potential robbery.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs the Merchant of her coin. This action is crucial for the Merchant to lose her coin, which aligns with the Bandit's goal of acquiring coins.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market to confront the Bandit. This action is necessary for the Merchant to be present in the same location as the Bandit after the robbery.

4. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit to the Guard. This action is essential for the Merchant to ensure that the Bandit is dealt with, allowing her to continue her business without fear of being robbed again.

5. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads to deal with the Bandit. This action is necessary for the Guard to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report.

6. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard attacks and kills the Bandit. This action is crucial for eliminating the threat posed by the Bandit, allowing the Merchant to operate freely.

7. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant loots the coins from the Bandit's corpse. This action is necessary for the Merchant to acquire coins without becoming a criminal herself.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant successfully acquires coins while ensuring that she does not engage in criminal activity.
