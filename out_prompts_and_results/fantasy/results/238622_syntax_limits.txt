To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where Vince is located. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince to interact with him and potentially acquire the money that Vince has.
