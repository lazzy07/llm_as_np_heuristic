To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. Since Young is the only patient assigned to Exam Room A, this action is necessary to understand what disease Young might have.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Jones in Exam Room C to identify his symptoms. This is crucial for determining the correct treatment for Jones.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms to ensure he becomes healthy.
