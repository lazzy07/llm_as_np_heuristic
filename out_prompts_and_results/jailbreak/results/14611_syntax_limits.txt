**Story Completion:**

After Roy's chores in the laundry, he decides to take a risk. Knowing that the bully is in the gym, he sneaks back to the hallway. He locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from threatening him or Ernest while they plan their next move.

Next, Roy crawls through the vents to the kitchen, where he retrieves the knife. This is a strategic move, as it gives him a means to defend himself and potentially eliminate the bully's threat once and for all.

On day two, Roy returns to the gym, now armed with the knife. He confronts the bully, who is furious about being locked in. In a desperate struggle, Roy kills the bully, finally overcoming the threat that has loomed over him and Ernest.
