To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway should first assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Ross based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This allows Hathaway to treat Young based on the symptoms identified.

5. **Treat Ross**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room C, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young in Exam Room B based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated appropriately, leading to their recovery.
