To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the Merchant's sword. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to ensure they are armed to defend against any potential threats, especially from the Guard.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is crucial as it increases the Bandit's coin count, moving closer to their goal of having as many coins as possible.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the BanditCoin chest at the camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in a safe location, fulfilling the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves their goal by first ensuring they are armed, then acquiring more coins from Tom, and finally securing the coins in the chest at the camp.
