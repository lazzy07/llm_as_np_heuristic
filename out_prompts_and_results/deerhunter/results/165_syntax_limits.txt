To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the house and go to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will shoot the clerk with the rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while also eliminating the clerk, which is a necessary step since the clerk is the only character with money.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who poses a threat and has the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
