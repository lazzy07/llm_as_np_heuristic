To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk, who is at the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to acquire the money, as the clerk is the only one who has it.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba goes to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi to fulfill his next goal.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, ensuring that Bambi is dead. This action is included to meet the requirement of the story where either Bubba has the money or Bambi is dead.

By executing these actions, we achieve the goal of the story.
