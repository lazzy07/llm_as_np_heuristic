To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of having money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to interact with the clerk to obtain the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to return to the forest after successfully stealing the money, ensuring he is away from the clerk.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is already dead. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: This is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the direct action that fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.
- **Returning to the forest**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to Bubba's journey after obtaining the money.
