To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will also need to go back to the bank to steal from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because he is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is essential as he needs to be at the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.

3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Before confronting the clerk, Bubba will load his rifle again. This action is necessary to ensure he is prepared to intimidate the clerk if needed.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk. This action is the culmination of his greed and the goal he set out to achieve.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next actions.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can achieve his goal of acquiring money.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to intimidate the clerk, ensuring he can successfully steal the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
