To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially obtain money through a more aggressive means.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the Forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat, and Bambi represents a source of food. Additionally, if Bambi is killed, Bubba can eat her, which will satisfy his hunger.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat her. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's hunger, which is one of his immediate needs.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will return to the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the location where the Clerk is, as he may want to confront the Clerk for money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded and having just eaten, Bubba will steal the money from the Clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger first, which is crucial for his survival, and then he confronts the Clerk to steal the money, thus achieving his goal of obtaining money.
