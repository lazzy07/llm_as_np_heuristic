**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Roy is still in the laundry room, unaware of the danger they are both in. 

1. **Ernest moves to the highway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to be in a position to escape.)
2. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to disguise himself and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.)
3. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (This action is the ultimate goal for Ernest, allowing him to achieve his desire to be alive and free.)

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the laundry room, is unaware of Ernest's successful escape. He holds the pack of cigarettes, but the bully's threat looms over him. However, since Ernest has escaped, he is no longer in immediate danger.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Moving to the highway**: This is essential for Ernest to reach a location where he can escape.
- **Putting on civilian clothes**: This disguises Ernest, making it less likely for guards or the bully to recognize him as a prisoner.
- **Escaping from the prison**: This is the final action that fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free.
