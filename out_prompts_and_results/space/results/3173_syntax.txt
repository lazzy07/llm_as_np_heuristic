To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to establish a friendly relationship. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to continue building their friendship in a safe environment.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures they are both in a safe location away from the dangers of the surface.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event highlights the importance of their previous actions in ensuring their safety.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
