**Story Completion:**

On day one, Roy is in the kitchen after completing his chores. He has just stolen a knife from the kitchen, which he knows he can use to defend himself and Ernest against the bully. However, he is still threatened by the bully, who is currently in the gym.

To ensure his and Ernest's safety, Roy decides to take action. He moves from the kitchen to the hallway, where he can access the gym. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, allowing Roy to confront him without the risk of being attacked.

With the gym door locked, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Ernest. This action ensures that they can live without fear of being harmed.
