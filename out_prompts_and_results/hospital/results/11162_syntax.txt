To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in PatientRoomA, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB. This is important to determine Young's symptoms as well, ensuring that both patients receive the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will be able to treat both patients correctly, thus achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Jones.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Young.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment. This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment. This is crucial for Young to become healthy.

After these actions, both Jones and Young will be healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
