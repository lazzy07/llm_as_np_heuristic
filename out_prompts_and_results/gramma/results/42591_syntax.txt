To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant buys the medicine from herself**: The Merchant can buy the medicine from her own stock using one of the coins she has. This action allows her to keep the medicine while also increasing her inventory of items, which can be valuable for future trades.

2. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads**: The Merchant will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is also at the Crossroads.

3. **Merchant sells the medicine to Tom**: The Merchant can sell the medicine to Tom for a coin. This action allows her to gain a coin while providing Tom with the medicine he desires.

4. **Merchant walks to the Market**: The Merchant will then walk back to the Market to continue her business and potentially find more opportunities to earn coins.

5. **Merchant buys another item (if available)**: If there are any items available for sale at the Market, the Merchant can buy them using her coins, further increasing her inventory.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant maximizes her coins while adhering to her goal of not becoming a criminal.
