In the current situation, all characters are in the dining room (R21), and none of them are happy. Casey wants the jewelry (I3), which is currently with Blake (C2). To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Blake to give the jewelry to Casey.

Hereâ€™s the action that will lead to Casey achieving their goal:

1. **give(Blake, I3, Casey, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey in the dining room. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- at(C1) = R21; at(C2) = R21; at(C3) = R21; at(I1) = R21; at(I2) = R21; at(I3) = C3;
- happy(C1) = False; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = True; 
- wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3.

Casey is now happy because they have the item they wanted.

### Explanation of the action:
- The action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the jewelry, which is the only item that can make Casey happy. Since all characters are in the same room, this action can be executed without any complications.
