In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy. Since Alex believes that the jewelry is with Casey (C3), the most efficient action for Alex to take is to trade the item they have (which is currently unknown but can be assumed to be the flowers or chocolates) with Casey for the jewelry.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the item they have (I3, which is the flowers) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey is now unhappy because they have given away the jewelry (I1) but they still have the flowers (I3).
- Blake remains unhappy as they have not received any item.

The story is complete with just this one action, as it directly leads to Alex achieving their goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively shows the single action taken to ensure Alex's happiness while keeping the story concise.
