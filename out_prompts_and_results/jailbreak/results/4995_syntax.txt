**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take action. He knows that Ernest is in the kitchen and is threatened by the bully. Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, crawls through the vent from the highway back into the prison. 

Once in the hallway, he moves towards the gym. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that he needs to help Ernest. Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping.
