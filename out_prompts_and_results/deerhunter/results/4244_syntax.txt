To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle and is greedy for money.
2. **Go**: Bubba will then go to the forest where Bambi is located.
3. **Shoot**: Finally, Bubba will shoot Bambi, killing her.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba is greedy and wants money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the bank clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
   
2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba moves to the forest where Bambi is located. This is necessary for the next action, which is to confront Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: With Bambi in the forest, Bubba uses his rifle to shoot her. This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

By executing these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, achieving the desired outcome.
