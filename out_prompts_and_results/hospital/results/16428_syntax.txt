To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway successfully treats Young, who is currently in Exam Room C with SymptomB. Since SymptomB is not defined in the context of the diseases Flaze and Jarkis, we will assume it corresponds to one of the diseases. For the sake of this story, let's say SymptomB is a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. 

Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, so the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young to confirm the symptoms. Since Young is already in Exam Room C, Hathaway can assess without moving. This action is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Young.

2. **Treat Young**: After confirming that Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it will make Young healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.

3. **Admit Ross**: Since Ross is still in the admissions room and needs to be treated, Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure Ross can be assessed and treated next.

4. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Jones and Ross. This action is necessary to check on their conditions and ensure they receive the appropriate treatment.

5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Ross.

6. **Treat Ross**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

7. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Jones.

8. **Treat Jones**: If Jones shows symptoms of either disease, Hathaway will treat him accordingly. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will achieve the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
