### Story Completion

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Exam Room A with Ross, who has been admitted there. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there's a risk of making a mistake if she assesses or treats a patient. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to act carefully.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is the only patient in the room, this action is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis. 

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to find Jones and Young, who are currently waiting there. This action is necessary to reduce her workload and to assess the other patients.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms as well. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their respective diseases.

5. **Treat Ross**: After assessing all patients, Hathaway treats Ross based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
