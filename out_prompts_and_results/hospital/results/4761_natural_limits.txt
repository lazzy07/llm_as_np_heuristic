**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, decides to admit Jones to Patient Room B to assess his condition. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 1. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A, discovering that he has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. This reduces Hathaway's workload back to 0.

Finally, Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to exam rooms for assessment. It also allows Hathaway to focus on Ross in Patient Room A without increasing her workload too much.
   
2. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: This is crucial for identifying Ross's symptoms. Since he has a fever, it indicates he has Flaze, which needs to be treated.
