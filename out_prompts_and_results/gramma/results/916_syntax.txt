To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the market, so she will walk to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is at the crossroads.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is not armed, and take the coins he is carrying. This action is necessary for the bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin count.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The bandit walks to the crossroads to confront Tom.
- The bandit robs Tom to acquire his coins, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.
- Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at her camp, further increasing her total.
