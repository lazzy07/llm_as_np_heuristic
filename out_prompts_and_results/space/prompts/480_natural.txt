 I will describe a setting and the first part of a story. Your job is to complete the story to ensure it has a specific ending. 

There are three locations in this story: a spaceship orbiting a planet, the surface of the planet, and a cave on the planet. There are two characters in the story. Zoe is a space explorer and captain of the spaceship. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with other creatures. The Lizard is an alien creature that is the guardian of the planet. The Lizard wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with other creatures. There are ten kinds of actions characters can take in the story. Zoe can teleport from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. Zoe can teleport from the surface of the planet to the spaceship, but this makes the Lizard angry. A character can walk between locations on the planet. Two characters who are in the same location can begin a fight, which causes them to be enemies. A fight automatically ends if a character is stunned, killed, or leaves the location where the fight is happening. One character can stun another character that they are fighting. A stunned character cannot take any actions except to break free. A stunned character can break free from being stunned, and after breaking free can act again. One character can kill another character that they are fighting. Two characters can become friends if they are not fighting. A volcano on the surface of the planet can start erupting at any time. A volcano on the surface which has started erupting can finish erupting, which kills any characters that are on the surface of the planet.

 Characters can teleport to and from the ship, walk, attack, stun, kill, break free, and make peace. Also, landforms can begin to erupt and then erupt.


 These events have already happened in the story: 
Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.The surface begins to erupt.Zoe teleports to the ship from the surface.Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.Zoe teleports to the ship from the surface.Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.Zoe teleports to the ship from the surface.Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.


 This is the current situation after those events:
Zoe is at the surface.  The lizard is at the cave.  Zoe and the lizard are not fighting.  The lizard and Zoe are not fighting.  The lizard is not the guardian of the surface.  Zoe and the lizard have no relationship.  The lizard and Zoe have no relationship.  Zoe is not safe.  The lizard is safe.  Zoe is healthy.  The lizard is healthy.  The surface is dangerous.  Zoe believes that Zoe is at the surface.  Zoe believes that the lizard is at the cave.  Zoe believes that the lizard is not the guardian of the surface.  Zoe believes that Zoe is healthy.  Zoe believes that the lizard is healthy.  Zoe believes that the surface is dangerous.  The lizard believes that Zoe is at the ship.  The lizard believes that the lizard is at the cave.  The lizard believes that Zoe is healthy.  The lizard believes that the lizard is healthy.  The lizard believes that the surface is safe.  


 Complete the story using only these locations, items, characters, and actions. Do not invent new locations, items, characters, or actions. Characters should only take actions that help to achieve their goals, and the story should only include actions which are necessary to achieve the ending. Give me the shortest story 

 where Zoe  achieves their goal.


 Explain why each action is in the story. After the explanation of the whole story, give a JSON object with the final plan. The JSON should include an array called 'plan' with the sequence of actions (as a string) taken to achieve the goal. Example format: {plan: ['action1', 'action2', 'action3']}.
