Dr. Hathaway, at the Admissions room, sees that all three patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are present and alive. With a workload of 3, Hathaway knows that she must act quickly to assess and treat the patients before making a mistake due to the high workload.

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to assign Young to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat him. It also reduces the number of patients in Admissions, which is crucial for managing her workload.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A.**  
   - Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since she has just admitted Young to Exam Room A, her workload is now 2, reducing the risk of making a mistake.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is critical for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A.**  
   - After treating Ross, Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. Since her workload is still manageable, she can accurately diagnose and treat him.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway treats him with steroids, ensuring he becomes healthy as well.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
