Zoe, being on the spaceship, realizes that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano. She wants to help the Lizard and make a friend. To achieve this, she decides to teleport back to the surface to assist the Lizard.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to be with the Lizard, as she believes he is in danger and wants to help him.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is, showing her intention to help and befriend him.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which allows them to become friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making a friend and ensuring both of them are safe.
