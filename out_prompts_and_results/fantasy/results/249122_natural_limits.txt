To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following actions:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince to access the money.)
2. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** (This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he takes the money that Vince has.)
3. **Rory's happiness increases to 1.** (Rory is now wealthy, which contributes to his happiness.)
4. **Rory's hunger remains at 0.** (Rory is not hungry, as he has not taken any actions that would make him hungry.)

With these actions, Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Vince travels from the cave to the village:** This is essential for Rory to access the money, as he cannot take it if Vince is not present in the village.
- **Rory takes the money from Vince:** This action directly fulfills Rory's goal of becoming wealthy, as he now possesses the money.
