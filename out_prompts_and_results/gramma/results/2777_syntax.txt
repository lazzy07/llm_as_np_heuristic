To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit walks to the merchant's location to confront her and potentially rob her of her sword or coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Merchant)**: The bandit robs the merchant, taking one of the coins she is carrying. This action is possible because the bandit is armed with a sword, and the merchant is not armed (as per the current situation).

3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit walks back to the crossroads after robbing the merchant.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the Merchant**: The bandit needs to confront the merchant to rob her, so she must move to her location.
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This action allows the bandit to gain a coin without needing to kill the merchant, which aligns with her goal of accumulating coins.
- **Walking back to the Crossroads**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit returns to a neutral location where she can plan her next move.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action allows the bandit to maximize her coin collection, fulfilling her goal.
