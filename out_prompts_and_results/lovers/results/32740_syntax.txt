To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex picks up the chocolates. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story and keep Alex in the same room as Casey and Blake.

4. **give(C1, I3, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates to themselves (this is a placeholder action to indicate that Alex has the chocolates). This action is included to signify that Alex now possesses the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the chocolates.
