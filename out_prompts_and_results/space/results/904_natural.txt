1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends, and the urgency of the situation allows for understanding.

2. **Zoe uses the spaceship's communication system to call the Lizard.** This action is implied as Zoe would want to ensure the Lizard knows she is safe and to encourage the Lizard to join her.

3. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** This action is taken by the Lizard to find a safe place away from the erupting surface. The cave is a safer location.

4. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** This action allows Zoe to reunite with the Lizard in a safe location, ensuring both characters are healthy and safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** This action reinforces their friendship and mutual understanding, ensuring they can work together in the future.
