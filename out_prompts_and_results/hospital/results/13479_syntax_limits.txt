**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment plan.

2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway determines that he has Flaze (fever) and treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway then walks Jones from the admissions room to PatientRoomB, where he can be assessed next. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to and to maintain Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (assessing Ross) is essential to diagnose his condition accurately. Without this step, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.
- The second action (treating Ross) is critical as it directly leads to Ross's recovery, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
- The third action (walking Jones) is necessary to keep the flow of patient care moving, allowing Hathaway to continue his work with other patients.
