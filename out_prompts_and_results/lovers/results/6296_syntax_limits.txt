In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they believe that the flowers are with Casey (C3). 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action is taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R11)**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the flowers (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex now has the flowers (I1) and is happy.
- Casey has the jewelry (I3) and is also happy because they received an item they wanted in the trade.

The story is complete with this single action, as it fulfills Alex's goal of happiness.
