**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, now on the highway, realizes he needs to disguise himself to avoid being caught. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and escape the prison without being recognized.

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the kitchen, is aware of the threat posed by the bully. He decides to take a risk and sneaks into the kitchen to grab the knife. This is a necessary action because it gives him a means of defense against the bully if he encounters him.

With the civilian clothes on, Ernest feels more secure. He knows he must escape before the bully realizes what has happened. He moves towards the highway, where he can finally make his escape. 

On the second day, Roy, now armed with the knife, decides to confront the bully in the gym. He sneaks through the hallway and unlocks the gym door, catching the bully off guard. This confrontation is essential for Roy to ensure that he and Ernest can escape without the bully's threat looming over them.
