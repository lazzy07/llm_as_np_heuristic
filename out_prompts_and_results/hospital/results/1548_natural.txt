**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young, who is currently in Admissions. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to assign Young to an exam room so that Hathaway can assess and treat him.)
   
2. **Young walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary for Young to be in the room where he can be assessed and treated.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** (Assuming Young has Jarkis, this action is necessary to treat him correctly, as the treatment for Jarkis is steroids.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** (Since Ross has a fever, this action is necessary to treat him correctly for Flaze.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, ensuring they are healthy.
