To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy with the item they have (I3). Blake (C2) has the chocolates (I2) and is not happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is important because it allows Blake to help Alex, and it also makes Blake feel good about helping a friend, even if it doesn't directly make them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the room where the jewelry is located (R21). This is necessary for Alex to pick up the jewelry.

4. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1). This is the crucial action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy.

5. **put_down(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I2) in the room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the room organized and allows for the possibility of Blake picking them up later.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry and will be happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake and Casey to interact with them.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives chocolates to Alex, which helps Alex feel supported and allows Blake to feel good about helping.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to return to the room where the jewelry is located to pick it up.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **put_down(C1, I2, R21)**: This action is optional but helps maintain the flow of items in the story.
