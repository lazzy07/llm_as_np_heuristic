**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is in Patient Room A and showing symptoms of a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To avoid this, Hathaway first assesses Young in Patient Room C to see if he has any symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young and reduce the risk of making a mistake with Ross.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Unknown.** (This action is necessary to gather information about Young's condition, even though it is unknown.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.** (This action is necessary to admit Jones to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to reduce the workload.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to assign Jones to an exam room, which will help Hathaway manage the patients.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Jones.)

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown.** (This action is necessary to gather information about Jones's condition.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to treat Ross.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** (This action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment for his rash, which is a symptom of Jarkis.)
