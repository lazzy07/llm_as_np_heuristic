To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface, making the environment dangerous and setting the stage for the climax of the story.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: After the eruption begins, Zoe and the Lizard can take a moment to recognize the danger they are in. This action allows them to put aside any differences and become friends, which aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action completes the eruption process, resulting in the volcano erupting fully. Since the surface is dangerous, this will lead to the death of one of the characters.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and is likely to be affected by the eruption, this action will result in the Lizard dying due to the volcanic eruption.

The final sequence of actions ensures that the volcano erupts, the Lizard dies, and Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption takes its toll.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the volcanic eruption, creating a dangerous situation.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their desire for companionship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Completes the eruption, leading to the consequences of the dangerous environment.
- **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Results in the Lizard's death due to the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
