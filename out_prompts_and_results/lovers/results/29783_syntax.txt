To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey has the flowers (I1) and needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the flowers.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where Alex and Casey are. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamic and allows Blake to be involved in the resolution.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) after receiving the flowers. This action is optional but can be seen as Alex wanting to share their happiness with Blake and Casey.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
