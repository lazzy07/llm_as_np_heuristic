To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit moves to the Merchant's location to confront her and potentially rob her of her sword or coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Merchant)**: The bandit robs the Merchant, taking one of her coins. This action is possible because the Merchant is not armed with a sword, making her vulnerable to robbery.

3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Camp)**: The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, carrying the stolen coin.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit places the stolen coin into the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully increases her coin count without being killed or caught by the guard.
