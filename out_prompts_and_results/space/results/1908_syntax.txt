Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of a dangerous planet where a volcano has begun to erupt. She has already made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, which is crucial for her goal of making friends. However, both characters are currently in a dangerous situation, and Zoe needs to ensure their safety.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action has already occurred, indicating that the volcano is active and poses a threat to both Zoe and the Lizard.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is, seeking a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are safe.
4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)** - The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring they are both in the same safe location. This action reinforces their friendship and safety.
5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Although they are already friends, this action can symbolize their commitment to working together for mutual safety and friendship in the cave.

By walking to the cave, Zoe and the Lizard avoid the dangers of the erupting volcano, ensuring their safety and solidifying their friendship.
