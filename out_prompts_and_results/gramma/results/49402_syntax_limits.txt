In the current situation, the Bandit has already attacked the Merchant and taken the Medicine. The Bandit is now in a position to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Merchant is dead, the Bandit can loot the Merchant's coins.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)** - The Bandit loots the coins from the Merchant's corpse.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire the coins she desires without needing to engage in further conflict or risk. By looting the Merchant, she achieves her goal of carrying more coins.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)"]
}
```
