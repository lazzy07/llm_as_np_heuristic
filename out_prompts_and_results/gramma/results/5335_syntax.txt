To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, we need to ensure that she can sell her medicine to Tom while avoiding any criminal activity. The Merchant is currently at the Crossroads, and Tom is at the Market, where he believes the medicine is located. The Bandit is also at the Market, which poses a potential threat to Tom.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the Merchant achieving her goal:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks to the Market to sell her medicine to Tom, as he is currently there and believes she has the medicine.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant using one of his coins. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without engaging in any criminal activity.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: After the transaction, the Merchant walks back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for her to be in a safe location away from the Bandit.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully sold her medicine and gained a coin, achieving her goal without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: This action is necessary for the Merchant to reach Tom and sell her medicine.
- **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin legally, fulfilling her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal behavior.
- **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: This action ensures the Merchant returns to a safe location after the transaction, maintaining her non-criminal status.
