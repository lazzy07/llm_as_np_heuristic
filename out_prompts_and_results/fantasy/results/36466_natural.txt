To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince needs to be at the cave to interact with Talia and Rory, and he has the money that Rory wants.

2. **Vince proposes to Talia.**  
   - This action is included because Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, and Vince's proposal is a way to solidify their relationship, which can lead to Rory's happiness.

3. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**  
   - Talia accepts the proposal, which is necessary for the marriage to take place and for Rory to feel secure in his relationship with Talia.

4. **Vince and Talia get married.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Talia's happiness is maximized, which indirectly contributes to Rory's happiness as well.

5. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action is included because it allows Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth and not hunger, while Rory's death will not affect his happiness since he is already married to Talia.

6. **Vince takes the money from Rory's dead body.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to gain wealth, which is part of Rory's goal of being wealthy.

7. **Vince picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Vince to gain more wealth, which contributes to Rory's overall goal of being wealthy.

At the end of these actions, Rory is happy because he is married to Talia, and Vince has gained wealth, which indirectly supports Rory's goal of being wealthy.
