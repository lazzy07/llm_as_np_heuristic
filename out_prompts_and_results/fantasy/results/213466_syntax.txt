To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness. The next step is to acquire wealth, which can be done by obtaining the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the cave to the village to be with Talia and Vince, as he needs to strategize on how to get the treasure.
2. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave to retrieve the treasure.
3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, which will increase his wealth.

After these actions, Rory will have the treasure, thus achieving his goal of being wealthy. He is already happy due to his marriage to Talia, and he is not hungry.
