Zoe stands on the dangerous surface of the planet, aware of the erupting volcano nearby. She knows that both she and the Lizard need to be safe and healthy, and she wants to make friends with the Lizard. To achieve this, Zoe decides to take a peaceful approach.

**Action:** Zoe walks towards the Lizard and extends her hand in friendship.

**Explanation:** This action is chosen because Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, and since they are not fighting, this is the best way to establish a relationship. By walking towards the Lizard and offering friendship, Zoe demonstrates her intention to connect rather than confront, which aligns with both characters' goals of safety and health.

After this action, the Lizard, seeing Zoe's friendly gesture, reciprocates and they both agree to work together to find a safe place away from the erupting volcano. They become friends, ensuring that both characters achieve their goals of safety and companionship.
