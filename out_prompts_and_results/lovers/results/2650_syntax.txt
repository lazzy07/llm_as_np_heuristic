To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story and keep Alex in the same room as Casey and Blake.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to themselves, which is a way to signify that they now possess the item they want. This action is a bit unconventional but serves to confirm that Alex has achieved their goal.
