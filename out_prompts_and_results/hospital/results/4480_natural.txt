**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she prioritizes Jones's health. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** 
   - This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. Treating him with antibiotics will ensure he becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. She then turns her attention to Ross, who is still in the admissions room and has an unknown condition.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's condition is unknown, Hathaway needs to assess him to provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**
   - Assuming that Ross has a rash (the only symptom left unaccounted for), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway's workload is now at 1, and she can focus on Young.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, which are still unknown.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**
   - Assuming Young also has a rash, Hathaway treats him with steroids, ensuring he becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are treated successfully, and Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients based on their symptoms. The sequence ensures that all patients are treated correctly without exceeding the workload that could lead to mistakes.
