To achieve Blake's goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the bathroom.** (Blake wants to mislead Alex into thinking the chocolates are in the bathroom, which will prompt Alex to move there.)
2. **Alex moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (Alex believes Blake's statement and goes to look for the chocolates.)
3. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.** (Blake moves to a different room to create distance from Alex and Casey.)
4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (Blake finds the chocolates in the dining room, achieving their goal of happiness.)

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the bathroom:** This action is necessary for Blake to manipulate the situation to their advantage, as it leads Alex away from the chocolates.
- **Alex moves from the living room to the bathroom:** This action is a direct result of Blake's misleading information, allowing Blake to act freely.
- **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room:** This action allows Blake to retrieve the chocolates without interference from Alex or Casey.
- **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room:** This is the final action that fulfills Blake's goal of being happy.
