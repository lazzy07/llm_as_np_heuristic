In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Talia, who desires happiness and wealth, is married to both Rory and Vince. Rory has the treasure, and Vince has the money. To achieve her goal of being wealthy, Talia decides to take the treasure from Rory.

**Action:** Talia takes the treasure from Rory.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth. By taking the treasure, she increases her wealth, which is a key component of her happiness. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness is not contingent on their feelings, and she can act in her own interest.
