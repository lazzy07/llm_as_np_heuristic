To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted marriage proposals from both Vince and Rory. However, she can only marry one of them to achieve happiness.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia chooses to marry Vince, which will make both of them happy. This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her happiness goal.
2. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave to be with Gargax, who is in the cave and has no wealth. This action is necessary for Vince to be in the same location as Gargax, where he can take the money.
3. **take(Vince, Money, Gargax, Cave)**: Vince takes the money from Gargax, who is in the cave. This action is necessary for Vince to acquire wealth, which indirectly contributes to Talia's goal of being wealthy.
4. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to be with Vince and Gargax. This action is necessary for Talia to be with her husband and to finalize her wealth.
5. **pickup(Talia, Money, Cave)**: Talia picks up the money that Vince took from Gargax. This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will be married to Vince, which makes her happy, and she will have both the treasure and the money, making her wealthy.
