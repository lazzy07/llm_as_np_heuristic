As the day progressed, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realized he had to act quickly. He had the knife, and the bully was a threat to both him and Ernest. With a surge of determination, Roy decided to take revenge. He approached the bully, who was unaware of the danger he was in. In a swift motion, Roy used the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest would no longer be threatened.

Knowing that Ernest was still in the cells and threatened, Roy unlocked the gym door and made his way to the hallway. He crawled through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once there, he put on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise and successfully escaped from the prison.
