To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will then assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated correctly.

6. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
