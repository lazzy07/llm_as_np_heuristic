In the current situation, the US Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead after opening it. Indiana Jones is alive and in the USA. To ensure the US Army retains possession of the Ark and the Nazis remain dead, the following action is taken:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, USA)**: The US Army, already armed and in possession of the Ark, takes the Ark from the Nazis, who are dead after opening it. This action solidifies the US Army's control over the Ark and ensures that the Nazis cannot reclaim it.

This action is necessary because it confirms the US Army's ownership of the Ark while ensuring that the Nazis, who sought immortality through the Ark, are no longer a threat.

The final story is as follows: The US Army, having already killed the Nazis when they opened the Ark, now takes the Ark from the dead Nazis, ensuring that it remains in their possession.
