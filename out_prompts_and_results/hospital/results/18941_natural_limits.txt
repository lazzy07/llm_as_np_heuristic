Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway's workload remains at 2, and he does not make a mistake. After assessing, Hathaway realizes that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C.
