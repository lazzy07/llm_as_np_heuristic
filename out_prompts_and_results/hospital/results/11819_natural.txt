**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being 2, which is below the threshold for making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition. As a result, Jones does not become healthy and dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross. He admits Ross to Patient Room B and then assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Again, due to the workload being 2, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young. He admits Young to Patient Room C and assesses him. Young is experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being 2. He treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition. Young does not become healthy and dies.

In the end, only Ross is healthy, while Jones and Young have died. Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is not fully achieved, but he does manage to save Ross.
