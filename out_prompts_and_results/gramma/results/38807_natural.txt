To achieve the merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant attacks the bandit.** This action is taken because the merchant is armed and can eliminate the bandit, who is a criminal. By doing this, the merchant can secure the bandit's coin and prevent any further threats to her business.

2. **The merchant loots the bandit's coin from the bandit's corpse.** After successfully attacking and killing the bandit, the merchant can now take the coin that the bandit was carrying. This increases her total coins without committing any criminal acts.

3. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.** The merchant will then leave the market, where the danger was, and head towards the crossroads, a safer location.

4. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** Finally, the merchant will walk to the cottage, where she can safely store her coins and the medicine she has.

This sequence of actions ensures that the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins while remaining within the bounds of legality.
