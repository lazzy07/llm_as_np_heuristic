To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi is a potential target.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to obtain food, which will satisfy his hunger, and also allows him to eat Bambi, which is a means to survive.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a prerequisite for him to feel fulfilled and potentially motivated to pursue money.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly achieves Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger first, which is essential for his well-being, and then he successfully steals the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
