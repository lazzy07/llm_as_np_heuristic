Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe and healthy, Zoe needs to take actions that will allow them to connect without conflict.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him. The surface is dangerous, but Zoe believes she can handle the situation.

2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes peace.** - Since Zoe and the Lizard are not fighting, this action allows them to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, Zoe can ensure that both she and the Lizard feel safe and healthy.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard discuss their goals and concerns.** - This step is implied in the action of making peace, as it helps both characters understand each other better and solidify their friendship.

4. **Zoe invites the Lizard to join her on the spaceship.** - This action is a way for Zoe to ensure that both she and the Lizard can be safe from the erupting volcano on the surface. It also fosters their friendship by sharing her home with him.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This final action ensures that both characters are safe from the dangers of the surface and allows them to continue their friendship in a secure environment.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are healthy and safe.
