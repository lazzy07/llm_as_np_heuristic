**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is showing a rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Young, who is still waiting there. Dr. Hathaway assigns Young to Patient Room C. After admitting Young, Dr. Hathaway assesses him in Patient Room C. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease. However, since Young is still alive, he can be treated. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, assuming he might have Flaze. Unfortunately, this is a mistake, and Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcome for Young, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
