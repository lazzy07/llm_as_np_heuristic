**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room C, assesses Jones. With a workload of 3, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for the fever symptom of Flaze. As a result, Jones does not become healthy and dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young walks from Admissions to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young, who is experiencing a fever (Flaze). This time, Hathaway correctly identifies the disease and treats Young with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Young**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine the symptoms and provide the correct treatment.
