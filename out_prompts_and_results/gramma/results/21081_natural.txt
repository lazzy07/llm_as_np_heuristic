The bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit already has coins in the chest, she will take actions to ensure she can secure more coins.

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. (This action allows the bandit to access the chest where her coins are stored.)
2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest. (This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.)

The story is complete with these two actions, as they directly lead to the bandit achieving her goal of having coins.
