To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary to move Bubba away from the bank and potentially towards Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money he stole from the clerk, and Bambi will be dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires without needing to engage in a lengthy process of negotiation or persuasion.
- **go**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the bank, where he has just committed theft, to the forest, where Bambi is located.
- **shoot**: This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, which is one of the two possible endings.
