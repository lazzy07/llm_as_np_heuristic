To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Admit Ross to ExamRoomB**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will admit him to ExamRoomB. This is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Ross in ExamRoomB**: Hathaway will then assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify his condition and provide the appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
