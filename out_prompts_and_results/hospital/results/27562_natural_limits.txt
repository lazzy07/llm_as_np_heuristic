Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the assessment reveals that Jones has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which makes Jones healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to and to reduce the workload.
