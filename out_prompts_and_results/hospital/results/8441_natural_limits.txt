Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Young and confirms that Young is experiencing Fever, which indicates that Young has Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, they can treat Young without making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Young becomes healthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to confirm the symptoms (Fever).
2. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young of Flaze.

Each action is necessary to ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. The assessment confirms the disease, and the treatment directly addresses the confirmed disease, leading to Young's recovery.
