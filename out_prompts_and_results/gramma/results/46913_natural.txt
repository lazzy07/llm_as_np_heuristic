The bandit, having successfully looted the medicine from the merchant, now seeks to maximize her coins. She knows that the guard is a threat to her plans, so she decides to take action to eliminate him.

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the guard, who poses a threat to her freedom and ability to carry coins. Since the guard is not armed, the bandit can successfully attack him.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's sword.** After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit loots his sword. This action is important as it gives her an additional weapon, which can be useful for future encounters or to defend herself.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** With the guard eliminated and the sword in her possession, the bandit walks back to her camp. This action is necessary for her to secure her coins and the medicine in a safe location.

4. **The bandit places the medicine and the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having as many coins as possible in the chest at the bandit camp, along with the medicine she looted.

By following these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having them secured in the chest at the bandit camp.
