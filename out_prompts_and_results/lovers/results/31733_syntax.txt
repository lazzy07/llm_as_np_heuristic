To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C2) in the dining room (R12). This action is important because it helps Casey to be happy, which in turn aligns with Blake's goal of making Alex happy, as Casey wants Blake to be happy.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R12)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I2) with Blake for the chocolates (I3) in the dining room (R12). This is the crucial action that allows Blake to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to conclude the interaction in a different room.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex and Casey to interact.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: By giving flowers to Casey, Blake ensures Casey is happy, which is part of the interconnected happiness among the characters.
- **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R12)**: This is the key action that allows Blake to get the jewelry, making Blake happy.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room, concluding the interaction.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2).
