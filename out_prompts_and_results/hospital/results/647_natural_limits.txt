Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients currently in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess them properly. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** This action allows Hathaway to begin assessing Jones, who is currently in Patient Room A.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.** This action allows Hathaway to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** Similar to Jones, Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.** This action allows Hathaway to assess Young, who is in Patient Room C.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has assessed all patients, but due to the Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the diseases. However, since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway decides to treat all patients with the antibiotics for Flaze, as it is the only treatment available that could potentially help.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.** This action is taken under the assumption that Jones might have Flaze. If Jones has Flaze, he will become healthy.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** This action is taken under the same assumption for Ross.

Since all patients were treated with antibiotics, they all become healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
