To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he has just eaten Bambi and head to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal of having the money, while Bambi remains dead from the earlier events.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten, to the bank, where he can confront the clerk and attempt to steal the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk using the threat of his loaded rifle, fulfilling his goal of acquiring money.
