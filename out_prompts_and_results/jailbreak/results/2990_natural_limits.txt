**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym and that he has the knife. He quickly crawls through the vents to the gym, where he finds the bully trapped inside. With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation, kills him. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He then remembers the civilian clothes in the laundry room.
