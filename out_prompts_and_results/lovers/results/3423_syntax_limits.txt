In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) that is currently with Casey (C2), but Alex is not happy yet. Casey is happy with the chocolates (I2) that Blake (C3) gave her, and Blake is happy with the flowers (I3) he received from Casey. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action would be for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item he wants, making him happy.

After this action, Alex will have the jewelry he wants, thus achieving his goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
