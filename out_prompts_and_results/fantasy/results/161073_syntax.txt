To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory accepts Talia's marriage proposal. This action makes both Rory and Talia happy, which is essential for Rory's goal of happiness.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village. This is necessary for Rory to access the money that is currently with Vince.

3. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince. This action fulfills Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry again, but this is not a concern since Rory has already achieved wealth and happiness.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to conclude the story, as it is the only way to end Rory's journey after achieving their goals.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is crucial for Rory to achieve happiness through marriage.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to go to the village to access the money.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of their primary goals.
- **get_hungry(Rory)**: This action is included to show Rory's state but does not affect the achievement of their goals.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: This action concludes the story, showing the consequences of the characters' actions.
