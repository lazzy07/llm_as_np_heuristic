   - This action is necessary for Zoe to be present on the surface where the Lizard is located, allowing for potential interaction.

2. **Zoe walks to the cave.**  
   - By walking to the cave, Zoe approaches the Lizard directly, which is essential for initiating a conversation and building a relationship.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows both characters to stop any potential fighting and start building a friendship, which is a key goal for both characters.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard leave the cave together to a safe location.**  
   - This action is implied as a result of making peace, ensuring both characters are safe and can continue their friendship away from the dangers of the surface.
