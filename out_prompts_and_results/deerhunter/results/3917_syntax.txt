To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money. After this action, the clerk is dead, and Bubba can take the money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then goes to the forest where Bambi is located. This movement is necessary to reach Bambi, who is his next target.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

By executing these actions, Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk and Bambi is dead.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively meets the requirements of the story by ensuring that Bubba has the money and Bambi is dead.
