**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the locked gym with the bully, he knows he must act quickly. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of the situation. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, continues to boast about his power over the other prisoners. 

In a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully, using the knife to defend himself and his friend Ernest. The bully, taken by surprise, falls to the ground, and Roy feels a rush of adrenaline. He has successfully killed the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he needs to escape. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. 

Now ready, Roy unlocks the gym door and heads to the hallway. He crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes, blending in with the world beyond the prison walls. 

Roy has achieved his goal of being alive and free, no longer threatened by the bully.
