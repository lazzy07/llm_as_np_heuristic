In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all patients are healthy. Given the current situation, the following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if he shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Treat Young**: Since Young is already in Exam Room A and has been assessed with SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can effectively treat both patients and achieve the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
