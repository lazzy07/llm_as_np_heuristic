To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob the Bandit**: Tom will rob the Bandit to take the BanditCoin. This action is necessary because Tom needs coins to buy the medicine from the Merchant. Since the Bandit is armed and Tom is also armed, this action is valid.

2. **Buy the Medicine**: After robbing the Bandit, Tom will have enough coins to buy the medicine from the Merchant. This is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

3. **Walk to the Cottage**: Finally, Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Tom, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: Tom robs the Bandit to take the BanditCoin. This is necessary for Tom to have the coins needed to buy the medicine.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: Tom uses the BanditCoin he just acquired to buy the medicine from the Merchant. This is crucial for Tom to fulfill his goal of carrying the medicine.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks to the Cottage, which is his ultimate goal.

After these actions, Tom will be at the Cottage carrying the medicine, achieving his goal.
