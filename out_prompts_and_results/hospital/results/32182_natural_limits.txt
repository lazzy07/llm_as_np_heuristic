Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis (the rash) instead of Flaze (the fever). 

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Based on the incorrect assessment, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the treatment for Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess and admit Jones and Ross, who are both still waiting. 

In this scenario, Dr. Hathaway's actions lead to a tragic outcome for Young, but they are necessary to reduce the workload and continue the process of treating the remaining patients. The story is short and direct, focusing on the actions that lead to the conclusion of the situation.
