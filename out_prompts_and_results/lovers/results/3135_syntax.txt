To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom (R11) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially trade or give items.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This is a strategic move to communicate their desire and potentially influence Casey's actions.

3. **put_down(C2, I3, R12)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I3) in the dining room. This action is necessary because it clears Casey's hands and allows for a potential trade or gift exchange.

4. **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I3) that Casey just put down. This is a way for Alex to acquire an item that they can use to negotiate or trade.

5. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R11) with the chocolates. This is necessary to position Alex in a room where they can interact with Blake.

6. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R11) to follow Alex. This is important for Casey to be present for the next action.

7. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R11)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I3) for the flowers (I1) with Casey in the bedroom. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making them happy.
