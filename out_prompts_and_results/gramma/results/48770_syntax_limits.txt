To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. Since he has already purchased the medicine and is now at the Crossroads, he can simply walk to the cottage to fulfill his goal.

This action is sufficient because it directly leads Tom to his desired location with the medicine he has.
