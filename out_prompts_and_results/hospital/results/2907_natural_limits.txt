Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms. Since her workload is at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she must act quickly to help the patients.

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and provide treatment.

2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. Since Ross actually has Jarkis (as indicated by the unknown symptoms), he dies. This action is necessary to attempt to help Ross, even though it results in a negative outcome.

3. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Jones. This action is necessary to continue her efforts to help the remaining patients.

4. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition and provide treatment.

5. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics. Since Jones actually has Jarkis, he dies as well. This action is necessary to attempt to help Jones, even though it results in a negative outcome.

6. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. This action is necessary to continue her efforts to help the last patient.

7. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and provide treatment.

8. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. Since Young actually has Jarkis, he dies as well. This action is necessary to attempt to help Young, even though it results in a negative outcome.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is not achieved, as all patients die due to her mistakes caused by her high workload. However, she attempted to help each patient, which aligns with her goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy.
