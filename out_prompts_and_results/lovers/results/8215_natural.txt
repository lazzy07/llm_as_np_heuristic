To complete the story and ensure that Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - Blake wants the chocolates, so this action helps him achieve his goal.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to return to the living room to interact with Casey and Alex.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and by giving the chocolates to Casey, Blake can facilitate a trade.

5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the chocolates, which she wants, while Blake receives the jewelry.

6. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - Blake needs to go back to the dining room to give the flowers to Alex.

7. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.
