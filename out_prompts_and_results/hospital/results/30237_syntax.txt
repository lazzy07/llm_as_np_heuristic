To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Since Ross has been admitted to both Exam Room A and Exam Room B, Hathaway will assess him again in Exam Room B. This is redundant but necessary to ensure that Hathaway has the correct information about Ross's symptoms.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

5. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

6. **Walk Jones from Admissions to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will walk him to Exam Room A to assess him.

7. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

8. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
