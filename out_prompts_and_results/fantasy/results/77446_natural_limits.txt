In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. The current situation is that Talia has the money, and the treasure is at the cave. Since Talia and Rory are already married, Rory's happiness can be achieved through Talia's actions.

To achieve Rory's goal, Talia can travel to the cave, pick up the treasure, and then give it to Rory. This will make Rory wealthy and happy, as he will have the treasure and the love of Talia.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Talia travels from the village to the cave. (This is necessary for Talia to access the treasure.)
2. Talia picks up the treasure at the cave. (This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure that Rory needs to be wealthy.)
3. Talia travels back to the village. (This is necessary for Talia to return to Rory with the treasure.)
4. Talia gives the treasure to Rory. (This action fulfills Rory's need to be wealthy and, combined with their marriage, makes him happy.)

Now, Rory is wealthy and happy, achieving his goal.
