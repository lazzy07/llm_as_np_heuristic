To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in PatientRoomA, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB. This is important to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Admissions. This is crucial to identify Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This is vital to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
