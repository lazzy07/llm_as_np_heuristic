To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to be in a location where she can potentially interact with the guard, who is at the market.

2. **The bandit reports her location to the guard.**  
   - The bandit, wanting to distract the guard from the merchant, reports her location. This action is strategic as it keeps the guard occupied and away from the merchant's activities.

3. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant moves to the crossroads to meet the hero and potentially trade or acquire more coins.

4. **The merchant buys the hero's medicine for the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain a coin while providing the hero with the medicine he desires. The merchant's goal is to maximize her coins without engaging in criminal activity.

5. **The merchant walks back to the market.**  
   - The merchant returns to the market, where she can continue her business and potentially sell the medicine or trade for more coins.

At the end of these actions, the merchant has successfully acquired a coin from the hero without committing any crimes, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The banditâ€™s actions are designed to create a diversion, allowing the merchant to operate freely.
- The merchant's movement to the crossroads and subsequent purchase from the hero is a legitimate transaction that increases her coin count.
- The final movement back to the market positions the merchant to continue her business.
