After admitting Ross and Jones to their respective exam rooms, Hathaway decides to assess Ross first, as he is currently in Exam Room A.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it ensures Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Young, who is still waiting. Since Young has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.
