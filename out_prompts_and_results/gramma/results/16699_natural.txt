**Story Completion:**

The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the merchant has the medicine, which she can use to further her own goals. 

1. The bandit attacks the merchant. (This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the merchant and take the medicine, which is crucial for her plans.)
2. The bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse. (This action allows the bandit to acquire the medicine, which she can use to either sell or trade for more coins.)
3. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. (This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her safe haven with her newly acquired items.)

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can and now possesses the medicine as well.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The attack on the merchant was essential for the bandit to eliminate a potential threat and gain the medicine.
- Looting the medicine from the merchant's corpse was the direct result of the attack, allowing the bandit to fulfill her goal of acquiring valuable items.
- Walking back to the bandit camp ensures the bandit is safe and can store her loot, including the hero's coin and the medicine.
