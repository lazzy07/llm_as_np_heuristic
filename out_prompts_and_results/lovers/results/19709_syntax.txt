To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to this outcome:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R12)**: Casey (C3) will trade the chocolates (I1) they have with Alex (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates (I1) and will be unhappy because they wanted the flowers (I2).
- Blake will still have the flowers (I2) and will be unhappy because they wanted the jewelry (I3).
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy because they have the item they wanted.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R12)**: This action allows Casey to get the jewelry they want by trading the chocolates they have with Alex.

At the end of this action, Casey is happy, achieving their goal.
