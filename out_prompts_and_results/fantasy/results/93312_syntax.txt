To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions that will lead her to acquire the treasure and maintain her happiness. Since Talia is already married to Vince, her happiness is somewhat secured through their relationship. However, she still needs to acquire the treasure to fulfill her desire for wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Talia needs to go to the cave where the treasure is located.
2. **Pickup Treasure**: Once in the cave, Talia can pick up the treasure, which will increase her wealth.
3. **Travel from Cave to Village**: After acquiring the treasure, Talia will return to the village.
4. **Marry Vince**: Since Talia is already married to Vince, this action is not necessary again, but it confirms their relationship and her happiness.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to reach the location of the treasure.
2. **Pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which is essential for her to achieve her goal of wealth.
3. **Travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia needs to return to the village after picking up the treasure to ensure she is in a safe location with her husband.
4. **Marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action is not needed again since they are already married, but it reinforces Talia's happiness through her relationship with Vince.

After these actions, Talia will have both happiness (from her marriage) and wealth (from the treasure), thus achieving her goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Talia, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)",
    "travel(Talia, Cave, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy in the shortest possible way.
