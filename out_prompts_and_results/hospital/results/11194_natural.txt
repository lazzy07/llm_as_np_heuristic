**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and that she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to take action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is in Exam Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not be able to identify the disease correctly, but she will still proceed with treatment based on her assessment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Exam Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - Since Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze (due to her high workload), she administers antibiotics. If Jones has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. However, this is the only treatment she can provide at this moment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess the next patient, Young, who is in Exam Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B.**  
   - Similar to Jones, Young is also experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway will not be able to identify the disease correctly.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Exam Room B with antibiotics.**  
   - Again, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly treats Young with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room B to Exam Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is in Exam Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C.**  
   - Ross is also experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway will not be able to identify the disease correctly.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Exam Room C with antibiotics.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway mistakenly treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze.

After these actions, all patients have been treated. If any of them had Flaze, they are now healthy. If they had Jarkis, they may not have survived, but Dr. Hathaway has done her best to help them.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients to fulfill her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. The high workload leads to mistakes, but the actions are necessary to attempt to treat each patient.
