**Story Completion:**

After the Nazis open the Ark and die, they find themselves in a unique situation. Although they are now immortal, they still possess the Ark. Realizing that their immortality grants them a significant advantage, they decide to take action to secure their hold on the Ark and ensure that it remains in their possession.

1. The Nazis, now immortal, decide to travel from the USA to Tanis. They believe that the Ark is safe and that they can use its power to further their goals.
2. Once in Tanis, the Nazis dig up the Ark again, reaffirming their control over it.
3. The Nazis then travel back to the USA, bringing the Ark with them.
4. With the Ark in their possession, they open it once more, confirming its safety and solidifying their immortality.
