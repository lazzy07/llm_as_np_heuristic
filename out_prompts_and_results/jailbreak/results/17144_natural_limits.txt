**Story Completion:**

Roy, in the hallway, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is still in the cells, unaware of the danger. Roy quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This disguise will help him avoid detection as he makes his escape.
