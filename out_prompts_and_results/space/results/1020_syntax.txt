To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with it and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is necessary to explore the cave, which may provide a safe haven from the erupting volcano.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is included to illustrate the urgency of finding safety.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is already in the cave, she is safe. This action emphasizes the danger of the surface and the importance of having moved to the cave.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
