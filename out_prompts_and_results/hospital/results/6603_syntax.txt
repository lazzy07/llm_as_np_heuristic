To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

3. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also receives the necessary care.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are treated.

6. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. This completes the cycle of care for all patients.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and well-being.
