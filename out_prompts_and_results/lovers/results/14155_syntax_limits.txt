In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) has item I1, and both Alex and Blake (C2) want Casey to be happy, who in turn wants item I3 (chocolates) to be happy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake remains unhappy as well, but Alex has achieved their goal.

The story is complete with just this one action, as it directly leads to Alex's happiness.
