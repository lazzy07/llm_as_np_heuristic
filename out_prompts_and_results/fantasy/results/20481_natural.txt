To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Talia proposes to Rory**: Talia wants to be happy, and marrying Rory will contribute to her happiness. 
2. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: This action will make both Talia and Rory happy.
3. **Talia and Rory get married**: This solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.
4. **Talia gives the treasure to Gargax**: Talia wants to be wealthy, and since Gargax is a dragon who desires wealth, she can trade the treasure for money.
5. **Gargax gives Talia money in exchange for the treasure**: This action fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Proposing and accepting marriage**: These actions are necessary for Talia to achieve happiness through a loving relationship with Rory.
- **Getting married**: This finalizes the relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness.
- **Trading the treasure for money**: This action allows Talia to achieve her goal of wealth, as Gargax is willing to exchange money for the treasure.

Here’s the complete story with the actions:

1. Talia proposes to Rory.
2. Rory accepts Talia's proposal.
3. Talia and Rory get married.
4. Talia gives the treasure to Gargax.
5. Gargax gives Talia money in exchange for the treasure.

At the end of these actions, Talia is happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to receiving money from Gargax).
