Tom is at the market, armed with a sword, and he knows that the medicine he wants is with the merchant. The bandit is also at the market, and while she is a criminal, Tom is not. To achieve his goal of getting the medicine and returning to the cottage, Tom decides to take action.

1. **Rob the Merchant**: Tom uses his sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine from her. This action is necessary because it allows Tom to acquire the medicine he desires without needing to pay for it, which would require coins he does not have.

2. **Walk to the Cottage**: After successfully robbing the merchant, Tom walks back to the cottage. This action is essential for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

With these two actions, Tom successfully obtains the medicine and returns to the cottage, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Rob(Merchant)**: This action is taken because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal, and since he is armed, he can rob the merchant without facing any consequences from her.
- **Walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, after acquiring the medicine.
