Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make a connection with the Lizard to ensure both their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** This action is necessary for Zoe to initiate a conversation and establish a relationship with the Lizard, as they are currently not fighting and can potentially become friends.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can set aside their differences and work together to escape the danger posed by the erupting volcano. This action is crucial for achieving their mutual goal of safety and friendship.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event is a natural consequence of the story's setting and serves as a climax. It creates urgency and reinforces the need for Zoe and the Lizard to cooperate.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** This action is taken to escape the erupting volcano. Since they have made peace, they can now work together to ensure their safety.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** This final action solidifies their relationship, ensuring that they can support each other in future endeavors.

In this sequence, the story ends with the volcano erupting, but both characters escape to safety and become friends, achieving their goals of health, safety, and friendship.
