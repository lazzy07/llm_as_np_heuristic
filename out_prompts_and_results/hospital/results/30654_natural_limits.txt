Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, decides to assess Ross, who is in the same room. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross is experiencing a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Young, who is also waiting there. This action is not necessary for Ross's immediate goal but is part of the hospital's workflow to ensure all patients are attended to.

The actions taken are as follows:
1. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms.
2. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, curing him of Flaze.
3. Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Young, ensuring the hospital continues to function smoothly.

In this story, Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy through the correct assessment and treatment by Dr. Hathaway.
