To achieve the goal of having Bubba end up with the money or ensuring Bambi is dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will decide to steal the money from the bank clerk. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to intimidate the clerk into giving up the money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house, where he can safely keep the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the money from the clerk. The loaded rifle gives him the power to successfully execute this action without resistance from the clerk.
  
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe location, ensuring that he has the money and is not caught immediately after the theft.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, House)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while also fulfilling the requirement of the story.
