**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest realizes he needs to escape the prison to ensure his safety and to enjoy his pack of cigarettes without the threat of the bully. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife with him, which gives him a chance to confront the bully if necessary. However, he decides that the best course of action is to avoid confrontation and escape instead.

Ernest moves to the hallway, where he can access the vents. He crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he is on the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself to avoid being recognized as a prisoner. With the disguise on, he successfully escapes from the prison, leaving behind the threats and dangers of prison life.
