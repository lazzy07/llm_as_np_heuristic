To complete the story while ensuring Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess Jones to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze (due to the workload), this treatment will either make Jones healthy or lead to a fatal mistake. However, since Jones is alive, we will assume that Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies the treatment needed.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to admit Ross, who is still in Admissions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition as Jarkis, this treatment will make Ross healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young, who is in Patient Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's condition as Flaze, this treatment will make Young healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
