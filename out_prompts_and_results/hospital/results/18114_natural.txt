**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room A, assesses Jones. With a workload of 3, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for Flaze. As a result, Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Ross is then assessed by Hathaway, who, still at a workload of 2, correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions again to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is assessed and, with a workload of 2, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze instead of Jarkis. Young is treated with antibiotics, which is incorrect for Jarkis, and Young dies.

In the end, only Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, while Jones and Young do not.
