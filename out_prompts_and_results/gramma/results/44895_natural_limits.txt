The bandit, armed with both the bandit's sword and the merchant's sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She approaches the merchant, who is currently unarmed and has the medicine that Tom desires. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the medicine from her. With this action, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she now has the medicine that can be sold for coins later.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit robs the merchant: This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying valuable items (the medicine) that can be converted into coins later. Since the merchant is unarmed, the bandit can successfully take the medicine without any risk of retaliation.
