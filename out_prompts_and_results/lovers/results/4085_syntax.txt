To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to give to Casey in order to make a trade.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary to interact with Casey and facilitate the trade.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to initiate a trade with Casey, who has the jewelry that Alex wants.

5. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) with Alex for the chocolates (I2). This is the final action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1), which means Alex is happy.
