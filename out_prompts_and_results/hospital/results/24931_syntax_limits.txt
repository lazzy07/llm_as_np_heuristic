In this story, Young is in Patient Room B and wants to be alive and healthy. To achieve this, Young needs to be assessed by Dr. Hathaway and treated based on the symptoms they exhibit. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can safely assess and treat Young without making a mistake.

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B to determine if they have Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure Young receives the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them based on the identified symptoms. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

By following these two actions, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
