To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** (Talia needs to be at the cave to interact with Gargax and potentially negotiate for wealth.)
2. **Talia proposes to Gargax.** (Talia wants to be wealthy, and Gargax is a dragon who desires wealth. This proposal could lead to a mutually beneficial arrangement.)
3. **Gargax accepts the proposal.** (Gargax, wanting to be wealthy, sees the benefit in marrying Talia, who has treasure.)
4. **Talia and Gargax get married.** (This marriage will make Talia happy and could lead to her becoming wealthy through Gargax's resources.)
5. **Gargax gives Talia the money.** (This action fulfills Talia's goal of being wealthy, as Gargax has no interest in happiness but wants to share wealth.)

Now, Talia is married to Gargax, has the treasure, and has received money, achieving her goal of being happy and wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave** allows Talia to interact with Gargax, who is the key to her wealth.
- **Proposing to Gargax** is a strategic move since Gargax desires wealth and does not care about happiness, making him a suitable partner for Talia.
- **Gargax accepting the proposal** is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of happiness through marriage.
- **Getting married** solidifies their partnership, aligning their goals.
- **Receiving money from Gargax** directly fulfills Talia's desire to be wealthy.
