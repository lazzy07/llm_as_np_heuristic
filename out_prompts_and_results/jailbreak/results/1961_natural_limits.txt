**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he needs to help Ernest. He knows that the bully is threatening both of them and that Ernest is in the laundry room with the cigarettes. 

Roy decides to take action. He crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, he locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. 

With the bully locked in, Roy then retrieves the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously planned to use for protection. He returns to the gym, confronts the bully, and kills him, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

Now that the bully is dead, Roy can safely return to the laundry room to reunite with Ernest. They can now plan their escape together.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Crawl through the vents to the gym**: This action allows Roy to access the gym without being seen by the bully, ensuring he can lock the door and trap the bully.
2. **Lock the gym door**: This secures the bully inside, preventing him from threatening either Roy or Ernest.
3. **Retrieve the knife from the kitchen**: This action is necessary for Roy to defend himself and eliminate the threat posed by the bully.
4. **Confront and kill the bully**: This is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer in danger, allowing them to plan their escape.
