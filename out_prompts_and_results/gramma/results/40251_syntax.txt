To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the Bandit prefers to be at the camp to achieve her goal of accumulating coins.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action directly fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins.

The story is short and straightforward because the Bandit has already acquired the medicine from Tom and has successfully robbed the Merchant of the coin. Now, she simply needs to secure her coins in the camp.
