Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both his needs. He is at the bank, where he knows the clerk has money. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk, killing him. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money he desires, as the clerk is the only one with money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his greed and allows him to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully satisfies his greed by obtaining the money he wanted.
