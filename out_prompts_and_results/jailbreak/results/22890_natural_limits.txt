Ernest, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to survive. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of his decision. With a surge of adrenaline, he lunges at the bully, using the knife to defend himself. The bully, caught off guard, is unable to react in time, and Ernest successfully kills him. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now escape the gym. He unlocks the door and makes his way to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he had previously stolen. Once disguised, he sneaks out through the hallway and crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. 

Finally, wearing the civilian clothes, Ernest escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
