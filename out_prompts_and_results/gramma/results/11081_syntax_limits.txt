To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and knows that the medicine is with the Merchant at the Market. He needs to go to the Market to acquire the medicine.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Once Tom reaches the Market, he can buy the medicine from the Merchant using one of the coins he is carrying. This action allows Tom to fulfill his goal of carrying the medicine.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom will walk back to the Crossroads.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

The actions are necessary to ensure that Tom successfully acquires the medicine and reaches the Cottage. The first action is essential for Tom to reach the Merchant, the second action is crucial for him to obtain the medicine, and the last two actions are required for him to return to the Cottage.
