To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake wants the chocolates, and it allows him to have an item that he desires.

2. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey, facilitating interaction.

3. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action is crucial because it allows Alex to receive the chocolates, which he can then trade for the flowers.

4. **Alex puts down the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Alex to have an item to trade. Since Alex is currently holding the jewelry, he needs to put it down to facilitate the trade.

5. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to finally obtain the flowers, which is his goal.

6. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the jewelry, which he can now have as a desired item.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because he has the flowers, Blake is happy because he has the jewelry, and Casey remains happy with the jewelry.
