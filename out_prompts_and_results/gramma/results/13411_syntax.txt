To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation with the bandit and the guard. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is implied as part of Tom's goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage, which he now has.

The story is straightforward because Tom has already acquired the medicine and is in a position to walk directly to the cottage without any conflict. The bandit and the guard are at the market, and the merchant is also there, so there are no immediate threats to Tom as he moves to the cottage.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "use(Medicine)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential for Tom to reach his goal of being at the cottage.
- **use(Medicine)**: This action signifies that Tom has successfully completed his goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage, even though it is implied rather than explicitly stated in the actions. 

This sequence ensures that Tom achieves his goal efficiently and without conflict.
