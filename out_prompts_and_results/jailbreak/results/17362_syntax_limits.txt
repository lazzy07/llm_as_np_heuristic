Ernest is currently on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes, and he wants to escape the prison. Since he is already on the highway and wearing the disguise, he can simply take the action to escape.

**Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)**

This action is included because it directly fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free, as he is already in the right location and has the necessary disguise.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["escape(Ernest, Highway)"]
}
```
