To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the village, and Rory is at the cave. The treasure is at the cave, and Vince has the money but is dead. Gargax is at the village and is hungry.

### Actions to Achieve the Goal:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and wants to eat a human. By eating Talia, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and Talia will no longer be alive. However, this action will also lead to Talia's happiness being affected, as she will not be alive to feel happiness.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: Since Vince is dead and has the money, Gargax can take the money. This action will increase Gargax's wealth, but it does not directly affect Talia's happiness or wealth.

3. **Rory travels from the cave to the village**: Rory will travel to the village to be with Talia. However, since Talia is no longer alive, this action will not lead to Talia's happiness.

4. **Rory proposes to Gargax**: Rory, wanting to be happy and wealthy, proposes to Gargax. This action is necessary for Rory to seek happiness through a new relationship.

5. **Gargax accepts Rory's proposal**: Gargax accepts the proposal, leading to both characters being happy. This action does not directly affect Talia's happiness or wealth but fulfills Rory's goal.

6. **Rory and Gargax get married**: This final action solidifies the relationship between Rory and Gargax, making both of them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Gargax eating Talia is a necessary action to fulfill Gargax's hunger, which is a primary goal for him.
- Gargax taking the money from Vince's body is a logical step since he wants to be wealthy.
- Rory traveling to the village is an attempt to connect with Talia, but it becomes irrelevant since Talia is no longer alive.
- Rory proposing to Gargax is a strategic move to find happiness after losing Talia.
- Gargax accepting the proposal and their subsequent marriage fulfills both characters' desires for happiness.

### Final Outcome:
Talia does not become happy or wealthy due to her death, but the story concludes with Rory and Gargax achieving their goals.
