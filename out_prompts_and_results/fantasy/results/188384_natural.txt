To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and Rory needs to acquire it to achieve wealth.

2. **Vince gives the money to Rory.**  
   - This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy. Since Vince is at the cave, he can give the money directly to Rory.

3. **Rory picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Rory to gain additional wealth, further contributing to his goal of being wealthy.

4. **Rory and Talia travel from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to return to the village, where he can enjoy his wealth and happiness with Talia.

5. **Rory and Talia become hungry.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger is addressed, as he wants to be not hungry.

6. **Talia picks up food in the village.**  
   - This action allows Talia to gather food, which will help both her and Rory satisfy their hunger.

7. **Rory eats the food.**  
   - This action ensures that Rory is no longer hungry, fulfilling his goal of not being hungry.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goals of being happy (due to his marriage with Talia), wealthy (by acquiring the money and treasure), and not hungry (by eating food).
