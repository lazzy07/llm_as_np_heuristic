**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy realized the danger he and Ernest were in due to the bully's threats. He decided to take action. 

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** This action allows Roy to get closer to the gym where the bully is, while also providing an opportunity to escape if needed.
   
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** This action allows Roy to sneak up on the bully without being seen, reducing the risk of confrontation.

3. **Roy locks the gym door.** By locking the door, Roy ensures that the bully cannot escape and that he has the upper hand in this confrontation.

4. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** This action gives Roy a means to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.

5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** This final action ensures that the bully can no longer threaten either Roy or Ernest, allowing Roy to feel safe and secure.

With the bully gone, Roy can now focus on his own survival and the possibility of sharing the pack of cigarettes with Ernest without fear of retribution.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure Roy's safety and to eliminate the threat posed by the bully. Moving to the hallway and crawling through the vents allows for stealthy movement, while locking the gym door prevents the bully from escaping. Finally, acquiring the knife and using it to kill the bully directly addresses the threat, allowing Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free from intimidation.
