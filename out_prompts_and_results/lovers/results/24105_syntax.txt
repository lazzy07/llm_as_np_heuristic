2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) that were put down in the dining room. This is necessary because Casey needs to have the item they want to be happy.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is necessary for Alex to receive the item they want, which is the jewelry.
