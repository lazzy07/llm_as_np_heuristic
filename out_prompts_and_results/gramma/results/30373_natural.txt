**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, who is at the cottage, walks to the crossroads. (This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the market where the guard is located, allowing her to potentially interact with the guard or the hero.)
   
2. The bandit then walks to the market. (This action allows the bandit to be in a location where she can potentially find the hero or the guard, and it is a step towards achieving her goal of acquiring coins.)

3. The bandit sees the guard at the market and decides to rob him. (The bandit is armed and can rob the guard, who is not armed, allowing her to take one of the guard's items.)

4. The bandit successfully robs the guard and takes the guard's sword. (This action gives the bandit an additional weapon, increasing her power and ability to defend herself or attack others.)

5. The bandit then walks back to the crossroads. (This action allows her to return to a central location where she can decide her next move.)

6. Finally, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can store her newly acquired sword and any coins she may have taken. (This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.)
