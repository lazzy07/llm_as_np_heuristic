In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to ensure he has both treasure and money, as well as maintain his happiness. 

Given the current situation, Rory already has the treasure, and Vince has the money. The simplest way for Rory to achieve his goal is to take the money from Vince, as Vince is at the village and Rory is at the cave. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - This action is necessary for Rory to reach Vince, who has the money.
2. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** - This action allows Rory to acquire the money he needs to be wealthy.
3. **Rory's happiness increases to 1.** - Since Rory is now wealthy (having both treasure and money), he feels happy.

Now, Rory has achieved his goal of being happy and wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the village**: Rory needs to be at the same location as Vince to take the money.
- **Taking the money**: This is the crucial action that allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling his goal.
