To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake wants item I1 (which is not currently in the room), while Alex and Casey want item I3. 

Hereâ€™s a concise story that leads to Blake's happiness:

1. **Blake tells Alex that Casey wants I1 (the item Blake wants).** This is a strategic lie to manipulate the situation, as Blake knows that Casey actually wants I3.
2. **Alex, believing Blake, picks up I3 (which is in R21).** Alex does this because they want to make Casey happy, thinking that giving I1 to Casey will help.
3. **Blake moves to the dining room (R22) to get I1.** This is necessary for Blake to obtain the item they want.
4. **Blake picks up I1 from the dining room.** This action allows Blake to finally have the item they desire.
5. **Blake moves back to the living room (R21).** This is to be in the same room as Alex and Casey.
6. **Blake gives I1 to Casey.** This action makes Casey happy, which in turn makes Blake happy because they want Alex to be happy as well.
7. **Blake is now happy because they have I1.**

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **tell(Blake, Alex, I1, R21)** - Blake lies to influence Alex's actions.
2. **pick_up(Alex, I3, R21)** - Alex picks up I3, thinking it will make Casey happy.
3. **move(Blake, R21, R22)** - Blake moves to the dining room to get I1.
4. **pick_up(Blake, I1, R22)** - Blake picks up I1, which is the item they want.
5. **move(Blake, R22, R21)** - Blake returns to the living room.
6. **give(Blake, I1, Casey, R21)** - Blake gives I1 to Casey, making both Casey and Blake happy.
