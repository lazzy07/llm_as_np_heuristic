**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A. Young is currently in Patient Room A, but Dr. Hathaway is unaware of Young's symptoms. To ensure Young's health, the following actions will take place:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess Young to proceed with treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (due to the high workload), this treatment will be administered. If Young actually has Flaze, this will lead to Young becoming healthy.

3. **Young walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - After treatment, Young will walk to Admissions to check on Jones and Ross, ensuring they are also healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway will admit Jones to another exam room to assess and treat him.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's symptoms as Jarkis, this treatment will ensure Jones becomes healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway will admit Ross to another exam room to assess and treat him.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as Jarkis, this treatment will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Young, Jones, and Ross achieve their goal of being alive and healthy. The assessment and treatment actions are crucial for diagnosing and treating the patients correctly. The movement of Young to Admissions allows for interaction with the other patients, ensuring a cohesive narrative.
