To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action will initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to be on the surface when the volcano erupts, which will lead to her death.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action will cause the volcano to erupt. Since Zoe is now on the surface, she will die as a result of the eruption.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: This action will allow the Lizard to make peace with Zoe before the eruption occurs. However, since Zoe is already dead, this action will not be executed in the traditional sense but will signify that the Lizard had a desire to befriend Zoe, which aligns with their mutual goals.

The final story sequence will result in the volcano erupting, leading to Zoe's death, while the Lizard's intention to befriend Zoe is acknowledged, fulfilling the requirement of both characters wanting to make friends.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process, creating a dangerous situation.
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Moves Zoe to the surface where she will face the consequences of the eruption.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Executes the eruption, resulting in Zoe's death.
- **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Although Zoe is dead, this action reflects the Lizard's desire for friendship, emphasizing the theme of connection even in dire circumstances.
