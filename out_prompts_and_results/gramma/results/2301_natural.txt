To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to confront the merchant and retrieve his coin, which he needs to buy a sword for protection.

2. **Tom buys a sword from the merchant by giving her the medicine.**  
   - Tom needs a sword to defend himself against the bandit. He trades the medicine for the sword, which is a strategic move since he can always find more medicine later.

3. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After acquiring the sword, Tom returns to the crossroads to prepare for his next move.

4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there while carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom is armed and can safely reach the cottage with the medicine.
