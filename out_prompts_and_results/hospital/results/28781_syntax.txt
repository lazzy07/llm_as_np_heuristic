To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomA with Ross, and Ross has been assigned to this room, Hathaway will assess Ross to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Ross.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms observed. Since Ross has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for that symptom. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Young**: Hathaway will admit Young to an exam room (let's say PatientRoomC) to ensure he is seen by the doctor. This is necessary to address Young's health needs.

4. **Walk Young to PatientRoomC**: Young will walk from the admissions room to PatientRoomC, where he will be assessed and treated.

5. **Assess Young**: Once in PatientRoomC, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

7. **Admit Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Jones to an exam room (let's say PatientRoomB) to ensure he is also seen by the doctor.

8. **Walk Jones to PatientRoomB**: Jones will walk from the admissions room to PatientRoomB.

9. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

10. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
