In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are in the same room (R22) as Casey (C2) and Blake (C3). However, Casey wants the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R21), and Blake wants the jewelry (I3), which is with Casey. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to give the flowers to Casey, as they are both in the same room. This action will not only make Alex happy but also help Casey, who is currently unhappy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action makes Alex happy because they have the item they want (flowers), and it also helps Casey, who is now in possession of the flowers.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Casey is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Blake remains unhappy as well.

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to be happy by giving them the flowers they want. It is the only action needed to achieve Alex's goal in this scenario.
