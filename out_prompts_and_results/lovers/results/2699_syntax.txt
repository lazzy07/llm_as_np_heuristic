To ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R12) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the bathroom. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) where Blake and Alex are. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

5. **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex puts down the flowers (I3) in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to clear the space and avoid confusion about items.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
