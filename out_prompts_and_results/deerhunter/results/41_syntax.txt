To achieve Bubba's goal of eating, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Forest)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to find food.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot Bambi. This action is essential for Bubba to obtain food, as Bambi is a deer and can be eaten.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action fulfills Bubba's goal of satisfying his hunger.

The actions are chosen to ensure that Bubba can successfully transition from being hungry to being fed by utilizing the resources available to him (the rifle and Bambi).
