To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to interact with Blake to achieve their goal.

2. **tell(C3, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the jewelry (I3). This is a strategic move to inform Blake of their desire, which may prompt Blake to take action to help Casey.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room (R12) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Blake to access the jewelry and potentially give it to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I3, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they want, achieving their goal of happiness.
