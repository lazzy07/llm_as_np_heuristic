In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is also present in the room. To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

**Action:**
1. give(C3, I1, C1, R22)

**Explanation:**
- This action allows Casey to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the room (R22). By receiving the jewelry, Alex will achieve their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = C1; at(I2) = R21; at(I3) = C1; happy(C1) = True; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = False; wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3.

Alex is now happy because they have the item they wanted.
