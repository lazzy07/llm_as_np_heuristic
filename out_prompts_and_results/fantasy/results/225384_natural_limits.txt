In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to ensure he has both treasure and money, as well as maintain his happiness.

Since Rory already has the treasure and is at the village, he can take the following action:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** This action is necessary because Rory needs to confront Gargax, who is at the cave with Vince, to retrieve the money that Vince has. 

2. **Gargax eats Vince.** This action is necessary because it allows Rory to take the money from Vince's dead body, ensuring that he can become wealthy.

3. **Rory takes the money from Vince's body.** This action allows Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

4. **Rory returns to the village.** This action is necessary for Rory to be in a safe location where he can enjoy his wealth and happiness.

After these actions, Rory will have both the treasure and the money, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy. Since he is married to Talia, who is also at the village, he will be happy as well.
