After completing their daily chores, Roy, who is in the laundry room, decides to take a risk. He knows the bully is in the gym and is a constant threat to both him and Ernest. Roy stealthily moves to the hallway, where he can hear the bully's laughter echoing from the gym. He quickly locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. 

Meanwhile, Ernest, who is in the kitchen, realizes that the bully is a danger to both him and Roy. He decides to take action. He moves to the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he confronts the bully with the knife he stole earlier. In a tense struggle, Ernest manages to kill the bully, finally overcoming the threat that loomed over them.
