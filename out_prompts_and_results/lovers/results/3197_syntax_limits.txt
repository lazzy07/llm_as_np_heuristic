In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R12) and has not yet achieved happiness. 

To achieve their goal, Alex can take the following action:

1. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the bedroom, where the flowers are located. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

After this action, Alex will be in the bedroom, where the flowers are located, and can then pick them up in the next step (if needed). However, since the goal is to achieve happiness, and the only action required to reach that goal is to move to the room where the desired item is located, this single action is sufficient for the story.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **move(C1, R12, R11)**: This action allows Alex to access the bedroom, where the flowers are located. By moving to the bedroom, Alex is one step closer to obtaining the flowers, which is essential for achieving happiness.
