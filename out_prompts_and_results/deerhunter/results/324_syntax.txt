To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just eaten Bambi, and is feeling greedy. The bank clerk is at the bank with some money, and Bubba believes the clerk is alive. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Go from Forest to Bank**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money.
2. **Steal from Clerk**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle, which gives him the power to do so.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **Go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located. Without this action, he cannot confront the bank clerk or obtain the money.
   
2. **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving up the money, fulfilling his goal of becoming greedy and obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have successfully achieved his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
