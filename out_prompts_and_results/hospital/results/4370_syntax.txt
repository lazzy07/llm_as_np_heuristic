To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and Jones is assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway can walk to Exam Room B to assess Young. This is important to check Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway needs to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment after assessing him.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
