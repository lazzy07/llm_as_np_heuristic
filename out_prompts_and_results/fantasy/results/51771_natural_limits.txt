In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, and Gargax is hungry. To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the following actions take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. By eating Rory, Gargax will also take Rory's wealth, which is the money he has. This action will lead to a shift in the wealth distribution, allowing Talia to potentially become wealthy.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can now pick up the treasure that is located in the cave. This action is crucial because it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.

With these two actions, Talia becomes wealthy, as she now possesses the treasure, and her happiness can be inferred from her newfound wealth.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory:** This action is essential for Gargax to satisfy his hunger and also results in Rory's death, which allows Talia to access the treasure.
- **Talia picks up the treasure:** This action directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, as she now has the treasure.
