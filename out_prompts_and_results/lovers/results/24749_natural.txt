To complete the story and ensure that Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - Blake wants the chocolates, so this action allows Blake to obtain the item they desire.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to return to the living room to interact with Casey and Alex.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.**  
   - Since Casey wants the jewelry, this action helps to create a situation where Casey can be happy, which is important for Blake.

5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the jewelry, which is what Casey wants, thus making Casey happy.

6. **Alex gives the jewelry back to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Alex to obtain the flowers from Blake, as Alex needs to ensure Casey is happy.

7. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - Finally, this action allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry.
