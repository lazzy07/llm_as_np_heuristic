To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room to the living room. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the living room. This action is important because it allows Alex to receive an item, which may help in the next steps.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room to the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to be in a position to interact with Blake and Alex.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to finally receive the item they want, making them happy.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room to the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Blake to be present with both Alex and Casey.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
