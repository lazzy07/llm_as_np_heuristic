In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they received from Alex (C1) with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is crucial because it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they want the flowers (I1) but do not have them.
- Blake (C2) is now happy because they have the flowers (I1) they wanted.
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have the jewelry (I3) they wanted.

This single action effectively resolves the situation, allowing Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
