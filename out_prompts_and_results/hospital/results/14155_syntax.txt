To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, ensuring that all patients are taken care of, but this action is not necessary for Ross's immediate goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is essential for diagnosing Ross correctly.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment. This is the critical action that will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to check on other patients. While this does not directly affect Ross's health, it shows Hathaway's commitment to ensuring all patients are healthy.

After these actions, Ross will be healthy, achieving his goal.
