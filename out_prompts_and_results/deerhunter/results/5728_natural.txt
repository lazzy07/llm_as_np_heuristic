To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi is a potential target.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to obtain food, which will satisfy his hunger, and potentially provide him with a way to get money if he decides to sell or trade the meat.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a prerequisite for him to focus on his goal of obtaining money.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba needs to return to the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly achieves Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger first, which is essential for him to be able to think clearly and execute his plan to steal the money from the clerk.
