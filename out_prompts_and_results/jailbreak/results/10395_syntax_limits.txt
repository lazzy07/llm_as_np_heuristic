**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest realizes he needs to escape the prison to ensure his safety and to enjoy a pack of cigarettes without the threat of the bully. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife, which gives him an advantage. 

Ernest decides to take action. He moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he can access the gym. Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten him or Roy anymore. 

With the bully locked away, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he successfully escapes, leaving the prison behind.
