To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and wants to get the money from the Bank. He needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use his loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action will ensure that Bubba can take the money without any resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the Bank, achieving his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and it also results in the Clerk being dead, which satisfies the condition of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is stored.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the Clerk, who is the only obstacle preventing him from taking the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to collect the money after successfully shooting the Clerk.
