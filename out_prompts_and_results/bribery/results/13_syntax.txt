To achieve the goal of the Hero, who needs to regain control over the President, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Threaten(Villain, President)**: The Hero, now controlling the Villain, can threaten the President to instill fear. This action is necessary to shift the balance of power and make the President more susceptible to influence.

2. **Coerce(Villain, President, Money)**: After threatening the President, the Hero can coerce the Villain into wanting the President to have the Money. This action is crucial because it aligns the Villain's intentions with the Hero's goal, making the Villain act in a way that benefits the Hero.

3. **Give(Villain, President, Money)**: Finally, the Villain, now coerced, gives the Money to the President. This action is the culmination of the previous steps, as it allows the Hero to regain control over the President through the influence of the Money.

By executing these actions, the Hero successfully manipulates the situation to regain control over the President, achieving their goal.
