The bandit, having successfully robbed the medicine from the merchant, is now at the bandit camp with the medicine in her possession. She wants to ensure that she has as many coins as possible in her chest at the camp. Since the merchant is at the camp with the hero's coin, the bandit decides to take action.

The bandit walks from the camp to the crossroads, where she encounters the hero. The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to rob the hero, who is carrying the merchant's sword but no coins. The bandit successfully robs the hero of the sword, but since the hero has no coins, the bandit does not gain any coins from this action. 

However, the bandit then walks back to the camp, where she can safely store the medicine and the coins she already has in the chest. 

In this scenario, the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she already had coins there before the events unfolded.
