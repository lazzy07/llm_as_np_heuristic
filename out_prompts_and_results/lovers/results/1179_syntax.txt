To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **move(C3, R11, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R11) to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Alex, who is in the living room and has the item Casey wants.

2. **tell(C2, C3, I1, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers (I1). This is a lie, as Alex actually wants the chocolates (I2). However, this misinformation can lead to a trade or a different action that helps Casey.

3. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R11) to be with Alex, leaving Casey in the dining room.

4. **move(C3, R12, R11)**: Casey moves to the living room (R11) to be with Blake and Alex.

5. **give(C2, I3, C3, R11)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have received the jewelry, which is the item they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Blake needs to return to Alex to facilitate the next action.
- **move(C3, R12, R11)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I3, C3, R11)**: This is the crucial action that makes Casey happy by giving them the item they want.
