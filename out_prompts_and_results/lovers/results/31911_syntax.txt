To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they believe that the jewelry is with Casey (C3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what they want, but they are not the focus of Alex's goal.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of the actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
