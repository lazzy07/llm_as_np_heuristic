To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where she can confront Tom and the Merchant. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to interact with Tom to achieve her goal.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of his coin. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is part of her goal.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads after robbing Tom. This is necessary for her to move back to a location where she can access her camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that she has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit walks to the Market to confront Tom and rob him.
- The Bandit robs Tom to gain coins, which is essential for her goal.
- The Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to return to her camp.
- The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at her camp to ensure she has coins.
