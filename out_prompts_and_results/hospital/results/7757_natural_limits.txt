Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, realizes that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms and provide the correct treatment. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young, who is assigned to Exam Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young**: By assessing Young, Hathaway can identify the symptoms and determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B**: Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is assigned to Exam Room B. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones**: This assessment will help Hathaway understand Jones's condition and provide the appropriate treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze**: Assuming Young has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which will make Young healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients be healthy.
