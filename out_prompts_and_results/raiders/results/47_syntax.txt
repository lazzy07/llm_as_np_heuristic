To achieve Indiana Jones's goal of ensuring the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, the following actions will take place:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army, already armed and in possession of the Ark, takes the Ark from Indiana Jones. This action is necessary because the US Army is the only group left that can safely handle the Ark, given that it is dangerous.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army opens the Ark. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, this action is crucial because it ensures that the Ark is no longer in the hands of the Nazis, who are already dead, and it prevents the Ark from being used for nefarious purposes.

At this point, Indiana Jones has achieved his goal of ensuring that the Ark is not in the hands of the Nazis and is effectively out of play, as the US Army is no longer alive to misuse it.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: This action is necessary for the US Army to gain control of the Ark, which is essential for Indiana's goal of ensuring it is in the right hands.
- **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: This action, while fatal for the US Army, ensures that the Ark cannot be used by anyone else, including the Nazis, thus fulfilling Indiana's goal of keeping it out of the wrong hands.
