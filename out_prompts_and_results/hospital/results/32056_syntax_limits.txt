To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they will mistakenly believe Ross has the disease that matches Young's symptoms (SymptomB). This is a necessary action to determine Ross's condition and is crucial for the next step.

2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze due to the mistaken assessment. Since Ross does not actually have Flaze, he will die from this incorrect treatment. However, this action is necessary to reduce Hathaway's workload and allow for the next patient to be treated correctly.

After these actions, Hathaway will have reduced their workload, and the story can conclude with the understanding that Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy is not fully achieved due to the mistake made during the assessment.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, even though it leads to a mistake due to Hathaway's high workload.
- **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: This action is taken to attempt to treat Ross based on the mistaken belief about his condition. Although it results in Ross's death, it is necessary to reduce Hathaway's workload.
