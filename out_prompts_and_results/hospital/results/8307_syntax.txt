To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomA to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Admissions**: After treatment, Young will walk to the Admissions room to check on Jones, who is still there. This action is not strictly necessary for Young's health but aligns with the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is important to ensure that Jones also receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, and Jones will also be treated.
