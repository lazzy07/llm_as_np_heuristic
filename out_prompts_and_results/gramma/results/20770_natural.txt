To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit loots the hero's corpse to take the medicine. (This action is necessary because the bandit wants to ensure that they have valuable items, and the medicine can be used for trade or leverage.)
2. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. (This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling the bandit's goal of having coins in a safe location.)

The story unfolds as follows:

- After the bandit attacks the hero and the guard, the hero is dead, and the bandit is alive. The bandit then loots the hero's corpse to take the medicine, which adds to their inventory.
- With the hero's coin already taken by the bandit, the bandit now has the medicine and the hero's coin. The bandit then decides to return to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest, ensuring that they have a safe stash of wealth.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve their goal effectively.
