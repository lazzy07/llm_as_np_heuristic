To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene and avoid any potential consequences.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, which indicates he is still hungry after the events. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking care of his needs after achieving his goal.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank. This action is necessary for him to potentially confront the clerk again or to check if there are any remaining opportunities.

6. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba goes back to the forest again, indicating he is still trying to find a safe place after the robbery.

7. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank once more, showing his indecisiveness or perhaps a desire to ensure he has taken everything he can.

8. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba goes back to the forest, solidifying his escape after the robbery.

The actions taken ensure that Bubba successfully steals the money from the bank clerk while also addressing his hunger. The repeated movements between the bank and the forest illustrate Bubba's attempts to navigate the situation after achieving his goal.
