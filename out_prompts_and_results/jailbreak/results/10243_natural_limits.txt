Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows he has the knife and the cigarettes, but he needs to ensure his safety first. Since the gym is not locked, he can confront the bully directly. 

**Action:** Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully in the gym.

This action is necessary because it eliminates the immediate threat to both himself and Roy. By killing the bully, Ernest secures his safety and can later share the cigarettes with Roy without fear of retaliation.

After killing the bully, Ernest can then escape with Roy, but for the purpose of this story, the focus is on Ernest achieving his goal of being alive and not threatened.
