To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to secure her coins in the chest there. This is necessary because her goal is to have coins in the chest, and the Bandit Camp is the only location where she can store them.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action directly fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by moving to the Bandit Camp and taking the coins. 

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- The first action is essential for the Bandit to reach her preferred location where she can manage her coins.
- The second action is crucial as it allows her to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.
