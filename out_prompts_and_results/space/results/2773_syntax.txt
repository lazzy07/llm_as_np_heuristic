To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will initiate a peace-making action with the Lizard while they are both in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that Zoe can explore the planet further while remaining safe, as the cave is a secure location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will also walk from the cave to the surface. This action is important because it shows that the Lizard is willing to accompany Zoe, reinforcing their newfound friendship.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe will again make peace with the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship in a new location, ensuring that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
