To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is not armed. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin that Tom has, which is the only coin in the current situation.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to acquire a coin without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed and is an easy target.
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: This action is required for the Bandit to move to a safe location (the Bandit Camp) where she can store her newly acquired coin.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to ensure she has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.
