To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is also present and has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk because he is greedy and wants the money. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk and take the money.
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk and take the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money without any opposition. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

With these two actions, we achieve the goal of having Bubba with the money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
