In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. Both characters are currently safe but aware of the danger surrounding them. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and one character die, while also ensuring that they become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better, which is essential for their safety and well-being.

2. **The volcano erupts.** This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and causing a character to die. Since both characters are on the surface, the eruption will lead to the demise of one of them.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, approaches the Lizard and suggests they work together to find safety. They both agree to make peace, understanding that cooperation is essential for their survival.
- However, despite their newfound friendship, the volcano erupts violently, and both characters are caught in the eruption. Unfortunately, Zoe is unable to escape in time and perishes in the eruption.

This sequence of actions achieves the desired outcome of the volcano erupting, one character dying, and the two characters making friends before the tragic event.
