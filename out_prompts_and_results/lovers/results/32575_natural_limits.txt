In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy because they do not have the items they want. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Blake decides to take action. Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom, which is a lie, but it leads Casey to believe that they should check there. 

Casey, believing Blake, moves to the bathroom to look for the chocolates. This leaves Blake alone in the living room with Alex. 

Blake then picks up the chocolates, which were previously in the bathroom, and now Blake is happy because they have the item they wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom**: This action is necessary because it misleads Casey into leaving the living room, allowing Blake to take the chocolates without interference.

3. **Blake picks up the chocolates**: This action is the final step that allows Blake to achieve happiness by obtaining the item they wanted.
