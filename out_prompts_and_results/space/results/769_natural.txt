Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. The Lizard, also present, senses the threat and understands that they need to work together to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows both characters to stop being enemies and opens the door for friendship, which is essential for both of them to achieve their goals of safety and health.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the erupting surface. The cave provides shelter from the volcanic activity.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** This action solidifies their new relationship, ensuring that they can work together in the future and support each other.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave until the eruption is over.** This action ensures that both characters remain safe from the dangers of the surface until it is safe to return.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship, allowing them to thrive together.
