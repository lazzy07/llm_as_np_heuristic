Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially make peace with the Lizard. She walks towards the cave where the Lizard is located, hoping to communicate and establish a friendship.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave.** This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, as she believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface and wants to change that perception.

Once Zoe arrives at the cave, she finds the Lizard and attempts to communicate.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is one of her goals. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends.

After making peace, the Lizard realizes that Zoe is not a threat and that they can work together to ensure their mutual safety.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure both characters' safety from the eruption. Since they are friends, they can cooperate to escape the danger.

However, in this scenario, the volcano erupts before they can escape, leading to a tragic ending.

5. **The volcano finishes erupting.** This action results in Zoe dying, as she is unable to escape in time.

In summary, the story unfolds as follows:
- Zoe walks to the cave to meet the Lizard.
- They make peace and become friends.
- The volcano erupts, and despite their friendship, Zoe is unable to escape in time and dies.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired ending of the story, where the volcano erupts, resulting in a character's death, while also establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
