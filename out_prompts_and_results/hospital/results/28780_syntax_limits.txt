In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Ross, who is in Exam Room A with a symptom (SymptomA) that Hathaway has assessed. Jones and Young are still in the admissions room, and their symptoms are unknown.

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Young's symptoms. This is necessary to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment needed.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C. This action is essential to ensure Young is in a designated area for treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross in Exam Room A with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will treat him correctly, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young receive the necessary care, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
