To achieve the Nazis' goal of immortality, the following actions will be taken:

1. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: The Nazis will open the Ark of the Covenant, which they believe is safe. Since the Ark is not dangerous, this action will grant them immortality.

This is the only necessary action to ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of becoming immortal. The other characters (Indiana and the US Army) are present but do not take any actions that would interfere with the Nazis' goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: This action is crucial because it directly leads to the Nazis achieving their goal of immortality. They have the Ark, and since it is not dangerous, opening it will result in them becoming immortal.
