In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. The current situation shows that Rory has accepted Talia's marriage proposal, but he is still not wealthy since he has no money. To achieve his goal, Rory needs to acquire money.

Here's the shortest story where Rory achieves his goal:

1. **Action: travel(Rory, Cave, Village)** - Rory travels to the Village where Vince is located. This is necessary because Vince has money, and Rory needs to acquire it to become wealthy.

2. **Action: take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)** - Rory takes the money from Vince. This action is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

Now, Rory has money, is married to Talia (which makes him happy), and is not hungry, thus achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the Village**: Rory needs to go to the Village to access Vince, who has the money.
- **Taking the Money**: This action directly fulfills Rory's need to become wealthy, which is one of his primary goals.
