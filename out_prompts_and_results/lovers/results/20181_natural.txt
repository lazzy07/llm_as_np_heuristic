To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness.

2. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps to clear the space and allows Casey to potentially pursue their own happiness later.

3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - Similar to Casey's action, this helps to clear the space and allows Blake to potentially pursue their own happiness later.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers and will be happy, achieving their goal.
