To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with a loaded rifle, and the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal of having the money is to steal it from the clerk using the loaded rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (This action allows Bubba to escape with the stolen money.)

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will still be alive, but the story's requirement is satisfied as Bubba has achieved his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal:** This is a necessary mental action that leads Bubba to take the next step.
- **Steal the money:** This is the action that directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Go to the forest:** This action signifies Bubba's escape after successfully stealing the money.
