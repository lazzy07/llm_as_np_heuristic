Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to find a way to be safe and healthy, and perhaps make a friend in the process. Meanwhile, the Lizard is in the cave, safe from the eruption but aware of Zoe's presence on the surface.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the cave.** This action is taken because Zoe needs to escape the dangerous surface and find safety in the cave where the Lizard is. By teleporting, she avoids the risk of being harmed by the volcano.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard begin to talk.** This action is necessary for them to establish a relationship. Since they are not fighting, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions.

3. **Zoe expresses her desire to be friends and to ensure both of them are safe.** This is a crucial step in building a friendship, as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe.

4. **The Lizard agrees to be friends with Zoe.** This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that both characters achieve their goal of making friends.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to work together to monitor the volcano.** This collaborative action helps both characters stay safe and healthy, as they can alert each other to any dangers.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
