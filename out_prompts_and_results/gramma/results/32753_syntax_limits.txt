In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has just attacked both the Guard and the Merchant, leaving them dead. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Merchant had some coins, the Bandit can loot the Merchant's corpse to achieve her goal.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)** - The Bandit loots the coins from the Merchant's corpse at the Crossroads.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to go to the bandit camp, thus achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
