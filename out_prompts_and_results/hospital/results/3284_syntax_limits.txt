In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in the admissions room with Jones, who has been assigned to exam room A. Young is also in exam room A, and Ross is still in the admissions room. Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy.

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room A to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action ensures that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Ross. This is important because Ross is still unassessed, and Hathaway needs to ensure all patients are treated.
