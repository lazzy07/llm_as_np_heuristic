In this story, we will ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy by having Hathaway assess and treat them correctly. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomB to confirm the symptoms. Since Jones has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that Jones has Flaze, which requires antibiotics for treatment. This action is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Jones.

2. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics in PatientRoomB. Since Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make Jones healthy. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Jones achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.
