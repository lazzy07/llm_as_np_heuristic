Ernest, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to ensure his survival. He has the knife, and he understands that this is his only chance to eliminate the threat. 

**Action:** Ernest kills the bully with the knife.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses the threat posed by the bully. By eliminating the bully, Ernest secures his own safety and that of his friend Roy. With the bully gone, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison without fear of being threatened.

After killing the bully, Ernest can then use the civilian clothes he stole earlier to disguise himself. He can then escape through the hallway to the highway, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
