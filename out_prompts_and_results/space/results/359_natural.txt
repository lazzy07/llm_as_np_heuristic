To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the dangerous surface where the volcano is located, setting the stage for the eruption.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** - This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action results in Zoe's death, which is a direct consequence of the volcano erupting.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action allows the Lizard to witness the aftermath of the eruption and Zoe's fate, which can lead to a moment of reflection.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe (in spirit).** - Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard can still honor their friendship and make peace with her memory, solidifying their bond even in her absence.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying (Zoe), and the Lizard making peace with Zoe, thus maintaining the theme of friendship.
