To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Admissions and assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important because Young is also a patient who needs to be treated.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the disease affecting Ross.
   
2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway walks to Admissions and assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure Young receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures Young's recovery as well.
