In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (the jewelry), which is currently with Blake. To achieve their goal, Blake can simply give the jewelry to Alex.

Hereâ€™s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R12).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the item they want (I1).
- Blake will also be happy because they have made Alex happy.

This single action is sufficient for Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by ensuring Alex is happy.

### Explanation of the action:
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This action is necessary because it directly fulfills both Blake's desire to make Alex happy and Blake's own happiness by giving away the item that Alex wants.
