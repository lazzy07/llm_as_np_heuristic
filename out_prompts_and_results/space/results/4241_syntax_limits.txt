Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they share a mutual desire to be healthy and safe while also wanting to make friends. 

To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, which is a safe location. However, this action makes the Lizard angry, as it feels abandoned on the dangerous surface.
