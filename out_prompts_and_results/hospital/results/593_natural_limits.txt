**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Ross, who is experiencing a fever. Recognizing the symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. 

Next, Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. However, Hathaway cannot determine Jones's condition without further information. Therefore, Hathaway decides to admit Young to Patient Room B, where Young is experiencing a rash. 

Hathaway then assesses Young and correctly identifies the symptoms of Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully making him healthy as well.
