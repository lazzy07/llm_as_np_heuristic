To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can safely leave the market and reach the cottage without being attacked or hindered by the other characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to get closer to the cottage. This action is necessary for him to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom continues on to the cottage. This is the final step to reach his destination.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is essential because Tom must leave the market where he is currently located. The market is a dangerous place for him since he has just attacked the merchant and is now a criminal. He needs to get away from the guard and the bandit.

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary for Tom to reach his ultimate goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. The cottage is his desired location, and this action completes his journey.

Since there are no other characters taking actions that would interfere with Tom's journey after he leaves the market, he can safely reach the cottage.
