To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to proceed.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Ross to identify his symptoms as well. This is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Jones to find out his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.
