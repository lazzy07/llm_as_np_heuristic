To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom drops the medicine at the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to fulfill his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

The story is very short because Tom's goal is straightforward, and he only needs to walk to the cottage to achieve it. The other characters' actions are irrelevant to Tom's goal, so they are not included in the story.
