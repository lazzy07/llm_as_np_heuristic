**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, walks into Exam Room A to assess Jones. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Jones is alive and healthy.
