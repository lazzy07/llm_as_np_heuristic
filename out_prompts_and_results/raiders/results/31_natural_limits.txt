After the Nazis take the Ark from Indiana Jones, they believe they can harness its power for immortality. However, unbeknownst to them, the Ark is dangerous. The U.S. Army, aware of the Nazis' intentions, quickly devises a plan to retrieve the Ark.

1. The U.S. Army, armed and ready, confronts the Nazis in the USA. They take the Ark from the Nazis by force, as the Nazis are not prepared for a direct assault.
2. With the Ark now in their possession, the U.S. Army decides to open it, believing it to be safe. However, they are unaware of its true nature. As they open the Ark, it unleashes its dangerous power, killing the Nazis instantly.
3. The U.S. Army, having survived the encounter, now possesses the Ark of the Covenant.

1. **Take the Ark from the Nazis by force:** This action is necessary for the U.S. Army to achieve their goal of obtaining the Ark. Since the Nazis are armed, the U.S. Army must act decisively to ensure they can retrieve the Ark before the Nazis can use it.
   
2. **Open the Ark:** The U.S. Army believes the Ark is safe, and this action is crucial for them to gain the immortality they seek. However, it also serves the purpose of eliminating the Nazis, as the Ark is dangerous.

3. **The outcome of the Ark being opened:** This action leads to the Nazis' demise, ensuring that they can no longer pursue their goal of immortality, while the U.S. Army retains possession of the Ark.
