In the living room, Alex is happily holding the flowers, and Casey is content with the jewelry. Blake, however, is still unhappy because they want the chocolates that are in the dining room. 

To achieve their goal, Blake decides to take action. Blake moves from the dining room to the living room to talk to Alex and Casey. 

Blake says to Alex, "I think you should give me the flowers, and I can give you the chocolates." This is a lie, as Blake actually wants the chocolates for themselves. 

Alex, believing Blake, agrees to trade the flowers for the chocolates. 

Blake then picks up the chocolates from the dining room and gives them to Alex in exchange for the flowers. 

Now, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex is still happy with the flowers. Casey remains happy with the jewelry.
