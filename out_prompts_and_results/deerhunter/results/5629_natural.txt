To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba's goal being met without any unnecessary actions.

Here’s the completed story:

1. Bubba is at the forest and has already shot Bambi, which means he has food available to eat. He is hungry, so he decides to eat Bambi.
2. After eating, Bubba feels satisfied and no longer has the desire to take any further actions.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating will satisfy his hunger. It also aligns with the fact that he has already shot Bambi, which provides him with food.
- No further actions are needed because Bubba already has 1 money, which is his goal.

The story concludes with Bubba having achieved his goal of having 1 money and being satisfied after eating.
