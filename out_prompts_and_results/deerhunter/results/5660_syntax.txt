To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and steal money. This action is necessary to move to the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba is back at the bank, he can steal from the clerk using the rifle he has. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest to ensure he is away from the bank and the clerk, minimizing the risk of being caught.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Since Bubba is hungry, he will decide to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba's survival and well-being.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and allows him to sustain himself.

The actions are structured to ensure that Bubba first retrieves the money and then addresses his hunger, achieving his goals efficiently.
