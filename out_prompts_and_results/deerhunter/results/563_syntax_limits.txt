Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, is in the forest with a loaded rifle. He spots Bambi, the deer, and decides to shoot her to satisfy his hunger. After shooting Bambi, he eats her, fulfilling his need for food. With his hunger satisfied, he then decides to go to the bank to steal the money from the bank clerk, who is unaware of Bubba's intentions. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats her. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger.
3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba then travels to the bank to pursue his goal of getting money.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, while Bambi is dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.
