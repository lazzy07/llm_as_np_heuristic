To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary for Alex to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R21). This is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake after picking up the jewelry. This keeps the characters together, which is important for their interactions.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to themselves (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is a bit unconventional, but it signifies that Alex has successfully obtained the item they wanted.
