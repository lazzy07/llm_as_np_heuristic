In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room B with Jones, who has been admitted to that room. Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosing Jones. To ensure that Hathaway can treat Jones correctly and achieve their goal of making all patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Hathaway's workload is high, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but assessing is necessary to proceed with treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, or if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By taking these two actions, Hathaway can effectively diagnose and treat Jones, thereby achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
