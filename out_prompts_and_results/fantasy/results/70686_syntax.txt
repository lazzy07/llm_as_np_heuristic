To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow Rory to gain wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village. This is necessary for Rory to be in a location where he can interact with Talia and potentially secure his happiness.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has already proposed and Rory accepted, this action will make both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

At this point, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is wealthy (due to the treasure), happy (because he is married to Talia), and not hungry (as there is no indication of hunger in the actions taken).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is crucial for Rory to gain wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to return to the village to interact with Talia and solidify his happiness through marriage.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness, as marrying Talia makes both of them happy.
