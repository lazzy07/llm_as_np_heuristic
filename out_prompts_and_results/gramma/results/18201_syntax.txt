To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: Tom will walk to the bandit camp to confront the bandit and take the coins from the chest, which will help him become less of a criminal and more capable of achieving his goal.

2. **rob(Tom, BanditCoin, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: Tom will rob the bandit to take the coins from her. This action is necessary for Tom to gather resources that will help him in his journey.

3. **walk(Tom, Bandit Camp, Crossroads)**: After robbing the bandit, Tom will walk back to the crossroads to change his location and prepare to head to the cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the crossroads to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to gather the necessary coins while also ensuring he is armed and capable of defending himself against the bandit. The actions are efficient and directly lead to Tom's goal.
