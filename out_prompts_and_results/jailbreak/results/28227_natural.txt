**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest and Roy are in the kitchen, feeling the tension from the bully's threats. They know they need to act quickly to ensure their survival and to get the pack of cigarettes.

1. **Ernest gives the knife to Roy.** (This action is necessary because it allows Roy to have a weapon for self-defense against the bully if needed.)
2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action is crucial as it disguises Roy, allowing him to escape later if the situation escalates.)
3. **Ernest and Roy move to the hallway.** (They need to get closer to the gym to lock the bully in and ensure their safety.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This action secures the bully inside, preventing him from threatening them further.)
5. **Roy sneaks through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to confront the bully without being seen by the guards.)
6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, ensuring their safety.)
7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (Now that the bully is dead, Roy can escape without fear of being caught.)
8. **Roy escapes to the highway.** (This final action allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to either eliminate the threat posed by the bully or to facilitate the escape of Roy and Ernest. The knife is used to kill the bully, ensuring they are no longer threatened. The civilian clothes are essential for disguise, allowing for a successful escape. Locking the gym door is a strategic move to prevent the bully from retaliating.
