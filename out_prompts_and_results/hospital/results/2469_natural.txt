**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that all patients are still in the admissions room and needing to assess their conditions, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room C to assess Young. Since Young is now in Patient Room C, Hathaway can evaluate their symptoms. However, due to the increased workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze instead of Jarkis.

Despite the mistake, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the incorrect treatment for Jarkis. Unfortunately, this results in Young's death. 

Now, with Young's condition assessed, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room A. This reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway again mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross survives this treatment, as he does not have Flaze.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones. Again, due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Jones also survives this treatment.

In the end, all patients are alive, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated them, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
