In the current situation, Blake (C3) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Blake needs to acquire the item I2. 

Since Casey (C2) wants I2 and is currently unhappy, Blake can help Casey by giving them the item they have, which is I1 (the flowers). This action will make Casey happy, and in turn, Blake will also be happy because they will have fulfilled their goal of making Alex (C1) happy by helping Casey.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R22). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want (I2), and it also aligns with Blake's goal of making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake (C3) will be happy because they helped Casey.
- Casey (C2) will be happy because they received the flowers.
- Alex (C1) remains happy as they have I3.

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy by helping Casey.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
