To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. Gargax eats Talia.

**Explanation of the action:**
- Gargax, the dragon, is at the cave with Talia and Rory. Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Talia, Gargax can eliminate her from the story, which allows Rory to inherit the treasure without Talia's claim to it. Since Talia is married to Rory, her death would not affect his happiness, but it would allow Rory to become wealthy by keeping the treasure. This action ultimately leads to Talia's goal of being wealthy, as she is now part of the treasure that Rory possesses.
