To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to stop any potential fighting and start building a friendship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further their relationship and to ensure they are in the same location to interact positively.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will again attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship. This action is taken to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she has successfully established a friendship with the Lizard.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
