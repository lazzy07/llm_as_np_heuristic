To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to fulfill Tom's goal of carrying the medicine, as he is now at the cottage.

The story is very short because Tom's goal is straightforward: he needs to be at the cottage with the medicine. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, and since he has already acquired the medicine, he simply needs to reach the cottage.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.",
    "Tom uses the medicine."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom achieves his goal efficiently and effectively.
