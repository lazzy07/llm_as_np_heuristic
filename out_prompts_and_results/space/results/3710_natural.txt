Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, as both characters are currently not safe. By moving to the cave, they can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship solidifies their bond and ensures they are both committed to helping each other. This action is crucial for their mutual goal of safety and friendship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave.** They decide to remain in the cave until the danger has passed. This action is implied as they are now in a safe location, away from the erupting volcano.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other. They successfully avoid the dangers of the surface and strengthen their friendship.
