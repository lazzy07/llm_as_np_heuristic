To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location where she can store her coins.

2. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the merchant's corpse.**  
   - Since the merchant is dead and the bandit has already robbed the hero, this action allows the bandit to acquire the hero's coin, increasing her total.

3. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

With these actions, the bandit successfully increases her wealth and fulfills her objective.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is crucial as it allows the bandit to return to her base of operations, the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins.
- The second action is essential for the bandit to gain additional coins, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
- The final action secures the coins in the chest, ensuring that the bandit has achieved her goal of having coins stored safely.
