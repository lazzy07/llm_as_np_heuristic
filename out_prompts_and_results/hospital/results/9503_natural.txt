**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Young is showing symptoms of a rash, decides to treat Young for Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the urgency of treating Young outweighs that risk.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** 
   - This action is necessary because Young is experiencing a rash, which is a symptom of Jarkis. Treating Young with steroids (the correct treatment for Jarkis) will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition. Since Jones is currently in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Dr. Hathaway needs to check for any symptoms.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**
   - Assuming that Jones is experiencing a fever (the only symptom left unaccounted for), Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition. Since Ross is also in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Dr. Hathaway needs to check for any symptoms.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**
   - Assuming that Ross is experiencing a fever (the only symptom left unaccounted for), Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to assess and treat the patients based on their symptoms. The doctor prioritizes treating Young first due to the visible symptoms, followed by assessing and treating Jones and Ross to ensure they also receive the necessary care.
