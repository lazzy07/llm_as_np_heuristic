In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (jewelry), and Blake currently has item I2 (chocolates). To achieve their goal, Blake can give the chocolates to Alex, which will make Alex happy. 

Here’s the action Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for chocolates, making Alex happy. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the item they want (I1).
- Blake will also be happy because they have made Alex happy.

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy by making Alex happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
