To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and it will lead to Rory's death. Since Rory is currently at the village, Gargax can easily eat him there. This action will also allow Gargax to fulfill his desire of not being hungry, as he will consume Rory.

2. **Vince takes the treasure from Rory's dead body**: After Rory is eaten by Gargax, he will be dead at the village. Vince can then take the treasure from Rory's body. This action is crucial because it allows Vince to gain the treasure, which contributes to his wealth.

3. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince, now with the treasure, can propose to Talia. This action is important as it allows Vince to pursue happiness through marriage.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which leads to both characters being happy. This is essential for Vince to achieve his goal of happiness.

5. **Talia and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies their relationship and ensures that both Talia and Vince are happy.

By following these actions, Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry is achieved through the indirect consequences of his death, while Vince also finds happiness and wealth.
