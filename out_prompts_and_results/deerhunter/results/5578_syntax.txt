To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a rifle and has just killed Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will need to go back to the bank to steal from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and focus on his next goal of acquiring money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is essential as it brings him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads his rifle with ammunition. This action is crucial because it prepares him to threaten the bank clerk, ensuring he has the means to intimidate or harm if necessary.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the loaded rifle. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to intimidate the clerk, ensuring he can successfully steal the money.
