To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged, and she has the treasure. The goal is to get married, which will make both Talia and Rory happy, and Talia will also be wealthy due to her possession of the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be with Talia.
   - This action is necessary for Rory to be present with Talia so they can get married.

2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to meet Rory.
   - This action is necessary for Talia to be present with Rory for the marriage.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married in the cave.
   - This action is essential as it fulfills Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy through marriage.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry.
   - This action is included to show that Rory is not focused on wealth at this moment, but it does not affect the outcome.

5. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry.
   - Similar to Rory, this shows Talia's state but does not affect her happiness or wealth.

6. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry.
   - This action is included to show that Vince is also not focused on wealth, but it does not affect the outcome.

7. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry.
   - This action is included to show that Gargax is also not focused on wealth, but it does not affect the outcome.

After these actions, Talia is married to Rory, which makes her happy, and she retains her treasure, ensuring her wealth.
