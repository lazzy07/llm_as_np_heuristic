To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain social connections.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to check on the jewelry. This action is included to show Casey's interest in the situation.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21) to see what is happening. This action is included to show Blake's involvement.

At this point, Alex has the jewelry (I1) and is happy. The other characters may still be unhappy, but the goal is to ensure Alex achieves happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This is the action that directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it shows Alex's social connection with the other characters.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)** and **move(C3, R22, R21)**: These actions illustrate the involvement of Casey and Blake, but they do not affect Alex's happiness directly.
