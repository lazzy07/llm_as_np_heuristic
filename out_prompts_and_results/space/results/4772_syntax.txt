To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the surface is dangerous, and both characters are healthy but not safe. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety, and then she can return to the surface to continue building a friendship with the Lizard.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe wants to be safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface. This action is important for Zoe to continue her efforts to make friends with the Lizard.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon returning to the surface, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it solidifies their friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Teleporting to the ship** ensures Zoe's safety from the dangerous surface.
- **Teleporting back to the surface** allows Zoe to re-engage with the Lizard and continue her mission of friendship.
- **Making peace** with the Lizard establishes a friendly relationship, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends.
