The bandit, armed with her sword, stands at the crossroads with the medicine she stole from the merchant. She sees the hero, who is also at the crossroads, and decides to take action. The bandit approaches the hero and, using her sword, she attacks and kills him. After the hero falls, the bandit loots the hero's corpse, taking the merchant's sword and any coins he might have had. With the hero out of the way, the bandit now has the medicine and can return to the bandit camp with her loot.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack and kill the hero**: The bandit uses her sword to eliminate the hero, who is not armed. This action is crucial as it removes a potential threat and allows the bandit to take the items the hero is carrying.
2. **Loot the hero's corpse**: After killing the hero, the bandit takes the items from him, which may include coins or a sword. This action helps the bandit achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of having the medicine and potentially more coins.
