**Story Completion:**

After Young walks from PatientRoomC to PatientRoomA, they find Ross and Hathaway in the room. Young, feeling a bit anxious, decides to assess Ross to see if he shows any symptoms. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross, who is showing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway notes this and prepares to treat him.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy.

3. **walk(Young, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Young walks to the admissions room to inform Jones about Ross's recovery and to check on his own health.

With Ross treated successfully, Young feels relieved and hopeful about their own health, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The assessment of Ross is crucial for Hathaway to correctly identify the disease and provide the right treatment.
- Treating Ross with steroids is necessary to ensure he recovers, which also indirectly supports Young's goal of being healthy by creating a positive environment.
- Young walking to the admissions room is a final action to check on Jones and ensure that all patients are accounted for and healthy.
