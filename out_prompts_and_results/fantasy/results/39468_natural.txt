To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave where the treasure is located. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** (This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can provide her with wealth.)
2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.** (Talia needs to return to the village to be with Rory and Vince, who are both there.)
3. **Talia proposes marriage to Rory.** (Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant but serves to reinforce her commitment to Rory.)
4. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.** (This action ensures that Talia and Rory are happy together.)
5. **Talia proposes marriage to Vince.** (Similar to the previous proposal, this reinforces her commitment to Vince.)
