To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed level of 1, indicating he wants money. The clerk is also in the bank and has no money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only character in the bank who could potentially stop Bubba from getting the money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance, which is important for his survival.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to take the money from the clerk's body. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, ensuring he remains alive and capable of continuing his actions.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's intention to acquire money after eliminating the threat.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Directly achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
