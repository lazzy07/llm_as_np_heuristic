To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions to acquire the treasure while leveraging her relationships with Rory and Vince. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, sees Vince as a means to satisfy his hunger. By eating Vince, Gargax eliminates a competitor for the treasure and gains wealth from Vince's money.
   
2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - With Vince gone, Talia can now access the treasure that was previously at the cave. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **Talia's happiness increases.** - Talia is now wealthy due to acquiring the treasure, which contributes to her happiness.

At this point, Talia has achieved her goal of being happy and wealthy, as she has the treasure and is married to both Rory and Vince (though Vince is now dead, which does not affect her happiness).
