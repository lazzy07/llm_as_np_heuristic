Given the current situation, the following action will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Alex (C1) to eventually receive the jewelry they want, as Casey will now have the jewelry and can give it to Alex.
