To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and return to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for the next steps.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe and the Lizard can make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting and a character dying.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption results in the Lizard's death. This action is implied by the eruption, as the Lizard is on the surface when the volcano erupts.

The final sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, the Lizard dies, and Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: This action is necessary to bring Zoe to the same location as the Lizard, allowing for interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which is a key event in the story.
- **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: This action represents the consequence of the eruption, resulting in the Lizard's death.
