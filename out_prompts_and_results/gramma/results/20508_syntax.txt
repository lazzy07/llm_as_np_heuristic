To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had just bought from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without needing to go to the chest at the camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coin in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling the Bandit's goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, after attacking the Merchant and realizing that Tom is dead, decides to rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had just purchased. This is a strategic move to increase her wealth without drawing the attention of the Guard.
- With the coin in hand, the Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can safely store the coin in the chest, thus achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully completes her objective with minimal actions, ensuring she has the coin secured.
