In this story, the Merchant wants to collect as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The Merchant is currently at the Bandit Camp with the Medicine, while Tom is at the Crossroads. The Bandit is also at the Crossroads, and the Guard is at the Market.

To achieve the Merchant's goal, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rob the Bandit**: The Merchant, who is armed with a sword, can rob the Bandit, who is not armed. This action allows the Merchant to take the Bandit's coins, increasing her wealth without committing a crime.

2. **Walk to the Market**: After robbing the Bandit, the Merchant can walk to the Market to safely store her coins and avoid any potential confrontation with the Bandit or the Guard.

These actions are necessary for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal. The Merchant successfully robs the Bandit and then moves to a safer location.
