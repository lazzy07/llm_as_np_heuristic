Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She sees the Lizard nearby and realizes that they both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and make peace.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is chosen because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. By making peace, Zoe can ensure that both she and the Lizard can work together to find safety from the volcano.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can leave the surface together, ensuring their safety.
