To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. Talia has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she needs to solidify her happiness through marriage. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action is crucial because it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through a committed relationship. 

2. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: After the marriage, Vince travels back to the village. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness but can be seen as a step towards a new life together.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia follows Vince to the village. This action signifies their unity as a married couple and allows them to start their new life together.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry, which is a necessary action to set up the next event.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to remove Rory from the story, as he is not aligned with Talia's goals and his presence could complicate her happiness.

At the end of these actions, Talia is married to Vince, has the treasure, and is thus wealthy and happy.
