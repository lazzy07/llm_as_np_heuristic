To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where Tom is located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to confront Tom to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of the coin he is carrying. This action is essential for the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads after robbing Tom. This is necessary to either head back to the camp or to secure her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins secured in her camp, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit walks to the Market to confront Tom and rob him.
- The Bandit robs Tom to gain a coin, which is a direct action towards her goal.
- The Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to prepare for the next action.
- Finally, the Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp to ensure she has coins secured.
