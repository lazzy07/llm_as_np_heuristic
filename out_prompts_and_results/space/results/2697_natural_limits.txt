Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to leave the cave and teleport back to the spaceship to ensure their safety. However, as they prepare to leave, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava flows toward the cave. In a desperate attempt to save Zoe, the Lizard pushes her out of the way, sacrificing itself in the process.

This action sequence is necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, a character dies, and the two characters are friends. The Lizard's sacrifice demonstrates the bond they formed, highlighting the theme of friendship and selflessness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship"]
}
``` 

(Note: The action of teleporting to the spaceship is implied to be the last action before the volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's sacrifice.)
