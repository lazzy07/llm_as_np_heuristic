To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the bathroom (R21). This action is not directly related to Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential future interactions.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22). This action is also not directly related to Alex's happiness but helps to maintain the narrative structure.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
