To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, which is essential for making peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption that will lead to a character's death.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action results in the death of Zoe, as she is still on the surface when the eruption occurs.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and she and the Lizard become friends before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: This action is taken to allow Zoe to reach the Lizard and initiate a friendly interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action is taken to establish a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with both characters' goals of making friends.
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is taken to trigger the volcanic eruption, which is a critical plot point leading to the climax of the story.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action results in the death of Zoe, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.
