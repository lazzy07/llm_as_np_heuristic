To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her goals and the available items. Since Talia is currently in the Cave, she can access the Treasure there. The plan will involve Talia picking up the Treasure, which will make her wealthy, thus fulfilling one of her goals.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the Treasure located in the Cave. This action is necessary because it directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

After this action, Talia will have the Treasure, which will increase her wealth. Since Talia's happiness is already at 1 (due to her marriage to Rory), she will achieve both her goals of being happy and wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is essential as it allows Talia to acquire the Treasure, which directly contributes to her wealth. Since Talia's happiness is already satisfied through her marriage, this action ensures she meets her wealth goal.
