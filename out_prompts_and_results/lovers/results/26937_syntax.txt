To complete the story and ensure that Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Since Casey is currently happy with the chocolates (I3), we need to facilitate a trade between Casey and Blake.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where Alex and Casey are currently located. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to facilitate the trade.

2. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I3) they have for the jewelry (I2) that Blake has. This action is crucial because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but helps to conclude the story with Blake in a different location.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they now possess the jewelry (I2), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary to bring Casey to the same room as Blake for the trade to occur.
- **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: This is the key action that allows Blake to get the jewelry they want, thus making them happy.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: This action is optional but provides a sense of closure to the story by moving Blake to a different room after achieving their goal.
