To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money rather than earning it through legitimate means.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry, so he decides to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank to find Bambi, the deer, who is in the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to find food.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses his rifle to shoot Bambi, killing her. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain food to eat, as he is hungry.

6. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and completes his goal of obtaining food.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goals of obtaining money and satisfying his hunger.
