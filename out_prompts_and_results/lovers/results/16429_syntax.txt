To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1 - flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be out of the way to allow Alex to pick up the flowers.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) as well. This action is necessary to facilitate the next steps where Blake can help Alex.

3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the living room (R22). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Blake. This action is necessary because Alex wants to ensure Blake is happy, and Blake can then help Casey.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex.

6. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action ensures that Casey is happy, as they wanted the chocolates.

After these actions, Alex has the flowers (I1) and is happy, fulfilling their goal.
