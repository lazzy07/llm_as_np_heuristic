To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I3) they want with Alex (C1) for the flowers (I1) that Alex currently has. This action is necessary because Casey needs to give Alex something they want in exchange for the item they desire.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: After the trade, Blake (C2) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to finally receive the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy because they have what they want.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy because they have what they want.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy because they have what they want.
