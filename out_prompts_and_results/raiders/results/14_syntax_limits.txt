After the Nazis opened the Ark of the Covenant, they were killed due to its dangerous nature. Indiana Jones, realizing that the Ark is now unguarded, quickly travels from Tanis back to the United States to inform the US Army about the situation. He believes that the Ark is now safe to retrieve since the Nazis are dead and no longer pose a threat.

Once in the USA, Indiana Jones gives the information about the Ark's location to the US Army, who then travel to Tanis to claim the Ark for themselves. With the Nazis out of the way and the Ark now in the hands of the US Army, Indiana's goal of ensuring the Ark is with the US Army is achieved.
