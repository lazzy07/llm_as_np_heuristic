The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, now stands at the crossroads with the hero's coin and the merchant's sword. The bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. 

To achieve this, the bandit will take the following actions:

1. **Walk from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to deposit the coins into the chest at the camp, which is part of her goal.

2. **Loot the coins from the chest.** The bandit will take the coins that were previously stored in the chest, increasing her total amount of coins.

Now, the story unfolds as follows:

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her preferred location where she can store her coins.
   
2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest. This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully increased her coin count, fulfilling her objective.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk from the crossroads to the bandit camp",
    "loot the coins from the chest"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal of maximizing her coins, and the story is kept concise by focusing solely on the necessary actions.
