To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to move to a location where he can potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

By executing these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires, which is a direct result of his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition to a location where he can confront Bambi.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, which is one of the two possible endings.
