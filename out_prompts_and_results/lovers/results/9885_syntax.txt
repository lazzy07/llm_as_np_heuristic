To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate the next actions.

2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Casey actually wants the jewelry (I3). However, this action is necessary to create a misunderstanding that will lead to the next steps.

3. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves from the bathroom (R12) to the bedroom (R11). This is necessary for Alex to pick up the item they believe is the chocolates (I2).

4. **pick_up(C1, I2, R11)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the bedroom (R11). This is necessary because Alex believes they need to get the item that Casey mentioned.

5. **move(C1, R11, R22)**: Alex moves from the bedroom (R11) to the dining room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to give the item to Casey.

6. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey in the dining room (R22). This is necessary because it allows Casey to have the item they want, which is the chocolates.

7. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Alex for the jewelry (I3) with Blake. This is necessary because it allows Blake to get the jewelry they want.

8. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex. This is necessary because it allows Alex to have the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry (I2), which is what they wanted.
