**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** 
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. By assessing, Hathaway can identify if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** 
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (since he has a fever), Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones actually has Flaze, he will become healthy. This action is crucial for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring patient health.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.** 
   - After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to check on Ross, who is still in Admissions. This action is necessary to continue the process of assessing and treating all patients.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** 
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Hathaway can then assess him. This is essential for ensuring that Ross receives the necessary treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** 
   - This action allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms, which are also currently unknown. 

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** 
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway administers steroids. If Ross actually has Jarkis, he will become healthy. This is the final step to ensure all patients are healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A.** 
   - Finally, Hathaway checks on Young in Patient Room A to ensure he is also healthy.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** 
   - Assuming Young has Flaze, Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Young actually has Flaze, he will become healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
