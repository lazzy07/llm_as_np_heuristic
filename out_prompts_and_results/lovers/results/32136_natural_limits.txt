In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is already happy with the jewelry. To help Blake achieve their goal of happiness, the following action takes place:

1. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.** This action is necessary because it allows Blake to relinquish the flowers, which Alex wants. By doing this, Blake can then focus on finding the chocolates, which is their desired item.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry.

However, since the goal is for Blake to achieve happiness, Blake can now move to the next step in the story to find the chocolates.

In this case, the story is minimal, focusing solely on the action that allows Blake to progress towards their goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Blake gives the flowers to Alex:** This action is crucial because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy. Although Blake does not achieve happiness immediately, this action sets the stage for Blake to pursue their own happiness by potentially seeking out the chocolates in the next steps.
