**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take action to help both himself and Ernest. He knows that the bully is a threat, especially since he has already threatened both of them. 

1. **Action: Go to the Hallway (Roy)**  
   Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway. This action is necessary for him to access the gym and potentially confront the bully.

2. **Action: Vent (Roy, Gym)**  
   Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym. This allows him to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, reducing the risk of being threatened.

   Once inside the gym, Roy locks the door. This action prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference.

4. **Action: Kill (Bully, Roy, Gym)**  
   With the bully trapped and unable to threaten him, Roy uses the knife he has to kill the bully. This action eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest.

5. **Action: Disguise (Roy, Clothes, Hall)**  
   After dealing with the bully, Roy returns to the hallway and puts on the civilian clothes he found in the laundry. This disguise will help him escape the prison.
