To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to give away.

2. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves from the bathroom (R21) to the dining room (R12). This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.

4. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the bathroom (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to clear the way for the next action.

5. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R12) to be with Casey and receive the jewelry.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry, making them happy.
