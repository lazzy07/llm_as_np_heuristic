In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (the flowers). 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Casey and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to receive an item, which may help in making Casey happy, and it also allows Blake to take the item that Casey has, which is the flowers (I1).

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R21) with the chocolates. This action is necessary for Casey to be in a position to interact with Alex.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21). This is the final action that ensures Alex receives the item they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

By following this sequence, Blake achieves their goal of ensuring Alex is happy by giving them the flowers they desire.
