Ernest is on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes, having successfully crawled through the vents to escape the prison. He knows that he needs to get away from the prison and the threats posed by the bully. Since he is already on the highway and disguised, he can simply escape from the prison.

**Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)**

This action is necessary because it allows Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free from threats. He is already in the right location and has the disguise needed to avoid detection.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["escape(Ernest, Highway)"]
}
