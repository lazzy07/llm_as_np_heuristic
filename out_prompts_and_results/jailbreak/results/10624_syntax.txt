**Story Completion:**

1. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**  
   - Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This action is crucial as it allows him to disguise himself and prepares him for a potential escape.

2. **Action: go(Roy, Highway)**  
   - After disguising himself, Roy moves from the hallway to the highway. This is necessary for him to reach the outside of the prison where he can escape.

3. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)**  
   - Finally, Roy escapes from the prison using the civilian clothes disguise. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising is essential because without the civilian clothes, Roy would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would not be able to escape. 
- The second action of moving to the highway is necessary as it is the only location where he can escape after disguising himself.
- The last action of escaping is the culmination of his efforts to achieve freedom and safety.
