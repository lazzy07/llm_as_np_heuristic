To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant's coin is located.

2. **The bandit robs the hero.**  
   - The bandit can rob the hero because the hero is carrying the medicine and the merchant's sword, but not a sword of their own. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the hero, which is not the goal but is a necessary step to distract the hero.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After robbing the hero, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to access the bandit camp.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action allows the bandit to reach the camp where the coins are stored.

5. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the hero and take the medicine, which serves as a distraction and allows the bandit to assert dominance.
- By robbing the hero, the bandit not only takes an item but also creates chaos, making it easier to escape.
- The bandit then returns to the crossroads and proceeds to the camp, where the coins are stored, ensuring that they can achieve their goal of accumulating wealth.
