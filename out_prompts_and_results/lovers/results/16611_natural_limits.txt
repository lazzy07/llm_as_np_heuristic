In the living room, Alex sees that Casey has the flowers. Knowing that Alex wants the flowers to be happy, Alex decides to take action. 

**Action: Alex tells Casey that the jewelry is wanted.**  
- This action is included because Alex wants to create a situation where Casey might be willing to trade the flowers for the jewelry, which Casey believes is with Blake. 

**Action: Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
- This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, while Casey is not happy because they have given away the flowers but still wants the jewelry.

**Final Explanation:**  
The story is kept short and focused on Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers. The first action sets up a potential trade, and the second action directly achieves Alex's goal.
