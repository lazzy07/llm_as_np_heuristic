**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows that the bully believes he is still in the laundry room, which gives him a chance to escape. 

1. **Ernest moves to the highway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to escape the prison, as he needs to be outside.)
2. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (This action is the final step for Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Moving to the highway:** This action is crucial because it allows Ernest to leave the confines of the prison. Since he is already disguised, he can blend in once he reaches the outside.
- **Escaping from the prison:** This is the ultimate goal for Ernest. By escaping, he ensures his survival and freedom, which aligns with his desire to be alive and not threatened.
