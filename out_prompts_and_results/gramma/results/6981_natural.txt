To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit needs to leave the cottage to interact with Tom and the merchant.

2. **The bandit reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - The bandit believes she is at the cottage, but she needs to create a distraction. By reporting her own location, she can mislead the guard into thinking she is still at the cottage, allowing her to move freely.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - The guard believes the bandit is at the cottage and goes there to confront her, leaving the market.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - The bandit now moves to the cottage to retrieve the medicine from the merchant.

5. **The bandit robs the merchant and takes the medicine.**  
   - The bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, who is unarmed, and takes the medicine, which is essential for Tom.

6. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit now has the medicine and needs to return to Tom.

7. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - The bandit returns to the cottage to drop off the medicine.

8. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**

At the end of these actions, Tom is at the cottage with the medicine.
