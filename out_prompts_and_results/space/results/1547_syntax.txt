To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action initiates the eruption of the volcano on the surface, making the environment dangerous and setting the stage for the impending disaster.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact further.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave. This action allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which results in the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface when the eruption occurs.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying (Zoe), and both characters (Zoe and the Lizard) becoming friends.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe to the cave to interact with the Lizard.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, resulting in Zoe's death.
