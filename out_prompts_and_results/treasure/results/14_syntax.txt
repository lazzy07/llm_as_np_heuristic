After Hawkins spreads the rumor about the treasure being buried on the island, both he and Silver sail to the island. Once they arrive, Hawkins digs up the treasure, and since Silver believes the treasure is on the island, he can take it.

However, to ensure Silver achieves his goal, the story will conclude with Silver taking the treasure instead of Hawkins. 

Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **sail()** - Hawkins and Silver work together to sail from the port to the island. This action is necessary as it gets them to the location where the treasure is buried.
   
2. **dig()** - Hawkins digs up the treasure. This action is essential because it reveals the treasure that both characters desire.

3. **take(Silver, Treasure)** - Silver takes the treasure. This action ensures that Silver achieves his goal of obtaining the treasure.

In this sequence, Hawkins helps Silver by digging up the treasure, but ultimately, it is Silver who takes it, fulfilling his desire for the treasure.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
