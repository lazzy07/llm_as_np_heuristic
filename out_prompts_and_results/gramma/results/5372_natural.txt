**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, armed with her sword and having just looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to attack the guard. The bandit believes that by eliminating the guard, she can secure her position and avoid any threats to her goal of acquiring coins.

2. The bandit attacks the guard and successfully kills him. This action is crucial as it removes the only armed character who could pose a threat to her plans.

3. After killing the guard, the bandit loots the guard's corpse and takes the guard's sword. This action not only provides her with an additional weapon but also ensures that she is now better equipped to defend herself against any future threats.

4. With the guard dead and the crossroads clear, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the medicine and any coins she may acquire later.

5. The bandit now has the medicine and is in a secure location (the bandit camp), fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
