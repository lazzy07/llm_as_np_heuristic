To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront Tom, who is currently there and has just been robbed of a coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to interact with Tom and potentially take more coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, taking the coin that Tom has. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count, helping her achieve her goal.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the Bandit Camp where she can store her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.
