**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, he dies from the incorrect treatment.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now realizing the mistake, walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, where he will be assessed next.

5. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Young, however, has Flaze and dies from the incorrect treatment.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones.

8. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

9. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Jones, however, has Flaze and dies from the incorrect treatment.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is not achieved, as all patients die due to her mistakes. However, she did attempt to treat all patients, which aligns with her goal of wanting them to be healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Ross and Young was necessary to determine their conditions, even though mistakes were made due to the high workload.
- Treating Ross and Young was an attempt to help them, even though the treatments were incorrect.
- Walking to Admissions was necessary to continue assessing the remaining patient, Jones.
