To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, assesses and treats both patients in exam room A (Ross and Jones) and the patient in exam room B (Young) correctly, so that all patients become healthy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Flaze, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, he will not make a mistake in diagnosing Ross.
   
2. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Flaze, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones next to determine his symptoms. Again, with a workload of 2, he will accurately diagnose Jones.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Jarkis, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway then assesses Young in exam room B. He will correctly diagnose Young as having Jarkis.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Ross and determining he has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics as well, since he also has Flaze.

6. **Treat Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis.

By following this sequence, all patients will be treated correctly and will become healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Ross and Jones**: This is necessary to determine their symptoms and ensure they receive the correct treatment.
- **Assessing Young**: This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.
- **Treating Ross and Jones with antibiotics**: This is the correct treatment for their diagnosed disease, Flaze.
- **Treating Young with steroids**: This is the correct treatment for his diagnosed disease, Jarkis.
