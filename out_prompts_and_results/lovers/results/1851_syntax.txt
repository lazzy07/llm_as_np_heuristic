To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up and eventually give them to Casey.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This action is essential as it allows Blake to have the item that Casey wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Casey is. This is necessary for Blake to give the chocolates to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action is crucial because it fulfills Casey's desire for chocolates, making Casey happy.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to pick up the jewelry.

6. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry. This action is essential as it allows Casey to have the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
