**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently unassigned to any exam room. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms so Hathaway can provide the appropriate treatment. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If he shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross's health.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is essential because Hathaway needs to know what symptoms Ross is exhibiting to provide the correct treatment. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot make an informed decision about how to help Ross.

- **Treat Ross**: This action is the culmination of Hathaway's goal to ensure all patients are healthy. By treating Ross with the correct medication based on his symptoms, Hathaway can successfully help him recover.
