Tom is at the Crossroads, carrying the medicine he purchased from the merchant. He knows that the merchant is at the market, and the bandit is also there, likely looking to steal coins. Tom decides to take action to ensure he can safely return to the cottage with the medicine.

To achieve his goal, Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is also at the market. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the presence of a criminal, which could lead to the bandit being apprehended. By doing this, Tom ensures that he can safely return to the cottage without the threat of being robbed or attacked by the bandit.

After reporting, Tom can confidently walk back to the cottage, knowing that the guard will deal with the bandit.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **report(Tom, Market, Market)** - Tom reports the bandit's location to the guard, ensuring that the bandit is dealt with.

Now, Tom can safely walk back to the cottage with the medicine.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)** - Tom walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.

The story is complete, and Tom has successfully reached the cottage with the medicine.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "report(Tom, Market, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine while ensuring his safety from the bandit.
