Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave.** - This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, as the cave may provide shelter from the impending eruption.

2. **The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave.** - The Lizard wants to stay close to Zoe, as they are friends and both need to be safe. By following Zoe, the Lizard ensures they are together in a safer location.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in a safe location strengthens their relationship and ensures they can work together to stay safe.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have moved to the cave, ensuring they are safe from the eruption. 

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
