In the cave, Rory, who has the treasure, realizes that Talia is unhappy despite their marriage. He wants to help her achieve happiness. Gargax, feeling hungry, sees Rory and decides to eat him to satisfy his hunger. 

1. Gargax eats Rory. (This action is necessary because it removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her own happiness without the complication of Rory's presence.)
2. Talia picks up the treasure from Rory's dead body. (This action allows Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her goals, and it also contributes to her happiness since she now has something valuable.)

With the treasure in her possession, Talia feels a sense of accomplishment and wealth, leading her to become happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is crucial as it eliminates Rory, who, while married to Talia, is not contributing to her happiness. By removing him, Talia can focus on her own desires.
- **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, which in turn leads to her happiness.
