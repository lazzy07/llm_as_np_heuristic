Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the surface, is also in danger. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard with a peaceful intention. 

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goal of safety and health. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they can work together to find safety.

2. **Walk to the Cave**: After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave, where they can find shelter from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are safe from the immediate danger of the surface.

By making peace with the Lizard and moving to a safe location, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
