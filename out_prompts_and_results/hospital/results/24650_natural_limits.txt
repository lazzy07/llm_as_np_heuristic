**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room C, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. With a workload of 3, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload. Despite this error, Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis but instead has Flaze, which means the treatment is ineffective. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, he does not die from the treatment error. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. Ross, now assigned to an exam room, can be assessed and treated later. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to check on Jones again, ensuring he is still alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Although Hathaway makes a mistake due to the high workload, it is essential to attempt to diagnose the patient.
   
2. **Treat Jones with steroids**: This action is crucial as it represents the doctor's attempt to help Jones. Even though it is the wrong treatment, it is a necessary step in the process of trying to achieve Jones's health.

3. **Walk to Admissions and admit Ross**: This action is taken to ensure that all patients are being attended to, which is part of Dr. Hathaway's goal of keeping all patients healthy. It also sets up the next steps for Ross's treatment.
