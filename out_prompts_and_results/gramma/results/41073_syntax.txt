To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Tom's success:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the Cottage.

This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal, as he already has the medicine in his possession after looting it from the Merchant. 

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to move to his desired location (the Cottage) while carrying the medicine. Since he is not in danger from the Bandit or the Guard at this moment, he can safely make this journey.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the Cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal efficiently.
