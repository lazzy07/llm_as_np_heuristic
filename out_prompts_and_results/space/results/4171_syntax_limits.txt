Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the danger around her. She knows that to achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, she needs to take action. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to walk with the Lizard to the cave, where they can find shelter from the dangers of the surface.

**Action:**
- walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)

**Explanation:**
This action is taken because it allows Zoe to move to a safer location (the cave) with the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring both characters remain healthy and safe. By walking together, they can bond further, which aligns with both of their goals of making friends.
