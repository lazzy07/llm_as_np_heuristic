Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano on the surface. They realize that they need to work together to ensure their safety and to forge a friendship. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to understand the Lizard and the planet better. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, accepts her offer, and they become friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are no longer enemies.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano erupts violently. The eruption is a natural consequence of the earlier action that began the eruption process. This action leads to the danger that will ultimately result in a character's demise.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, now a friend of Zoe, is caught in the eruption and tragically dies. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

In this story, the actions taken lead to the desired outcomes: the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe and the Lizard manage to become friends just before the tragedy strikes.
