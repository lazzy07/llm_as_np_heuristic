To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are currently not fighting, this action can succeed.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is currently dangerous, but she needs to be there to explore and potentially interact with the Lizard further.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will also walk to the surface. This action is important because it shows that the Lizard is willing to follow Zoe and engage with her in a safe environment.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will begin to erupt. This action introduces a sense of urgency and danger, but since both characters are now friends, they can work together to ensure their safety.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is necessary to conclude the story, as it creates a dramatic climax. However, since both characters are friends, they can help each other escape the danger.

6. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe will teleport to her spaceship for safety. This action is essential for her to ensure her health and safety.

7. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: The Lizard will also teleport to the spaceship. This action ensures that both characters are safe and can continue their friendship in a secure environment.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
