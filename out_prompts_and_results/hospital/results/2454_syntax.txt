4. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room A to Exam Room B**: Hathaway needs to move to Exam Room B to assess Ross.
