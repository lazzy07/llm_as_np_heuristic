To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he is hungry and greedy. He believes that the bank clerk has money, and he is aware of Bambi's presence in the forest. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either shoot Bambi or threaten the bank clerk later.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi. This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi, which will satisfy his hunger and also lead to Bambi being dead.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats Bambi. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba then goes to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have both satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi and acquired the money from the bank clerk.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Eliminates Bambi, allowing Bubba to eat and fulfill his hunger.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger after killing Bambi.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
