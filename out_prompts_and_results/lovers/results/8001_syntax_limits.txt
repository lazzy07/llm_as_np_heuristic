In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and they are aware that Casey (C3) has it. However, Casey wants the flowers (I3), which Alex currently has. Blake (C2) is also in the room but is not directly involved in the exchange of items.

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to trade the item they have (the flowers) with Casey for the item they want (the jewelry). This will make Alex happy because they will have the jewelry, and Casey will also be happy because they will receive the flowers.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Alex obtaining the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry.
- Casey will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake's happiness is not directly affected by this trade, but they are still supportive of Alex.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness with the minimum number of actions.
