To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit loots the merchant's corpse to take the medicine. 
   - This action is necessary because the bandit wants to ensure that the merchant's items are taken, and the medicine could be valuable or useful for future dealings.

2. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.
   - This action is necessary to return to the bandit camp, where the bandit can store the coins and the medicine.

3. The bandit places the hero's coin and the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.
   - This action is necessary to fulfill the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest and to secure the medicine for future use.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible and having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
