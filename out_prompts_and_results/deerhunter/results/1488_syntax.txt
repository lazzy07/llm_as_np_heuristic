To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to acquire the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he is currently located and go to the bank. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle he has. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to acquire the money without needing to shoot the clerk, as he is already armed.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to keep it. This action solidifies his intention to possess the money he has just taken.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten Bambi, to the bank, where the money is located.
  
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money without needing to resort to violence.

- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action confirms Bubba's greed and desire to possess the money he has stolen, ensuring that he ends up with it.

With these actions, we achieve the goal of having Bubba with the money, while Bambi remains dead.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
