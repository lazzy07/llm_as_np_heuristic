**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. Roy sneaks into the kitchen and grabs the knife, knowing it could be his only chance to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.

With the knife in hand, Roy moves to the hallway, where he can hear the bully's laughter echoing from the gym. He locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action not only secures their safety but also gives Roy the upper hand. 

Now, with the bully locked in, Roy enters the gym and confronts him. In a moment of desperation, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest will no longer be threatened. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now focus on escaping the prison with Ernest.
