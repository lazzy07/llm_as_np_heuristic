To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to increase his wealth, as the treasure is located at the cave.

2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to go to the village to be in a location where he can potentially use or display his newfound wealth.

3. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant for achieving happiness, but it reinforces his commitment to Talia.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**  
   - This action is also redundant since they are already married, but it ensures that Vince's happiness is acknowledged.

5. **Vince and Talia get married.**  
   - This action is redundant as they are already married, but it solidifies their relationship and contributes to Vince's happiness.

6. **Vince becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of not being hungry, as Vince will need to eat to satisfy this requirement.

7. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Gargax's travel is not directly related to Vince's goals but is necessary to maintain the story's flow.

8. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is the final event that leads to Vince's demise, but it is essential to conclude the story.

After these actions, Vince will have achieved his goal of being wealthy (due to the treasure) and not hungry (as he will have been eaten, thus no longer experiencing hunger). However, he will not be happy due to his death.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.",
    "Vince travels from the cave to the village.",
    "Vince proposes marriage to Talia.",
    "Talia accepts Vince's proposal.",
    "Vince and Talia get married.",
    "Vince becomes hungry.",
    "Gargax travels from the village to the cave.",
    "Gargax eats Vince."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Vince achieves his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, albeit at the cost of his life, which is a necessary conclusion to the story.
