To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, we can follow these actions:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is currently at the Cottage and needs to move to the Crossroads to reach the Market. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to be in a position to interact with Tom later.

2. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Merchant is at the Market and needs to walk to the Cottage to deliver the medicine to Tom. This action is crucial because it allows Tom to receive the medicine he desires.

After these actions, Tom will be at the Cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows the Bandit to move away from the Cottage, which is important to prevent any potential conflict with Tom, who is trying to achieve his goal peacefully.
- The second action is essential as it directly leads to Tom receiving the medicine from the Merchant, thus completing his objective.
