To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard and initiate contact.
2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located, showing her willingness to engage and explore.
3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship and ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.
4. **Walk from Cave to Surface**: Zoe walks back to the surface, indicating her desire to stay in the area and continue building the friendship.
5. **Erupt (Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is now friends with the Lizard, they can work together to find safety.
6. **Teleport to Ship (Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the ship, ensuring her safety from the eruption.

This sequence of actions allows Zoe to achieve her goals of health, safety, and friendship with the Lizard while navigating the dangers of the planet.
