To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can take the coin that Tom is carrying. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp and take the coins that are in the chest. This action ensures that the Bandit maximizes her coin collection.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by robbing Tom and then taking the coins from the chest at the camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial because it allows the Bandit to gain an additional coin, which contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the bandit camp.
