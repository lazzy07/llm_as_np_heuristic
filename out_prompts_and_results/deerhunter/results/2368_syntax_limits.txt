To achieve the goal of having Bubba end up with the money or ensuring Bambi is dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will steal the money from the bank clerk. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to intimidate the clerk into giving up the money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is already dead, Bubba can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal of acquiring money, but it fulfills Bubba's hunger.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary to achieve the goal of Bubba having the money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, who is already dead. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, but it is not essential for the primary goal of acquiring money.

In this scenario, Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk, and Bambi is confirmed dead, fulfilling both conditions of the goal.
