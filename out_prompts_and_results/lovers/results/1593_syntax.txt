To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the flowers (I1) in the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to show that Alex is now in possession of the flowers.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where they can interact with the other characters if needed. This action is included to show Alex's presence in the room with the other characters.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to check on the flowers. This action is included to show Blake's concern for Alex's happiness.

6. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey also moves to the dining room (R21) to see what Blake is doing. This action is included to show Casey's involvement in the situation.

At this point, Alex has the flowers (I1) and is happy. The other characters can still interact, but Alex's goal has been achieved.
