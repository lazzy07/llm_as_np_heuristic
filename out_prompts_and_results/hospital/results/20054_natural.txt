**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him yet. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload is still low, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2, but it allows Ross to be assigned to an exam room for assessment.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Like Jones, Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway cannot diagnose him either.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This increases the workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has assessed all patients, but since their symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot treat them correctly. However, the goal of ensuring all patients are in exam rooms has been achieved.
