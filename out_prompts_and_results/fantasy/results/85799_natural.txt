To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and it will lead to Rory's death. Although this seems counterintuitive, it is the only way for Rory to achieve happiness through the story's structure, as he is married to Talia, who is at the cave, and they can only be happy if they are together.

2. **Talia takes the treasure from Rory's dead body**: After Rory is eaten, Talia can take the treasure from Rory's body. This action is essential because it allows Talia to gain wealth, which is a step towards her happiness.

3. **Talia travels to the village**: Talia will then travel to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary for her to be in a new location where she can potentially find happiness.

4. **Talia proposes to Vince**: Talia proposes to Vince, which is a necessary action to create a new relationship that can lead to happiness.

5. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal**: Vince accepts the proposal, which is essential for both characters to achieve happiness.

6. **Talia and Vince get married**: This action solidifies their relationship, leading to both characters being happy.

7. **Talia gives Vince the treasure**: Talia gives Vince the treasure, which fulfills his desire for wealth and ensures he is not hungry.

By following these actions, Rory's goal of being happy is achieved through the relationships formed and the wealth acquired by Talia and Vince.
