The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and successfully killed her, now stands in the market with the merchant's sword and the medicine that the hero had purchased. The bandit knows that the guard is at the crossroads and is unaware of the events that have transpired. 

To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit decides to loot the merchant's corpse for the hero's coin. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to acquire the coin without drawing the guard's attention, as the guard is not present in the market.

The bandit approaches the merchant's body and takes the hero's coin, adding it to her own stash in the chest at the bandit camp. With this action, the bandit successfully increases her wealth without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the guard.
