In this story, Bubba is driven by greed and hunger, and he has already picked up a rifle and ammunition. He is currently in the forest, where he encounters Bambi, the deer. The goal is to either have Bubba end up with the money or for Bambi to be dead.

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger, and it also eliminates Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is one of his immediate needs.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba's greed drives him to decide to get money. Since he has already expressed a desire for money, this action reinforces his goal of acquiring wealth.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba satisfying his hunger by eating Bambi, which also results in Bambi being dead. The story ends with Bubba having achieved his goals of satisfying his hunger and eliminating Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to achieve the ending where either Bubba has the money or Bambi is dead, and in this case, both conditions are met through the actions taken.
