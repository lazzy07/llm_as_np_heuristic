**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young, who is currently in Admissions and has not been assigned to an exam room yet. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is in Patient Room B.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Unknown.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's condition.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** (Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway assumes the worst-case scenario and treats Young for Jarkis, which is the only other disease. This is a risk but necessary to ensure Young's health.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.** (Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones, who is now in Patient Room C.)
6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition.)
7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids.** (Again, since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway treats him for Jarkis to ensure his health.)
8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.** (Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Ross.)
9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** (Since Ross has a fever, Dr. Hathaway correctly treats him for Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

By the end of these actions, all patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to either admit, assess, or treat patients, which are the necessary steps to ensure their health.
- The risk of treating patients with unknown symptoms is taken to prevent any potential deterioration of their health.
- The sequence of actions ensures that Dr. Hathaway's workload remains manageable, allowing for accurate assessments and treatments.
