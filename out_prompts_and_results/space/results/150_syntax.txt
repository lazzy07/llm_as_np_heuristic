Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of them can be safe and healthy. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe decides to approach the Lizard in the cave and extend a hand of friendship. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy and safe, and it helps to build a relationship rather than escalate into conflict.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to physically reach the Lizard and solidify their newfound friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she again expresses her desire to be friends with the Lizard. This reinforces their bond and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard, now feeling more comfortable with Zoe, decides to walk back to the surface with her. This action signifies their growing friendship and mutual trust.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are on the surface, the volcano erupts. However, since they are now friends, they work together to find a safe place to avoid the lava flow, ensuring both of them remain safe.

By the end of these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard have achieved their goals of being healthy, safe, and having made a friend.
