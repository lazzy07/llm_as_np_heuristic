The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market and decides to take action. She knows that the guard is a threat to her plans, so she quickly attacks the guard, who is not expecting an assault. The guard, unprepared for the attack, is killed. With the guard out of the way, the bandit loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword and any coins he might have had. 

Now, with the guard dead and the market clear, the bandit walks to the chest at the bandit camp, where she places the coins she has taken from the hero and the guard. This fulfills her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the guard**: The bandit needs to eliminate the guard to ensure her safety and to prevent him from interfering with her plans. 
2. **Loot the guard's corpse**: After killing the guard, the bandit takes advantage of the situation to gather more coins, which helps her achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.
3. **Walk to the bandit camp**: Finally, the bandit moves to the bandit camp to secure her coins in the chest, completing her objective.
