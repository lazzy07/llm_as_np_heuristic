**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, symptom: fever, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient assigned to this room, Hathaway can focus on him. This action is crucial to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, treatment: antibiotics, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: After assessing Jones and finding that he has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomC**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room C. This is important to check for any symptoms Young may have, as he is the only patient in that room.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment: steroids, room: PatientRoomC**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

**Final Explanation:**
The actions taken ensure that both Jones and Young are assessed and treated correctly based on their symptoms. By treating Jones with antibiotics for Flaze and Young with steroids for Jarkis, Hathaway successfully achieves the goal of making all patients healthy.
