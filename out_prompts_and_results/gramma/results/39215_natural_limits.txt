The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant at the market holding the medicine. Knowing that the merchant is unarmed and unable to defend herself, the bandit decides to attack the merchant. 

The bandit attacks the merchant, successfully killing her and taking the medicine. With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she can now also loot the merchant's coins.
