Tom, realizing the danger of the bandit at the crossroads, decides to take action. He quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. The guard, armed and ready, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to get to the cottage carrying the medicine. By reporting the bandit, he ensures that the guard can deal with the threat, allowing him to safely retrieve the medicine from the merchant's corpse.

After the guard arrives at the crossroads, he confronts the bandit and, being armed, he attacks and kills her. With the bandit defeated, the guard can now safely retrieve the medicine from the merchant's body.

Tom then walks to the crossroads, where he finds the guard and the merchant's body. He takes the medicine, fulfilling his goal of carrying it back to the cottage.

The story concludes with Tom successfully achieving his goal.
