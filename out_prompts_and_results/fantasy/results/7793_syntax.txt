To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her current situation and the available actions. Talia is already married to Rory, which makes her happy. However, she currently has no wealth. The only way for Talia to become wealthy is to acquire the money that Vince has, as he is dead and can no longer use it.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary because it allows Talia to acquire wealth, which is one of her goals.

After this action, Talia will have the money, making her wealthy. Since she is already happy from her marriage to Rory, she will have achieved both of her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action is crucial as it allows Talia to gain the money that Vince had. Since Vince is dead, Talia can take the money without any conflict. This directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia achieves her goals of happiness and wealth in the shortest possible way.
