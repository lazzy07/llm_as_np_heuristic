**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room C with Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, they can still assess and treat Jones without making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.
   
2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: Hathaway then admits Ross to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated next, as he is still in the admissions room.

4. **Walk to Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway walks to Exam Room A to assess Ross. This is the next logical step to continue providing care to the patients.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring he is healthy, and prepares to treat Ross next.
