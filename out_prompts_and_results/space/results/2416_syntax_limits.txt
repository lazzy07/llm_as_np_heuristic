In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are both in the cave, and they are not fighting. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Since both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of their goals.

After making peace, the volcano erupts, which is a natural consequence of the earlier action to begin the eruption. Since both characters are in the cave, they are safe from the eruption, but the surface becomes uninhabitable, fulfilling the condition of the story.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action is taken to ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, aligning with their mutual goals of safety and friendship.
2. **erupt(Surface)**: This action represents the volcano erupting, which is a consequence of the earlier action to begin the eruption. It also serves to illustrate the danger of the surface.

The final outcome is that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, and the volcano erupts, making the surface uninhabitable.
