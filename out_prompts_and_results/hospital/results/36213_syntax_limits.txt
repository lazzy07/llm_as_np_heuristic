To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients in the exam rooms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they are at risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat more than one patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to assess and treat one patient at a time.

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is already in Exam Room A, this action is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the identified symptoms. If Young has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze, and if they have a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these two actions, Hathaway can effectively manage their workload and ensure that at least one patient is treated correctly, achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat Young without exceeding their workload, thus maintaining the goal of patient health.
