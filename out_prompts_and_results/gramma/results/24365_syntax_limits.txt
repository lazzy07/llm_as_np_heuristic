Tom is in the Market, carrying the Medicine he just acquired from the Merchant. He knows that the Bandit is likely hiding nearby, possibly at the Bandit Camp, and he wants to ensure he can safely return to the Cottage with the Medicine. 

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the location of the Bandit to the Guard, who is also in the Market. This action will alert the Guard to the Bandit's presence, allowing the Guard to take action against the Bandit, thus ensuring Tom's safe passage back to the Cottage.

**Action:**
1. report(Tom, location(Bandit), Market)

This action is necessary because it directly contributes to Tom's goal of safely returning to the Cottage with the Medicine. By reporting the Bandit, Tom ensures that the Guard can deal with the threat, allowing him to leave the Market without fear of being robbed or attacked.

**Final Plan:**
```json

  "plan": ["report(Tom, location(Bandit), Market)"]
}
