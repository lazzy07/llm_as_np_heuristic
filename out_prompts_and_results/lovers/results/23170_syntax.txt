1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (R22) to interact with them.
   - **Reason**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and potentially trade items.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) that are in the bathroom (R22).
   - **Reason**: Casey needs to have the flowers in their possession to give them to Alex.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where Alex is located.
   - **Reason**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the flowers.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex.
   - **Reason**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have obtained the flowers they wanted.
