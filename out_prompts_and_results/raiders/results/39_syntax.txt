To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring that the Nazis are dead. Given the current situation, the Nazis are already dead, and the US Army has the Ark, but we need to ensure that the story reflects the actions taken to achieve this outcome.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis, believing they can still pursue the Ark, attempt to travel to the USA. However, since they are already dead, this action is moot and serves to reinforce their inability to act further.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army, now in possession of the Ark, decides to open it. They believe it is safe, but since the Ark is actually dangerous, this action results in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it.

3. **status(USArmy) = Dead**: The US Army is now dead after opening the Ark, which was dangerous.

At this point, the story reflects that the US Army has the Ark, but they are dead, and the Nazis are also dead. However, since the goal is to have the US Army alive with the Ark, we need to adjust the actions to ensure that the US Army remains alive.

To achieve the desired ending, we can modify the actions as follows:

1. **travel(Jones, USA, Tanis)**: Indiana Jones travels back to Tanis to confront the Nazis.
2. **take(Jones, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: Indiana takes the Ark from the Nazis, ensuring they cannot use it.
3. **open(Jones, Ark, Tanis)**: Indiana opens the Ark, which is dangerous, resulting in the death of the Nazis.
4. **travel(Jones, Tanis, USA)**: Indiana travels back to the USA with the Ark.
5. **give(Jones, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: Indiana gives the Ark to the US Army.

Now, the US Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Jones, USA, Tanis)**: Indiana needs to confront the Nazis to ensure they cannot use the Ark.
- **take(Jones, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: This action secures the Ark from the Nazis, preventing them from using it for their immortality.
- **open(Jones, Ark, Tanis)**: Indiana opens the Ark, which is dangerous, leading to the demise of the Nazis, ensuring they cannot pursue their goals.
- **travel(Jones, Tanis, USA)**: Indiana returns to the USA with the Ark, ensuring it is safe from the Nazis.
- **give(Jones, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: This final action ensures that the US Army has the Ark, fulfilling Indiana's goal.
