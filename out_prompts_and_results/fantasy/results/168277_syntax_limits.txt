In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and wants to be wealthy. The quickest way for Gargax to achieve this goal is to eat a human who is at the same location, as this will not only satisfy his hunger but also allow him to take any items the human has, potentially increasing his wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, who is in the cave with him. This action satisfies Gargax's hunger and allows him to take any items Rory had, which includes the money.

After this action, Gargax will have satisfied his hunger and gained wealth from the money Rory possessed.
