In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is currently with Casey, C2), and Blake knows that Alex is unhappy because they do not have the item they want. 

To achieve their goal, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade item I1 (which is currently with Casey) for item I3 (which is with Casey). This will make Alex happy because they will receive the item they want.

Hereâ€™s the story:

Blake, seeing that Alex is unhappy, decides to trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. Blake approaches Casey and proposes the trade. Casey, wanting to make Blake happy, agrees to the trade. After the trade, Alex receives the flowers and is happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.

### Explanation of the action:
- **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: This action allows Blake to give the jewelry they have to Casey in exchange for the flowers that Casey has. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Alex receiving the item they want, thus achieving Blake's goal of making Alex happy.
