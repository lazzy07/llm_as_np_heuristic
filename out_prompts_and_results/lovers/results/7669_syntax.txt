To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex (C1) achieves their goal of being happy, which they can do by having the item they want (I1). Since Alex is already happy (as indicated in the current situation), we need to focus on making sure that Casey (C3) and Blake (C2) also achieve their happiness.

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the bedroom where Alex is. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.
   
2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the bedroom. This action is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates to be happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom to be with Alex and Blake. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to receive the chocolates.

4. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I3) to Blake (C2) in the bedroom. This action is necessary because Blake wants the flowers to be happy.

5. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is necessary for Alex to be with both characters.

6. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake and Casey trade items in the living room. This action is necessary because it allows both characters to achieve their happiness by getting the items they want.

After these actions, all characters will be happy: 
- Alex has I1 (jewelry) and is happy.
- Blake has I3 (flowers) and is happy.
- Casey has I2 (chocolates) and is happy.

### Explanation of Each Action:
1. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake needs to be with Alex to help them achieve their goals.
2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives chocolates to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire.
3. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey needs to be with Blake to receive the chocolates.
4. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives flowers to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire.
5. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to be with both characters.
6. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: This final trade allows both Blake and Casey to achieve their happiness.
