Tom is at the crossroads, aware that the merchant has the medicine he needs. The bandit, armed and dangerous, is also at the crossroads. To achieve his goal of getting the medicine and returning to the cottage, Tom decides to take a bold action.

Tom, realizing he is unarmed and at a disadvantage, quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. This action is crucial because it brings the guard to the crossroads, where he can confront the bandit. 

The guard, upon receiving the report, rushes to the crossroads, where he finds the bandit. The guard, armed with his sword, attacks the bandit, successfully killing her. With the bandit defeated, Tom can now safely retrieve the medicine from the merchant's corpse.

Tom picks up the medicine from the merchant and, with his goal achieved, walks back to the cottage.
