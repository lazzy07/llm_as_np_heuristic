To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom bought from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without directly attacking Tom, who is armed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully robs the Merchant and then moves to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins safely.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without risking a confrontation with Tom, who is armed. The Bandit needs coins to achieve her goal.
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to reach her preferred location, the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins.
