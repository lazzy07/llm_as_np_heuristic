In the village, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. Since she is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness is secured. However, she currently has no wealth.

To achieve her goal of wealth, Talia can take the following actions:

1. **Vince gives Talia the money**: Since Vince has the money and he wants to help Talia, he can choose to give her the money. This action will make Talia wealthy.

2. **Talia travels to the cave**: After receiving the money, Talia can travel to the cave to seek out the treasure, which will further increase her wealth.

With these two actions, Talia will achieve her goal of being wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Vince gives Talia the money**: This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth, and Vince has the money. By giving it to Talia, she becomes wealthy.
- **Talia travels to the cave**: This action is included to allow Talia to pursue the treasure, which will enhance her wealth even further, solidifying her goal of being wealthy.
