Zoe, realizing that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport from the ship to the surface one last time. She hopes to find the Lizard and help it escape the impending eruption. 

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard struggling to find safety. Instead of attacking or teleporting back to the ship, Zoe approaches the Lizard and offers her assistance. The Lizard, initially wary, recognizes Zoe's intentions and accepts her help. They work together to find a safe path away from the volcano, and in the process, they bond over their shared desire for safety and friendship.
