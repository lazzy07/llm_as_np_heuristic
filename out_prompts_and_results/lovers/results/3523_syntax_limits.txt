To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Given the current situation, Alex is in the dining room (R12) and has the jewelry (I3). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is the item they want to be happy.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, fulfilling their goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: This action allows Alex to give away the jewelry they have to Casey in exchange for the flowers. Since Casey wants the jewelry (as inferred from the situation), this trade benefits both characters, but primarily fulfills Alex's goal of happiness.
