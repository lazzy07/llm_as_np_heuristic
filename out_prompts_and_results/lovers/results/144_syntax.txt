To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can create a sequence of actions that allows for the necessary trades and movements. Hereâ€™s the shortest story:

1. **Casey moves to the dining room (R21 to R22)**: This allows Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake, who are currently in the dining room.
   
2. **Casey tells Alex that Blake wants the flowers (I1)**: This is a strategic lie to manipulate the situation, as it may prompt Alex to act in a way that benefits Casey.

3. **Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R22)**: Alex believes Casey's statement and picks up the flowers, thinking it will make Blake happy.

4. **Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Blake (R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Blake, believing it will make Blake happy.

5. **Blake, now happy with the flowers, decides to trade the jewelry (I3) with Casey for the chocolates (I2)**: Since Blake is happy, they are willing to trade their jewelry for something they believe is valuable.

6. **Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (R22)**: This completes the trade, allowing Casey to receive the jewelry.

7. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from Blake (R22)**: Now that the trade is complete, Casey picks up the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
