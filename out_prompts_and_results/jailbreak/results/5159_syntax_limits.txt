**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened. To ensure his safety and to escape the prison, he decides to take a calculated risk. 

Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he knows the bully is. Once inside, he locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. With the knife he stole from the kitchen, he confronts the bully. In a moment of desperation and self-defense, Ernest kills the bully. 

Now that the threat is eliminated, Ernest quickly makes his way back to the hallway. He puts on the civilian clothes he found in the laundry room, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he heads to the highway outside the prison. 

Finally, Ernest escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
