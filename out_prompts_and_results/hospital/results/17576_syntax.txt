To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC, they will first assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Ross. This is important to check Ross's symptoms as well, ensuring that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Finally, Hathaway will walk back to PatientRoomA to assess Young. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures Ross's health as well.

6. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are treated and healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, achieving their goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy.
