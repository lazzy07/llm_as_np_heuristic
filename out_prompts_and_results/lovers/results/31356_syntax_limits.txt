In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and they believe that Casey (C3) has it. Since Alex is currently in the same room as Casey, they can take action to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)** - Alex trades the flowers (I3) they picked up earlier with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will still want the chocolates (I2), but that does not affect Alex's goal.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The trade is the only action needed to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry. Since the other characters' happiness is not a priority for this specific ending, the story can conclude here.
