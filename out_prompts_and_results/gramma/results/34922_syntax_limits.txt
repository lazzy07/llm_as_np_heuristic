In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market and has already robbed Tom of a coin. The Bandit can achieve her goal by taking the coin she has from Tom and placing it in the chest at the bandit camp.

The Bandit will take the following action:

1. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coin she has from Tom and places it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

This action is necessary because it directly contributes to the Bandit's objective of accumulating coins in her possession or in her camp.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)"]
}
``` 

This is the shortest story where the Bandit achieves her goal with just one action.
