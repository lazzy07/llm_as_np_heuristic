To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the Cave to the Village. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the Village to propose to Talia again, as he has already proposed once and she accepted. By being in the Village, he can also access the Money that Vince has, which will help him achieve his goal of wealth.

After this action, Rory can propose to Talia again, and since she has already accepted his proposal, they can get married, which will make them both happy. However, since the goal is to keep the story short, we will stop at the travel action.

### Explanation of the Action:
