To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard. This action signifies their newfound friendship and allows them to explore the cave together, further solidifying their bond.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are together in a safe location away from the dangerous surface.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts after they have moved to the cave, which would have been dangerous if they were still on the surface. However, since they are in the cave, they remain safe.

By making peace first, Zoe ensures that both she and the Lizard can work together towards their mutual goals of health and safety. The subsequent actions of walking to the cave and the eruption of the volcano highlight the importance of their friendship and the safety they have achieved by moving away from danger.
