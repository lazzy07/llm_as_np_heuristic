To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market and needs to move towards the Crossroads to eventually reach the Cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom will continue on to the Cottage. This action is essential as it brings Tom directly to his desired location.

With these two actions, Tom successfully reaches the Cottage while carrying the medicine he purchased. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's goal, as they are focused on their own objectives.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom leaves the Market where he is currently located and heads towards the Crossroads. This is necessary for him to get closer to the Cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom arrives at the Crossroads and continues on to the Cottage. This final step is crucial for him to achieve his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) do not take any actions that would interfere with Tom's journey, allowing him to reach his destination without conflict.
