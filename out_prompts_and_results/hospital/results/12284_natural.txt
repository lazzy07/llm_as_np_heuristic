**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him immediately. Since Jones is in Patient Room A, Hathaway administers antibiotics to treat the Flaze disease. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Jones's symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now below 3, there is no risk of making a mistake. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that he is also experiencing a fever, indicating that he has Flaze as well. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, which successfully makes him healthy.

Finally, Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young. Upon assessment, Hathaway finds that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which successfully makes him healthy as well.
