To complete the story, Tom needs to return to the cottage while carrying the medicine. The following actions will help him achieve this goal:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.** (This action is necessary for Tom to reach the market where the merchant is located.)
2. **Tom gives the merchant the hero's coin to buy the medicine.** (Tom needs to acquire the medicine from the merchant, which he has already done.)
3. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.** (Tom needs to return to the crossroads to access the path back to the cottage.)
4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** (This final action allows Tom to reach his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.)

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- The first action is necessary for Tom to be in the right location to interact with the merchant.
- The second action is crucial as it allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires.
- The third action is required for Tom to transition back towards the cottage.
- The fourth action is the final step that brings Tom to his desired location with the medicine.
