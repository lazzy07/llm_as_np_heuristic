To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates, which are the only item in the dining room.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to have an item to trade or give to Alex.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and help them achieve their goal.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item, which may help in achieving their happiness.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I1). This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the right location to access the item that Alex wants.

6. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room. This is necessary because Blake needs to have the jewelry to give it to Alex.

7. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve their goal.

8. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.
