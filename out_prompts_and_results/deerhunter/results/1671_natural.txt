Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk, who has the money he desires.

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to intimidate the clerk and potentially steal the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal of obtaining money, but it allows Bubba to escape the scene after committing the theft.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted, and the story concludes with him having achieved his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the rifle**: This is crucial for Bubba to assert control over the situation and ensure he can take the money without resistance.
- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring 1 money.
- **Going to the forest**: While not necessary for the goal, it serves as a means for Bubba to escape after the theft.
