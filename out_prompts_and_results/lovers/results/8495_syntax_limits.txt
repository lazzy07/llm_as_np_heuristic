In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is I1 (flowers). The current situation shows that I1 is in the same room as Alex (R21). Therefore, the simplest action for Alex to achieve their goal is to pick up the flowers.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action makes Alex happy because they have obtained the item they wanted.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- at(C1) = R21; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R21; at(I1) = C1; at(I2) = R21; at(I3) = R22; happy(C1) = True; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = False; 

Now, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R21)"]
}
``` 

This action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness, as they have successfully obtained the item they desired.
