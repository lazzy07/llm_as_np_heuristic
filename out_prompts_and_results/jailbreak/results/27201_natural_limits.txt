**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Roy knows he has to act quickly to protect himself and Ernest. He quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen, ready to confront the bully. 

With a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, realizing too late what is happening, tries to fight back, but Roy is determined. In a desperate struggle, Roy manages to stab the bully, killing him instantly. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a rush of relief. He quickly checks the gym for any signs of guards before making his way back to the hallway. He knows he needs to escape before anyone finds out what happened. 

Once in the hallway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vent to the highway outside the prison. 

Finally, Roy steps out onto the highway, free from the prison and the threats that once loomed over him. He has achieved his goal of staying alive and escaping.
