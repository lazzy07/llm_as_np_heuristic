Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. She knows that she needs to make a connection with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take a proactive step.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to engage with the Lizard in a safe environment away from the volcano.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe reaffirms their friendship with the Lizard. This action solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to find a solution to the danger posed by the volcano.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, leaving the Lizard in the cave. This action is taken to ensure her own safety while trusting that the Lizard will remain safe in the cave.

By walking to the cave and making peace, Zoe ensures that the Lizard feels secure and valued, which aligns with both of their goals of being healthy and safe. The Lizard, now feeling a sense of friendship with Zoe, is more likely to remain safe in the cave, away from the erupting volcano.
