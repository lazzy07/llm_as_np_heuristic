To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, he is hungry, and since he has a rifle, he can hunt Bambi for food.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** (This action allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger.)
