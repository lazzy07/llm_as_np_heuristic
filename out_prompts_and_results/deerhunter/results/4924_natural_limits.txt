Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He goes from the bank to the forest where Bambi is. Bubba, with the rifle loaded, sees Bambi and decides to shoot. He successfully kills Bambi, satisfying his hunger. Afterward, he decides to eat Bambi, which gives him the sustenance he needs. However, he also realizes that he can take Bambi's body back to the bank to trade for money. 

In this story, Bubba's actions are focused on achieving his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger. The key actions are:

1. **Go from the bank to the forest**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, the deer he intends to hunt.
2. **Shoot and kill Bambi**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger by obtaining food.
3. **Decide to eat Bambi**: This action fulfills Bubba's immediate need for sustenance.

However, since Bubba's ultimate goal is to have money, he can also consider taking Bambi's body back to the bank to negotiate for money, but that is not necessary for the completion of the story as he has already satisfied his hunger.

The final plan is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go from the bank to the forest",
    "shoot and kill Bambi",
    "decide to eat Bambi"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of satisfying his hunger while also being in a position to consider future actions regarding money.
