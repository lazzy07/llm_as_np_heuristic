Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, stands in the bank with the clerk. He decides to take action to achieve his goal. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to intimidate the clerk and achieve his goal of getting money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, which is his goal.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any potential consequences of his actions and to find a place to eat.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully stolen the money he wanted and is now in the forest, where he can eat if he chooses to.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the ammunition**: This is crucial for Bubba to assert control over the situation and ensure he can steal the money without resistance.
- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Going to the forest**: This action allows Bubba to escape the bank after committing the theft, ensuring he is not caught.
