**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, stands on the highway, contemplating his next move. He knows that Roy is still in the cells, threatened by the bully, and he needs to ensure both of their safety.

1. **Ernest escapes from the prison.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free. Since he is already disguised, he can leave the prison without being recognized.

2. **Roy, still in the cells, decides to do his chores.**  
   - Although this action does not directly help him escape, it is necessary for Roy to avoid further threats from the bully and to maintain his safety while Ernest is outside.

3. **The bully, unaware of Ernest's escape, continues to believe he is in control.**  
   - This sets the stage for the next day, where the bully will still be focused on threatening Roy, allowing Ernest to remain safe outside.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's escape is the primary action that fulfills his goal of being alive and free. By putting on civilian clothes, he can blend in and avoid detection.
- Roy doing his chores is a defensive action to keep himself safe from the bully's threats, ensuring he remains alive until he can reunite with Ernest.
