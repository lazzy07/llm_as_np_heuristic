**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Roy is still in the cells, threatened by the bully's anger over the stolen cigarettes. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape once he confronts him.)
3. **Ernest enters the gym.** (This action allows Ernest to confront the bully directly.)
4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the critical action that allows Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both his and Roy's safety.)
5. **Ernest exits the gym and goes to the hallway.** (After dealing with the bully, Ernest needs to leave the gym.)
6. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows Ernest to escape the prison without being detected.)
7. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself.** (Although he is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise as he prepares to escape.)
8. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (This final action fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is strategically chosen to ensure that Ernest can eliminate the bully's threat and escape the prison. Locking the gym door prevents the bully from retaliating after being confronted, and killing the bully is essential for Ernest's survival. Crawling through the vents and escaping while disguised ensures that he can leave without being caught by the guards.
