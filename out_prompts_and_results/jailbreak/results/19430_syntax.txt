**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, Roy is on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that Ernest is in the gym and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to achieve his goal of escaping, Roy decides to take action.

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Roy locks the gym door from the hallway. This prevents the bully from accessing Ernest and gives them both a chance to regroup without the threat of the bully.

2. **next_day()**: The day transitions to day two. This is necessary to move the story forward and allow for new actions to be taken.

3. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Now that Roy is safely disguised and the gym is locked, he takes the opportunity to escape from the prison via the highway. This fulfills his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: This action is crucial as it protects Ernest from the bully, allowing him to remain safe while Roy makes his escape. It also prevents the bully from retaliating against either of them.
  
- **next_day()**: Transitioning to the next day is necessary to allow Roy to take the final action of escaping. It signifies the end of the first day and the beginning of new opportunities.
