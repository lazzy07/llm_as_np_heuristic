In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Casey achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) will trade the flowers (I1) they have with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3), making them happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I1), which is not what they want, but since Casey is happy, Blake's happiness is secondary to Casey's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: This action allows Casey to get the jewelry they want, achieving their goal of happiness.
