Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms. With a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she knows that she must act quickly to help the patients.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. She discovers that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. This action is necessary to identify Young's condition and provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics for Flaze. Since this matches Young's symptoms, Young becomes healthy. This action is crucial for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Jones. She finds that Jones has a rash, indicating Jarkis. This action is necessary to identify Jones's condition and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids for Jarkis. Since this matches Jones's symptoms, Jones becomes healthy. This final action ensures that both Young and Jones are now healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, ensuring their health and achieving her goal.
