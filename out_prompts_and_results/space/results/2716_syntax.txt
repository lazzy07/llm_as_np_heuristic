To complete the story, we will have Zoe teleport back to the surface, where the Lizard is located. Since the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and is currently in a dangerous situation, Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy and safe and to make friends. After making peace, the volcano will erupt, leading to the Lizard's demise, but they will have established a friendship before that happens.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe is currently on the ship and needs to teleport to the surface to interact with the Lizard.
2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface where the Lizard is located.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard, which is successful since they are not fighting.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's death.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the surface**: This is necessary for Zoe to interact with the Lizard, as she cannot make peace with him while she is on the ship.
- **Making peace**: This action is essential to fulfill both characters' desires to be friends and to ensure that they are not enemies before the eruption occurs.
- **Erupting the volcano**: This action fulfills the requirement of having a character die, which in this case is the Lizard, while also ensuring that the story ends with a significant event.
