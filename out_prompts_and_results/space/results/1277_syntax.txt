To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Given the current situation, the volcano is about to erupt, which poses a significant danger to both characters. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship, which will keep her safe, and then she can return to the surface to continue building her friendship with the Lizard.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the impending eruption. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe's goal is to be safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface. This action is important for her to continue her efforts to befriend the Lizard.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard can now make peace since they are both on the surface and not fighting. This action is crucial for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Teleporting to the ship** ensures Zoe's safety from the volcano eruption.
- **Teleporting back to the surface** allows Zoe to re-engage with the Lizard and continue their interaction.
- **Making peace** solidifies their friendship, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.
