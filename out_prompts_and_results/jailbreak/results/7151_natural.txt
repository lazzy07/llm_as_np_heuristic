**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is in the laundry room and that the bully is in the gym, but he also knows that both of them are threatened. 

1. **Roy moves from the highway to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to get closer to the gym where the bully is.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he cannot threaten either Roy or Ernest.)
3. **Roy sneaks back through the vent to the highway.** (This action allows Roy to return to safety while the bully is locked in the gym.)
4. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This action fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Sneaking back through the vent** keeps Roy safe while the bully is locked away, allowing him to avoid confrontation.
