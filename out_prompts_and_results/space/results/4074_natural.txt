Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety.

1. **Zoe walks with the Lizard to the cave.** This action is taken to move to a safer location away from the dangerous surface, where they can discuss their friendship and plans without the immediate threat of the volcano.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in a safe space helps to solidify their relationship and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to stay in the cave until the volcano stops erupting.** This action is implied as they choose to remain in a safe location, which allows them to avoid the dangers of the surface and focus on their friendship.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
