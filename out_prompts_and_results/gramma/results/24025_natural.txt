To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the market where she can interact with the hero and the guard.

2. **The merchant sells the medicine to the hero for 2 coins.**  
   - The merchant needs to sell the medicine to gain coins. The hero, who is at the market, is willing to buy the medicine, allowing the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

3. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is not directly related to the merchant's goal but helps maintain order in the market and ensures that the bandit does not pose a threat to the merchant's business.

4. **The guard walks to the crossroads to investigate the bandit’s location.**  
   - This action is necessary for the guard to follow up on the report and ensure the bandit is dealt with, which indirectly supports the merchant's goal by keeping the market safe.

5. **The hero walks back to the cottage carrying the medicine.**  
   - This action concludes the hero's involvement in the market, allowing the merchant to focus on her business without interference.

At the end of these actions, the merchant successfully sells the medicine and acquires 2 coins, achieving her goal without becoming a criminal.
