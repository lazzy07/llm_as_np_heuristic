In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) to be closer to Alex, who is currently in the dining room (R22) and has the jewelry (I1) with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the bathroom (R12). This action ensures that Alex receives the item they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After these actions, the happiness status will be:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex has I1)
- happy(C2) = False (Casey still does not have I2)
- happy(C3) = True (Blake is happy because Alex is happy)

This story is short and effective, as it only requires two actions to achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy.
