To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is included to ensure that Bubba is no longer in the bank after committing the theft, which is a logical move for someone who has just stolen money.

This sequence of actions results in Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
