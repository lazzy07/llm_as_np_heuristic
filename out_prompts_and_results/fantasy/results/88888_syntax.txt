To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she can acquire. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, she can marry him, which will make her happy. Additionally, she can also acquire money from Vince, which will contribute to her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, and they get married. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

2. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: After marrying Vince, Talia can take the money that Vince has. This action increases her wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action is necessary because Talia wants to be happy, and marrying Vince, who has proposed to her, will fulfill that desire.
   
2. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she can take the money that Vince possesses after their marriage.

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goals of happiness and wealth.
