To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Jones's health depends on identifying whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room A**: Young will walk from Admissions to Exam Room A. This action is not directly related to Jones's goal but is necessary to set up the next steps for Young's treatment.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is important for Young's health and to ensure that all patients are being treated.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are healthy, which aligns with Hathaway's goal.
