To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** (Rory needs to leave the cave to be with Talia and Vince, who are at the village.)
2. **Rory picks up the money from Vince.** (Rory needs to acquire wealth, and since Vince has the money, Rory will take it.)
3. **Rory proposes to Talia.** (Rory wants to be happy, and proposing to Talia will help achieve that.)
4. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** (This action is necessary for Rory's happiness.)
5. **Rory and Talia get married.** (This finalizes the proposal and ensures Rory's happiness.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Traveling to the village** is essential for Rory to be with Talia and Vince, as they are currently separated.
- **Picking up the money** is crucial for Rory to achieve their goal of being wealthy.
- **Proposing to Talia** is a direct action towards achieving happiness, as marriage is a significant source of happiness for Rory.
- **Talia accepting the proposal** is necessary for the marriage to happen, which is a step towards Rory's happiness.
- **Getting married** finalizes the relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness is achieved.
