To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is essential because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is vital for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, he will not make a mistake in diagnosing Ross.
