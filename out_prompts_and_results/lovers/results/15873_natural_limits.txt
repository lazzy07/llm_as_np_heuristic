In the living room, Alex sees the flowers that Casey had given them earlier. Since Alex wants to be happy and their goal is to have the flowers, they decide to pick them up. 

**Action:**
- Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to be happy by obtaining the flowers. Since the flowers are already in the living room, Alex can easily pick them up without needing to move to another room or involve other characters.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey remains happy because they have the jewelry.
