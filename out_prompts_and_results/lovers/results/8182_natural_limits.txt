In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex, who currently has the jewelry, wants the flowers. Blake wants the chocolates, which are in the dining room, and Casey wants the jewelry that Alex has. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to give the jewelry to Casey. This action will make Casey happy, and in turn, Alex can then pick up the flowers that are in the living room, achieving their own happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Alex gives the jewelry to Casey. (This makes Casey happy because they now have the jewelry they wanted.)
2. Alex picks up the flowers in the living room. (This makes Alex happy because they now have the flowers they wanted.)

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has the flowers, Casey has the jewelry, and Blake can still pursue the chocolates later.

- **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey**: This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness, which indirectly helps Alex by allowing them to pick up the flowers.
