To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also alive in the forest, and Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:
