To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is necessary for Alex to be with the other characters after obtaining the flowers.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is important because it makes Casey happy, which aligns with Alex's goal of wanting Casey to be happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to check for the chocolates. This action is necessary for Blake to pursue their own happiness.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This is essential for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary for Blake to be with the other characters after obtaining the chocolates.

8. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex. This action makes Alex happy, fulfilling their goal.

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has the flowers, Blake has the chocolates, and Casey has the jewelry.
