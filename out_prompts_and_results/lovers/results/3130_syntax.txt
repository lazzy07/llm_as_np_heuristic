To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to provide Alex with an item, which may help in the next step.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I1). This is necessary for Blake to obtain the item that Alex wants.

4. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Blake to have the item that Alex desires.

5. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to give the jewelry to Alex.

6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which means Alex is happy. 

Here’s the explanation of why each action is included:
- The first action is to bring Casey to Alex so that they can interact.
- The second action allows Casey to give Alex an item, which may help in the overall goal.
- The third and fourth actions are necessary for Blake to obtain the jewelry that Alex wants.
- The fifth action brings Blake back to Alex, allowing for the final exchange.
- The last action is the key to making Alex happy by giving them the jewelry they desire.
