To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero**: The bandit uses her sword to rob the hero, taking the hero's coin. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly, which is one of her goals.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp**: After robbing the hero, the bandit will walk back to her camp. This action is essential for the bandit to secure her coins in a safe location (the chest at the bandit camp) and to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **The bandit places the coins in the chest**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit will place the coins she has taken into the chest. This action is crucial as it ensures that the coins are secured and counts towards her goal of having coins in the chest.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Robbing the hero**: Increases the bandit's coin count, directly contributing to her goal.
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: Moves the bandit to a secure location where she can store her coins.
- **Placing coins in the chest**: Finalizes the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.
