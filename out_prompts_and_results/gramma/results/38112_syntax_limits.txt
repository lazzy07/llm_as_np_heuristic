To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the Cottage, and the only way to get there from the Crossroads is to walk.

This single action allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine he wants to carry. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]

This plan is efficient and directly leads to Tom achieving his goal with the minimum number of actions.
