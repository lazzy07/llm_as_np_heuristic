To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can choose to go to the forest, where Bambi is located. This action is optional for the goal but could lead to Bambi's fate.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: If Bubba decides to shoot Bambi, he can do so in the forest. This action would ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

However, since the goal is already achieved with Bubba having the money after the second action, the story can end there.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money, achieving the primary goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is optional but could lead to further consequences for Bambi.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action would ensure Bambi's death, fulfilling the secondary goal.
