**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room C, assesses Jones. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown symptoms, and Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. However, Dr. Hathaway believes Jones is alive and treats him with antibiotics, thinking he might have Flaze. Unfortunately, this is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross. Ross is still in Admissions, and Dr. Hathaway assesses him. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms, and with a workload of 3, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross dies as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Young. Young is still in Admissions, and Dr. Hathaway assesses him. Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms, and with a workload of 3, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young dies too.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for the patients, Dr. Hathaway's goal of treating all patients is achieved, albeit with tragic results.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Assess Jones**: Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide treatment. However, due to the high workload, a mistake is made.
2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This action is taken based on the assumption that Jones has Flaze, which is incorrect, leading to Jones's death.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway needs to see Ross next, so walking to Admissions is necessary.
4. **Assess Ross**: Similar to Jones, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms.
5. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Again, this is based on the assumption that Ross has Flaze, which is incorrect, leading to Ross's death.
6. **Return to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young next, so returning to Admissions is necessary.
7. **Assess Young**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms.
8. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: This is based on the assumption that Young has Flaze, which is incorrect, leading to Young's death.
