To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Blake and Casey are located (R22) to interact with them and potentially get the flowers.
   
2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) that are in the same room (R22) where they just moved. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Alex obtaining the item they want.

3. **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I3) they received earlier from Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear their hands for the flowers.

4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12) to ensure they are in a safe space with the flowers.

5. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3) to make them happy, which is also part of Alex's goal of wanting Casey to be happy.

6. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bedroom (R12) to check on Alex and Casey.

7. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex, which is what Alex wants, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers and the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
