Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she looks at the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both are aware of the dangers surrounding them, but Zoe is determined to make a friend. Since they are not fighting, she decides to take a step towards building a friendship.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is chosen because Zoe's goal is to make friends with the Lizard, and since they are already in a non-fighting state, this action will solidify their relationship. By making peace, Zoe ensures that both she and the Lizard can feel safe and healthy together, achieving her goal of friendship.

After this action, Zoe and the Lizard share a moment of understanding, realizing that they both want the same things: safety and companionship. They agree to work together to explore the planet and protect each other.
