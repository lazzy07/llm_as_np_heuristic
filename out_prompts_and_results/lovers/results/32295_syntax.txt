To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R22) to facilitate interaction.
2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
