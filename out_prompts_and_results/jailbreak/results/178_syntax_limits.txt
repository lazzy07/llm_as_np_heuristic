**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened because he has stolen the bully's pack of cigarettes. To ensure his safety and to escape the prison, Roy decides to take action. 

First, Roy locks the gym door from the hallway. This prevents the bully from coming after him and gives him a moment to think. With the gym locked, Roy feels a sense of relief, but he knows he needs to act quickly. 

Next, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will allow him to blend in and escape the prison without being recognized. 

Finally, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he is on the highway, he successfully escapes, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

3. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: Crawling through the vents to the highway is the final step in Roy's escape plan. It allows him to leave the prison without being caught.
