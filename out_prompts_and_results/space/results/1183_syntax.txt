To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial as it sets the foundation for cooperation and mutual safety.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface of the planet can start erupting at any time. By initiating this action, it creates a sense of urgency for both characters to find safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the impending eruption. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her own safety and to help the Lizard.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe to the cave. This action is essential for the Lizard to also find safety from the eruption.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action ensures that the danger of the eruption does not affect either character.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe, while also solidifying their friendship.
