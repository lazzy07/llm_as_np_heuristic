To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface, where the volcano is located. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard to the same location as the volcano, which is about to erupt.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement for the volcano to erupt, leading to a character's demise.

3. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard, now on the surface, attacks Zoe, resulting in her death. This action ensures that one character dies as a result of the eruption.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: After Zoe's death, the Lizard reflects on the situation and realizes that they could have been friends. This action symbolizes the Lizard's desire for friendship, even though Zoe is no longer alive to reciprocate.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard's realization of the importance of friendship, thus achieving the story's goals.
