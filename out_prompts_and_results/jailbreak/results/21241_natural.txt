**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realizes he needs to act quickly to protect both himself and Ernest. He knows that the bully is a threat and that he must find a way to escape or neutralize the danger.

1. **Roy waits in the gym.** (He needs to assess the situation and wait for the right moment to act.)
2. **Roy uses the knife to kill the bully.** (This action is necessary to eliminate the threat to both himself and Ernest. The knife is in the kitchen, but since Roy is already in the gym, he must have found a way to access it before locking the door.)
3. **Roy unlocks the gym door.** (After killing the bully, he needs to escape the gym.)
4. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This allows him to access the next steps toward his goal.)
5. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This is a stealthy way to escape the prison without being detected.)
6. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, making it easier to escape.)
7. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise on the highway, he successfully leaves the prison.)
