Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to leave the cave and head back to the spaceship for safety. However, as they walk to the surface, the volcano erupts violently, and Zoe is caught in the eruption.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface:** This action is necessary to move towards safety, but it ultimately leads to the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

The story ends with Zoe dying due to the eruption, while the Lizard remains safe in the cave, having made a friend in Zoe.
