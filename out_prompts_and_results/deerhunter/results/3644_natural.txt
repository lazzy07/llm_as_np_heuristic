To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the forest with a loaded rifle. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal the money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, which will eliminate the threat and allow him to take the money without resistance.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be in the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
- **Shooting the clerk** is necessary for Bubba to eliminate any opposition and secure the money without any risk of being stopped.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
