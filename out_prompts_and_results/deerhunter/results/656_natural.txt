Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. The clerk has the money that Bubba desires. To achieve his goal, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to intimidate the clerk and force him to give up the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank to avoid any potential consequences and to find a place to eat.

4. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - Since Bubba is hungry, he will decide to eat, fulfilling his need for sustenance.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money while also addressing his hunger.
