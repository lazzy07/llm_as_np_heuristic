In the current situation, Rory is in the Cave with Talia, who is now married to him. Vince is in the Village with the Money, which he has but does not care about since he does not want to be wealthy. Gargax, the dragon, is also in the Cave but does not have any items. 

To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the best action is for Rory to take the Treasure from the Cave. This action will make Rory wealthy, as he will now possess the Treasure, fulfilling his goal of wealth.

Hereâ€™s the story:

1. **take(Rory, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Rory takes the Treasure from Gargax in the Cave. This action is necessary because it allows Rory to become wealthy, which is one of his goals. 

After this action, Rory will be wealthy, and since he is already married to Talia, he will also be happy. 

Final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["take(Rory, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Rory achieves his goal with the minimum number of actions.
