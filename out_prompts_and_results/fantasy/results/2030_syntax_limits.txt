In the village, Rory and Talia are newly married. Rory wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Talia, being married to Rory, is also happy. However, they currently have no money or treasure. Vince, who is dead, has some money, which Rory can use to achieve his goal of wealth. Gargax, the dragon, is also in the village and is hungry.
