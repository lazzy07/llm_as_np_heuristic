To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom and the Bandit.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk from the Market to the Crossroads, where she can potentially interact with Tom and the Merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of his coin since Tom is not armed with a sword. This action allows the Bandit to acquire more coins, which is part of her goal.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Camp to store her newly acquired coin in the chest.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to continue her business and potentially sell more items.

6. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the Medicine from the Merchant using the coins she has, thus achieving her goal of acquiring more coins without becoming a criminal.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant maximizes her coins while avoiding any criminal activity. The Bandit, while achieving her own goal of acquiring coins, does not interfere with the Merchant's ability to conduct her business.
