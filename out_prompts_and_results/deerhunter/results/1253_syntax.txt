To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest. He needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the Clerk and take the money without resistance.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After dealing with the Clerk, Bubba can return to the Forest and eat Bambi. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money from the Clerk and that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
