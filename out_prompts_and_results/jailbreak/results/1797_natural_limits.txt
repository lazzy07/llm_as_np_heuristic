**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action. He sneaks through the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently engaged in his recreation time. With the knife hidden in his pocket, Ernest locks the gym door behind him, ensuring they are alone. He confronts the bully, who is taken by surprise. In a swift motion, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Roy.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole earlier. He then makes his way back through the hallway and crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself and successfully escapes from the prison.
