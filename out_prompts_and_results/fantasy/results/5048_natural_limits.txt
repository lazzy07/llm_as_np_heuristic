In the cave, Talia and Vince are together. Vince, wanting to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry, decides to take action. He picks up the treasure that is located in the cave. This action is crucial because it directly contributes to Vince's goal of becoming wealthy. 

Next, Vince travels from the cave to the village, where Gargax is located. Gargax, who is also at the village, is hungry and desires wealth. Vince, now with the treasure, can negotiate or trade with Gargax to ensure both of their needs are met. However, since the goal is for Vince to achieve his wealth, he simply needs to ensure he has the treasure in his possession.

With these two actions, Vince successfully achieves his goal of being wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Pick up the treasure**: This action is necessary for Vince to achieve his goal of wealth.
2. **Travel from the cave to the village**: This action allows Vince to move to a location where he can potentially interact with Gargax or secure his wealth.
