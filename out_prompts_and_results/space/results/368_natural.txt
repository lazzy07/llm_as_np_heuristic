Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially help the Lizard. She knows that the Lizard is at risk and that they need to establish a relationship to survive the eruption.

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** (Zoe wants to help the Lizard and assess the situation on the surface.)
2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** (Zoe wants to approach the Lizard to communicate and potentially make peace.)
3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (Zoe and the Lizard both want to be friends and realize they can help each other.)
4. **The volcano erupts.** (This is a natural event that occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, leading to a critical moment.)

In this sequence, Zoe's actions are focused on establishing a friendship with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy. The eruption serves as a climax that tests their newfound friendship.

However, since the volcano erupts after they make peace, it leads to a tragic ending where one character dies. In this case, we can assume that Zoe, having just arrived on the surface, is caught in the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the surface**: Zoe needs to be on the surface to help the Lizard and assess the danger.
- **Walking towards the Lizard**: This action is necessary for Zoe to initiate communication and show her intent to befriend the Lizard.
- **Making peace**: This is the key action that aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be friends and safe.
- **Volcano erupts**: This is the final event that concludes the story, resulting in Zoe's death, which adds a layer of tragedy to their friendship.
