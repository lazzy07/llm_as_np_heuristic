To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the treasure in the cave. The goal is to have Talia marry either Rory or Vince, as marriage will make her happy. Since both Rory and Vince have proposed to her, she can accept one of their proposals. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels to the Village to be closer to Talia, as he has proposed to her and wants to marry her.
2. **accept(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which makes her happy.
3. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married, solidifying their relationship and ensuring Talia's happiness.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary because Vince needs to be in the same location as Talia to propose marriage and for the marriage to take place. 
2. **accept(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepting Vince's proposal is crucial for her happiness. Since she has already been proposed to by both Rory and Vince, she needs to choose one to ensure her happiness.
3. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action finalizes their relationship and guarantees Talia's happiness, fulfilling her goal.

With these actions, Talia will achieve her goal of happiness through marriage.
