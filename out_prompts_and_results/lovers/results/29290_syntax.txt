To ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure that Casey also becomes happy, as Alex wants Casey to be happy. The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room to the living room where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially receive the item they want.

2. **give(C1, I2, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This is crucial because Casey wants the chocolates to be happy, and by giving them, Alex ensures Casey's happiness.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Blake involved.

4. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I3) to Alex. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps Blake achieve their own happiness, which is also a part of the interconnected goals.

5. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room. This action allows Alex to be in the same room as Blake and to potentially interact with them further.

6. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry (I1) in the dining room. This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but serves to show that Alex is content with the current situation.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have given Casey the chocolates, making Casey happy as well.
