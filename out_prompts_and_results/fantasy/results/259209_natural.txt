To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions to secure her wealth and happiness. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** (This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Rory, Gargax can potentially take the money that Rory has.)
2. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's dead body.** (This action allows Gargax to gain wealth, but it also means Rory is no longer a competitor for Talia's affections.)
3. **Talia proposes to Vince.** (Talia wants to be happy and wealthy. By proposing to Vince, she can solidify her relationship with him, which will contribute to her happiness.)
4. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.** (This action ensures that both Talia and Vince are happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.)
5. **Talia and Vince get married.** (This finalizes their relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness is solidified through marriage.)

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by having the treasure and the money that Gargax has taken from Rory).
