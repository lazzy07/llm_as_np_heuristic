Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the ground tremble beneath her as the volcano begins to erupt. She knows that both she and the Lizard are in danger. Remembering her goal of making friends, she approaches the Lizard, who is also on the surface, and suggests they work together to find safety.

Zoe takes the action to **make peace** with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it allows them to form a friendship, which is essential for their mutual safety.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can now work together to escape the danger posed by the erupting volcano, ensuring that both achieve their goals of health, safety, and friendship.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)"]
}
``` 

This single action effectively resolves the conflict and sets the stage for both characters to achieve their goals.
