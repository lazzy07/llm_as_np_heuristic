**Story Completion:**

As the tension in the gym escalates, Ernest and Roy realize they need to act quickly to ensure their survival. 

1. **Ernest decides to sneak out of the gym and crawl through the vents to the kitchen.** This action is necessary because the kitchen is where the knife is located, which they need to defend themselves against the bully.

2. **Once in the kitchen, Ernest steals the knife.** This is crucial for Ernest to have a means of protection against the bully, who has threatened both him and Roy.

3. **Ernest then crawls back through the vents to the gym.** This action allows him to return to Roy and confront the bully with the knife.

4. **In the gym, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully.** This is the final and necessary action to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Roy can survive.

5. **With the bully dead, Ernest and Roy can now safely escape the gym.** They can then make their way to the hallway and eventually to the highway.

6. **Once on the highway, they can put on the civilian clothes they had previously stolen.** This disguises them and allows them to escape from the prison.
