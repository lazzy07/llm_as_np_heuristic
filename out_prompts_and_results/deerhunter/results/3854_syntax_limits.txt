Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action. He knows he needs money to satisfy his greed, and he believes the bank clerk has some. Since he is already in the forest, he goes back to the bank where the clerk is located. Once there, he decides to steal the money from the clerk using his loaded rifle.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money he desires.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the clerk and steals the money.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where the money is, and the second action directly fulfills his greed by acquiring the money from the clerk.
