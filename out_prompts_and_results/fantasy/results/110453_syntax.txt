To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure located in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her primary goals.

2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia marries Rory in the cave. Since Rory has accepted Talia's proposal, this action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's goal but helps to establish a narrative closure by returning to the village.

4. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia also travels back to the village. This action is similar to Rory's and helps to conclude the story in a familiar setting.

5. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village as well. This action helps to wrap up the story by having all characters return to the village.

By performing these actions, Talia successfully achieves her goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).
