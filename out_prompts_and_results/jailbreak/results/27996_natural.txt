**Story Completion:**

Ernest, knowing he is threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his escape. He puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection while he plans his next move.

Next, Ernest sneaks back through the vent to the laundry room. This is necessary because he needs to reunite with Roy and inform him of the situation, as they are both threatened by the bully.

Once in the laundry room, Ernest finds Roy and quickly explains the situation. They both realize they need to act fast. Ernest hands the knife to Roy, who is still in the laundry room and can use it to defend themselves if the bully comes after them.

With the knife in Roy's possession, they both decide to head to the hallway. They know the bully is in the gym, and they need to lock the gym door to prevent him from coming after them. 

Ernest locks the gym door from the hallway, ensuring the bully is trapped inside. This action is vital as it eliminates the immediate threat from the bully.

Finally, with the gym door locked and the bully unable to reach them, Ernest and Roy can safely make their way to the highway. Once there, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise.
