**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, while Roy is in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes. Roy knows that the bully is in the gym, and he has locked the gym door to keep the bully contained. 

Roy decides to take advantage of the situation. He crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he finds the bully. Since the gym door is locked, the bully cannot escape. Roy has a knife in the kitchen, but he needs to get it first. 

Roy quickly crawls back through the vents to the kitchen, retrieves the knife, and returns to the gym through the vents again. Now, with the knife in hand and the bully trapped, Roy takes revenge by killing the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now safely escape. He crawls back to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself, and then heads to the highway. Once on the highway, he successfully escapes from the prison.
