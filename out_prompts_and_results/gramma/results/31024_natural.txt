**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, armed with two swords, decides to rob the hero at the crossroads. She successfully takes the medicine from the hero, who is unarmed and unable to defend himself. 
   - **Explanation:** This action allows the bandit to acquire an item of value, which she can later use to negotiate or trade for coins.

2. The bandit then walks to the market, where the merchant is located. 
   - **Explanation:** The bandit aims to sell the medicine to the merchant for coins, which aligns with the merchant's goal of acquiring coins.

3. At the market, the bandit sells the medicine to the merchant for two coins. 
   - **Explanation:** This action directly benefits the merchant, as she now has more coins, fulfilling her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal.

4. The bandit, now with two coins, walks back to the bandit camp to store her coins in the chest. 
   - **Explanation:** This action allows the bandit to secure her coins, ensuring she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

**Final Explanation:**
The story is structured to ensure that the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. The banditâ€™s actions, while criminal, ultimately facilitate the merchant's goal by providing her with the medicine she desires in exchange for coins. The hero, while losing the medicine, does not interfere with the merchant's goal, and the guard remains unaware of the transactions.
