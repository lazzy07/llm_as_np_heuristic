In this story, we will have the volcano erupt, leading to a character's death, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends. 

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface of the planet begins to erupt. This action is necessary to create a sense of danger and urgency in the story, setting the stage for the impending disaster.

2. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe decides to walk from the spaceship to the surface, despite the danger. This action is taken to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, allowing for the potential of making peace.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, now both on the surface, take a moment to communicate and understand each other, leading to a friendship. This action is crucial as it fulfills their mutual goal of making friends.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the death of Zoe. This action concludes the story with a dramatic event that fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the Lizard and Zoe become friends before the eruption.
