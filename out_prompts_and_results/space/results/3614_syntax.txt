To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and the safety of the Lizard while also fostering a friendship with the alien creature. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety and then return to the surface to continue building a friendship with the Lizard.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe's goal is to be safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface. This action is important to continue her efforts to befriend the Lizard.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters are no longer in conflict, which is essential for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
