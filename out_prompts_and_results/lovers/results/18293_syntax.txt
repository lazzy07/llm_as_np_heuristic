To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C2) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what they want, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this trade is sufficient.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want in exchange for the chocolates they have. This is the only action needed to ensure Alex's happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
