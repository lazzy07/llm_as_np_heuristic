To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates, which are currently in the dining room.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to have the item they want to potentially trade or give away.

3. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

4. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the flowers (I1) with Alex. This is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey is willing to give them up for the chocolates.

5. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Blake. This is necessary because Blake wants the flowers, and by giving them to Blake, Alex can ensure that Blake is happy.

6. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) back to Alex. This is necessary because Alex wants to ensure that they have the item they desire, which is the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
