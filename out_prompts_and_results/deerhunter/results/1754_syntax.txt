To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and wants to go to the Bank where the Clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the Clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the Clerk, who has the money, and to ensure that Bubba can take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can return to the Forest with the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the scene with the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to confront the Clerk to get the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the Clerk to take the money without opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money from the Bank after shooting the Clerk.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the Bank with the money, concluding the story.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
