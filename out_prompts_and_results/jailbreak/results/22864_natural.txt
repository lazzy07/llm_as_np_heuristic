**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing he is in a vulnerable position on the highway, decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will help him avoid detection by the guards and the bully. After putting on the clothes, he feels more secure and confident about escaping.

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the laundry room, knows that the bully is angry and looking for revenge. He decides to sneak through the vent to the hallway, where he can assess the situation and potentially help Ernest.

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door to ensure the bully remains trapped inside. This action protects both him and Ernest from the bully's threats.
