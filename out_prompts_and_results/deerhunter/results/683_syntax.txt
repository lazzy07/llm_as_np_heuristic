To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he is hungry. He also has a desire for money, which he knows the bank clerk possesses. Bambi is also in the forest, and since Bubba is hungry, he may consider eating Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either threaten the bank clerk or to hunt Bambi.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi. This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and Bambi is a potential source of food. By shooting Bambi, he can satisfy his hunger.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats Bambi. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and allows him to consume the animal he has just killed.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the rifle. This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi and has also stolen the money from the bank clerk.
