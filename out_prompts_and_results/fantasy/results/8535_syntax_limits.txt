To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her marrying Rory, which will make her happy, or acquiring the treasure, which will make her wealthy. Since Talia has already proposed to Rory, the next logical step is for Rory to accept the proposal, leading to their marriage.

1. **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory accepts Talia's marriage proposal. This action makes both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.
2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

At this point, Talia is happy due to her marriage to Rory. Since the goal is to make Talia happy or wealthy, this outcome is satisfactory.

The actions are necessary because:
- Accepting the proposal is a prerequisite for marriage, which is essential for Talia's happiness.
- Marrying Talia and Rory directly results in Talia achieving her goal of happiness.
