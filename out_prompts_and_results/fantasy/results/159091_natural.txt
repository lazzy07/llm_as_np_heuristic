To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to obtain the treasure located in the cave. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Gargax is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. By eating Vince, Gargax also eliminates a potential obstacle to obtaining the treasure, as Vince is currently the only character with the money and is at the village.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure.** - After eating Vince, Gargax can now take the treasure that is located in the cave. This action fulfills Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by taking the treasure) and is no longer hungry (having eaten Vince).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince:** This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, the act of eating Vince serves a dual purpose: it alleviates Gargax's hunger and removes a character who could potentially interfere with Gargax's plans.
  
- **Gargax takes the treasure:** This action is essential for Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth. The treasure is the only item that can make Gargax wealthy, and since Gargax is already in the cave where the treasure is located, this action directly leads to fulfilling Gargax's objective.
