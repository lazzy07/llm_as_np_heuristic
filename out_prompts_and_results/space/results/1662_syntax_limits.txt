In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is on the surface of the planet. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe, wanting to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard, decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to interact with the Lizard and address the dangerous situation caused by the volcano. By being on the surface, she can attempt to communicate and build a relationship with the Lizard.

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, which is essential for establishing a connection and potentially making peace.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is crucial as it allows both characters to become friends. By making peace, they can work together to ensure their safety and health, aligning with both of their goals.

4. **The volcano erupts**: This event occurs as a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can face the eruption together, but the eruption ultimately leads to the death of one character.

In this scenario, the story ends with the volcano erupting, and while Zoe and the Lizard become friends, the eruption results in the death of the Lizard, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
