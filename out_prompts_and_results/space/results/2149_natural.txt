To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will result in a character dying. Since Zoe and the Lizard are already friends, we can focus on the actions that will lead to the volcano erupting and ultimately result in one of the characters dying.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because it places Zoe in a dangerous situation on the surface where the volcano can erupt.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.**  
   - This event is triggered by the narrative and leads to the danger that will ultimately result in a character dying.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This action concludes the story with Zoe dying as a result of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - This action is included to show that the Lizard is aware of the eruption and is moving towards the danger, but it is too late to save Zoe.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe (in spirit).**  
   - This action symbolizes the Lizard's acceptance of Zoe's fate and reinforces their friendship, even though Zoe is no longer alive.

The final story sequence leads to the eruption of the volcano, Zoe's death, and the Lizard's acknowledgment of their friendship, even in the face of tragedy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.",
    "The volcano on the surface erupts.",
    "Zoe is killed by the eruption.",
    "The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.",
    "The Lizard makes peace with Zoe."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcomes while adhering to the constraints of the story.
