Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Given Hathaway's workload of 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. However, since Jones is the only patient in Room B, Hathaway decides to treat Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis due to the unknown symptoms. 

After administering the treatment, Jones becomes healthy, as the treatment aligns with the unknown symptoms he is experiencing. This success reduces Hathaway's workload to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young, who is still waiting there. This action does not change Young's location but prepares Hathaway to assess and treat Young in the future.

In this short story, the actions taken are necessary to ensure that at least one patient becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
