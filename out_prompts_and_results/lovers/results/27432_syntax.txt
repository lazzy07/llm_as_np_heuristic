To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) can trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Alex (C1) wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to get the item they desire, which will make them happy.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy since they helped Alex.
- Casey will still have the flowers (I3) and will remain happy.

This single action is sufficient to ensure Alex's happiness.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: This action allows Blake to give Alex the jewelry they want in exchange for the chocolates. Since both characters want to make each other happy, this trade is beneficial for both.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:
