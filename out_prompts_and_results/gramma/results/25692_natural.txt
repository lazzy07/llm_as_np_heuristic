To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit is looking to find the hero or the merchant to rob them of their coins. This action is necessary as it brings the bandit closer to the crossroads where the hero and merchant are.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the merchant who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, which is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

3. **The bandit walks back to the bandit camp.**  
   - After robbing the merchant, the bandit returns to the safety of the bandit camp with the stolen coin.

4. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant, realizing she has lost the coin, moves to the crossroads to potentially find the hero or the guard to report the bandit.

5. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard, having been alerted by the merchant about the bandit, moves to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

6. **The guard reports the location of the bandit.**  
   - The guard successfully reports the bandit's location, which is essential for the merchant to feel safe and continue her business without fear of being robbed again.

7. **The guard walks to the bandit camp.**  
   - The guard goes to the bandit camp to confront the bandit, ensuring that the bandit is dealt with and that the merchant can operate freely.

8. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the threat posed by the bandit, allowing the merchant to feel secure in her dealings.

9. **The merchant loots the bandit's corpse.**  
   - The merchant takes the coin that was stolen from her, thus achieving her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.
