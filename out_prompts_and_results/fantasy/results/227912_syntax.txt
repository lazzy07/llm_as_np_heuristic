To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions that lead to acquiring the treasure and maintaining her happiness. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure in the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can provide her with wealth.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to return to the village to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and solidify her happiness.

3. **Talia gives the treasure to Rory.**  
   - By giving the treasure to Rory, Talia ensures that Rory is happy, which in turn keeps her own happiness intact since they are married.

4. **Talia picks up the money from Vince.**  
   - This action allows Talia to gain some wealth, as she now has the money that Vince possesses.

5. **Talia becomes happy.**  
   - Since Talia is now wealthy (having the treasure) and has maintained her relationship with Rory, she achieves her goal of happiness.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. `pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)`
2. `travel(Talia, Cave, Village)`
3. `take(Rory, Treasure, Talia, Village)`
4. `pickup(Talia, Money, Vince)`
5. `get_hungry(Talia)`
