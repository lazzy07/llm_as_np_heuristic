To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for her to obtain the treasure, which will contribute to her wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and Vince.

4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. Since Rory has accepted her proposal, this action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- Talia needs to travel to the cave to access the treasure, which is essential for her wealth.
- Picking up the treasure is a direct action that increases her wealth.
- Returning to the village allows her to engage with Rory, who she has a relationship with.
- Marrying Rory fulfills Talia's desire for happiness, as she is now in a committed relationship.
