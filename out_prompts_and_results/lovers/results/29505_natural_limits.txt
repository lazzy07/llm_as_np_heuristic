In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered together. Alex, wanting the flowers, is feeling unhappy. Blake, who desires the chocolates, is also not happy, while Casey is content with the jewelry they received from Blake. 

To help Blake achieve their goal, Alex decides to take action. 

1. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.** This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have the flowers, which they want. However, since Alex believes that Blake wants the chocolates, this action indirectly helps Blake by creating a situation where Blake can focus on finding the chocolates.

2. **Alex puts down the flowers in the living room.** This action is crucial because it allows Blake to see the flowers and realize that they are not what he wants. It also keeps the flowers available for Alex to pick up again if needed.

3. **Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom.** This action is essential because Blake believes the chocolates are in the bathroom. By moving to the bathroom, Blake can search for the chocolates, which is his goal.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.** This action is the final step for Blake to achieve happiness, as he now has the item he desires.

In this sequence, Alex's actions create an opportunity for Blake to pursue his goal of obtaining the chocolates, leading to Blake's happiness.
