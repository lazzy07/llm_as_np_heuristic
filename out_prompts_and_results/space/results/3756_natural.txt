Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** This action is taken to seek shelter from the impending eruption of the volcano. The cave is a safer location compared to the surface, which is currently dangerous.

2. **The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave.** This action is necessary for the Lizard to stay safe and to maintain their friendship with Zoe. The Lizard wants to be healthy and safe, and following Zoe into the cave ensures that both characters can remain together and safe.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in a safe location strengthens their bond and ensures that they can work together to face any future challenges.

4. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have moved to the cave, ensuring that they are safe from the eruption. The eruption is a natural consequence of the story's setting, but it does not affect Zoe and the Lizard since they are in the cave.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
