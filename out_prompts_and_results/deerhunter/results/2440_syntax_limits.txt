After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action fulfills his need for food and allows him to take advantage of the situation. Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her without any repercussions. 

Next, Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the bank clerk. He is still greedy and wants to obtain the money from the clerk. Since he has just eaten, he is no longer hungry, and he can focus on his goal of getting the money.

The actions taken are as follows:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger and utilizing the dead animal for sustenance.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially take the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba is no longer hungry and positions him to achieve his goal of obtaining money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan is efficient and directly leads to Bubba's goals of satisfying his hunger and obtaining money.
