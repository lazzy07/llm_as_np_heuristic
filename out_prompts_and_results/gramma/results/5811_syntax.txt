To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying coins. This action allows the bandit to take the coins from Tom, increasing her total.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has the maximum amount of coins possible.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The bandit, already at the crossroads, sees Tom, who is carrying coins. The bandit decides to rob Tom, as he is unarmed and vulnerable. This action is successful, and the bandit takes Tom's coins.
- With the coins now in her possession, the bandit then walks to the bandit camp to take the coins stored in the chest. This action allows her to maximize her coin collection.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
