To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake, who are currently in the dining room with the jewelry.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry (I1)**: This action is a lie, as Alex actually wants the flowers (I2). However, this misinformation can lead Casey to believe that Alex is not interested in the jewelry, which may prompt them to take action.

3. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I1) from Alex**: Since Casey is now in the same room as Alex, they can pick up the jewelry that Alex is holding. This is the key action that allows Casey to achieve their goal.

4. **Casey moves back to the living room (R21)**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Casey's goal but can be included to signify that Casey is now happy with the jewelry.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to interact with them.
- **tell(C2, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake lies to Casey about Alex's desires, which may influence Casey's decision-making.
- **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: This is the crucial action where Casey acquires the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action signifies Casey's transition after achieving their goal.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "tell(C2, C3, I1, R22)",
    "pick_up(C3, I1, R22)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey ends up with the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
