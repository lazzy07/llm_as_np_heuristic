Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, and they need to act quickly.

1. **Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship** to assess the situation and find a way to help the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to ensure her own safety and gather resources or information that might help them both.

2. **The Lizard, realizing the danger of the eruption, decides to walk to the surface** to warn any other creatures that might be in danger. This action is important for the Lizard to fulfill its role as the guardian of the planet and to ensure the safety of others.

3. **As the volcano erupts, the Lizard is caught on the surface and is killed**. This action is a consequence of the previous actions and serves to fulfill the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

After these actions, Zoe, now back on the spaceship, reflects on her friendship with the Lizard and vows to honor its memory by continuing to protect the planet and its creatures.
