In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are currently not happy. Casey (C3) is happy because they have the chocolates (I3). Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I2) but does not have them, and they are also not happy.

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the jewelry (I1) that is in the same room (R22) where they currently are. This action will make Alex happy, as they will have the item they want.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room, which is in the same room (R22). This action fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:

- Alex (C1) is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy because they still do not have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the chocolates (I3).

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
