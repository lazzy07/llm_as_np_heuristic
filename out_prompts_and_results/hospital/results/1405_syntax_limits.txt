**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to Exam Room A and Ross to Exam Room C, Hathaway is busy with two patients. Jones, feeling anxious about his health, decides to walk to Exam Room A where he is assigned. 

Once in Exam Room A, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway is unsure but believes he is alive and healthy. 

Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, thinking that he might have Flaze, as it is the only disease that requires antibiotics. Fortunately, Jones does not have Flaze, but the treatment does not harm him, and he remains healthy.

Finally, Hathaway checks on Ross in Exam Room C, where he assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

In the end, both Jones and Ross are alive and healthy, achieving their goals.
