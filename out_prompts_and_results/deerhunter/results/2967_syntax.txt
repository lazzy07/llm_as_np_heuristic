1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money without resistance. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only one with money, and Bubba's greed drives him to eliminate the clerk to achieve his goal.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it allows Bubba to fulfill his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to remove the clerk as a threat and to gain access to the money.
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to collect the money after the clerk has been dealt with.
