In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in the hospital admissions room and has a workload of 3. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients assigned to the exam rooms. 

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room A to assess Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Jones is necessary to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway determines that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

By taking these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Jones, reducing their workload and moving closer to their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
