To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to happiness and wealth. Since he already has the money, he needs to find a way to become happy. The best way for Vince to achieve happiness is to marry Talia, as they have already established a relationship where Talia has accepted his proposal.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Vince's goal:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince marries Talia, which will make both of them happy. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Vince's goal of achieving happiness.

2. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: After getting married, Vince travels to the cave to find the treasure. This action is necessary for Vince to pursue wealth.

3. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential as it directly contributes to Vince's wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action makes Vince happy, fulfilling one of his primary goals.
- **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: This action allows Vince to access the treasure, which is necessary for him to become wealthy.
- **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: This action directly increases Vince's wealth, completing his goal.

With these actions, Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
