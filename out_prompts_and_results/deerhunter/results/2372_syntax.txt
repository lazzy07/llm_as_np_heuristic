To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a rifle, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also present and is greedy, which means he may be a target for Bubba's actions.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry and needs to eat. This action is necessary for him to satisfy his hunger.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Bank)**: Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's immediate need for food.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can focus on his greed and desire for money.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba can steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Bank)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to pursue money after eating.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the clerk, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide_to_eat(Bubba)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Bank)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and successfully obtains money, achieving his goals in the shortest possible way.
