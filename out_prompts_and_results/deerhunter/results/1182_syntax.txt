To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary because he needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot the bank clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and shooting the clerk will allow him to take it without resistance.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest after taking the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the scene.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi, the deer, in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to confront the clerk to get the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the clerk to take the money without opposition.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba takes the money from the dead clerk, achieving his goal of having money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank after committing the robbery.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba kills Bambi, ensuring that both conditions of the goal are met.
