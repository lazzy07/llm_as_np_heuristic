Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis, which is incorrect. However, she treats him for Jarkis, which is the wrong treatment, and Ross dies.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to see the other patients.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him for it. Young dies as well.

4. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones.

5. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. She mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Jones survives and becomes healthy.
