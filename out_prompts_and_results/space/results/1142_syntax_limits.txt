Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they share a mutual desire to be healthy and safe while also wanting to make friends. To achieve this, Zoe decides to take a proactive step.

**Action: teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**

By teleporting back to the spaceship, Zoe ensures her safety from the dangerous conditions on the surface. This action also allows her to prepare for future explorations and interactions with the Lizard and other creatures. The Lizard, seeing Zoe prioritize her safety, feels reassured and understands that they can continue to build their friendship in a safer environment.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The action of teleporting to the ship is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe and healthy. It also indirectly supports the Lizard's goal of making friends, as Zoe can return to the surface later with better resources and safety measures to interact with the Lizard and other creatures.
