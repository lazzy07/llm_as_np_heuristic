To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that Casey (C3) has the chocolates (I3) and is in the same room as Blake (C2). 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I2) that is there.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room (R21).
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and Alex are.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey (C3), which makes Casey happy since they want the jewelry.
5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to put down the chocolates (I3).
6. **put_down(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I3) in the dining room (R21).

8. **pick_up(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I3) from the living room (R22).
