Ernest, aware of the bully's threat, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the knife in the kitchen could be the key to dealing with the bully. 

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to get the knife to defend himself and Roy.)
2. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This gives him a means to confront the bully.)
3. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (He needs to confront the bully directly.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can deal with the threat.)
