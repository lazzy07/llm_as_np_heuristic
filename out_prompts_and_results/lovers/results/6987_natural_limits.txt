In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to tell Casey that Blake wants the flowers. 

**Action:**
1. Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the flowers.

**Explanation:**
- By telling Casey that Blake wants the flowers, Alex hopes to create a sense of urgency or motivation for Casey to give the flowers to Blake. Since Casey wants Blake to be happy, they might be inclined to give the flowers to Blake, which would then allow Alex to ask Blake for the flowers in return, achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Casey, believing that Blake wants the flowers, decides to give the flowers to Blake.
- Blake, now having the flowers, can then give them to Alex, making Alex happy.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness through this single action.
