To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, thus making it possible for Bubba to take the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now steal the money from the dead clerk. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

The story is short and direct, with only three actions needed to reach the desired outcome. The first action gets Bubba to the bank, the second action eliminates the clerk, and the third action allows Bubba to take the money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
