To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard continue to build their friendship while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a character's death. The goal is to create a scenario where they can become friends, but the eruption will ultimately lead to one of them dying.

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are already in a non-fighting state and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is necessary to ensure that they are friends before the volcano erupts.
   
2. **Erupt the volcano**: After they have made peace, the volcano will erupt, which is a critical event that leads to the death of one character. 

3. **Zoe dies**: Since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she will die as a result of the eruption.

The sequence of actions will ensure that the story ends with the volcano erupting, one character dying, and both characters having made peace.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: This action solidifies their friendship, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of making friends. They are in the same location and not fighting, so this is a logical step.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: This action triggers the volcano to erupt. Since Zoe is on the surface, she will be affected by the eruption, leading to her death. This fulfills the requirement of having a character die.

The final outcome is that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, but Zoe dies due to the eruption of the volcano.
