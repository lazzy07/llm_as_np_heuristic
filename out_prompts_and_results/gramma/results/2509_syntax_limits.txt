In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp with the Medicine, and the Bandit is at the Crossroads. The Bandit has a sword and is a criminal, which poses a threat to the Merchant. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit. This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be in the same location as the Bandit to potentially negotiate or take action regarding the coins.

At the Crossroads, the Merchant can then buy the Medicine from herself, effectively increasing her coin count without committing a crime. However, since the goal is to keep the story short and focused on the Merchant achieving her goal, we will stop here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant walking to the Crossroads allows her to be in a position to interact with the Bandit, who has coins. This is a strategic move to either negotiate or take advantage of the situation to acquire coins.
