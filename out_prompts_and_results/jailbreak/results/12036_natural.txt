**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs to retrieve it to defend himself and Roy.

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to get the knife to protect himself and Roy from the bully.)
2. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This gives him a means of defense against the bully.)
3. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (He knows the bully is there and wants to confront him.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that they can have a confrontation without interference.)
5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This eliminates the threat to both him and Roy.)

With the bully dead, Ernest can now ensure that he and Roy are safe. He can also retrieve the pack of cigarettes later, but for now, his primary goal of staying alive and not being threatened is achieved.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the kitchen is essential for Ernest to obtain the knife, which is crucial for his defense.

- Moving to the gym allows Ernest to confront the bully directly.
- Locking the gym door ensures that the bully cannot escape and that Ernest can handle the situation without fear of outside interference.
