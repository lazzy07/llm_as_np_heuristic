In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I3 (chocolates) to be happy, and they are in the same room as Casey (C3), who has I1 (flowers) and is also unhappy. Blake (C2) is in the same room but has I3 (chocolates) and is unhappy as well. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I3) they want from Blake for the flowers (I1) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is essential for their happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake will be happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey will still be unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, the story can conclude here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness. Since Alex wants I3 and Blake has it, trading allows Alex to fulfill their desire directly.
