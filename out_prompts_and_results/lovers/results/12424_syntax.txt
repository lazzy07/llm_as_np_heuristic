To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants the jewelry (I2), and Alex wants the flowers (I1). Since Alex is currently unhappy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the flowers, which will also make Blake happy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and the items in the living room.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is crucial because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the flowers (I1) by providing them with something valuable, which may lead to a positive interaction.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) to pick up the flowers (I1). This is necessary for Alex to fulfill their desire.

4. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to achieve happiness.

5. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to show Blake the flowers they have picked up. This action is important for Blake to see that Alex is now happy.

6. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the flowers (I1) in the living room (R22). This action allows Blake to see the flowers and confirms that Alex is happy.

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has the flowers, Blake has the jewelry, and Casey has the chocolates.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: This action directly helps Alex by giving them something valuable, which may lead to a positive outcome.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to move to get the flowers, which is their desired item.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This action is necessary for Alex to achieve happiness.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex returns to show Blake their happiness.
- **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: This confirms Alex's happiness to Blake.
