Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano could erupt at any moment. She has already made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, and they both want to be healthy and safe. To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and avoid the dangers of the surface.

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety by moving her to the spaceship, away from the dangerous surface where the volcano could erupt.

By teleporting to the ship, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe. She can also continue to communicate with the Lizard from the ship, fostering their friendship from a safe distance.
