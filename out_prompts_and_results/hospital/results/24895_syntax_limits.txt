In this story, we will ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy by having Hathaway assess and treat them correctly. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial as it directly impacts Jones's health.

Here’s the complete story:

Hathaway walks into PatientRoomC where Jones is located. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, fever, PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to identify Jones's symptoms, which is essential for determining the correct treatment.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to treat Jones for Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.
