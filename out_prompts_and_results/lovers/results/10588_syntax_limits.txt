In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, while Casey (C3) wants the jewelry (I3) and Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I2). Since Alex is currently unhappy and the flowers are in the same room (R22), the best action for Alex to take is to pick up the flowers.

**Story Completion:**
1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
- Casey and Blake remain unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, the story ends here.

**Explanation of the Action:**
- The action of picking up the flowers is necessary because it directly leads to Alex achieving their goal of happiness. Since the story only requires Alex to be happy, this single action suffices.
