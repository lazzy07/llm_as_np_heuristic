Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve a resolution, Zoe needs to establish a friendship with the Lizard while also ensuring that they are both safe from the erupting volcano.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to assess the situation on the surface and see the danger posed by the erupting volcano. It also creates a scenario where the Lizard can follow her, leading to a potential confrontation or resolution.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is crucial as it introduces immediate danger, forcing both characters to react. The eruption will create a sense of urgency and may lead to a change in their relationship dynamics.

3. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the surface, which is essential for them to confront the danger together. This action also brings them into the same location, allowing for the possibility of making peace.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action is taken to transform their relationship from enemies to friends. Given the imminent danger of the volcano, they realize that cooperation is necessary for survival.

5. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the volcano erupts. Since she has made peace with the Lizard, she can leave without hostility.

6. **The Lizard is killed by the eruption.** - This is the final outcome of the story, where the Lizard, despite their newfound friendship, is unable to escape the eruption in time.

The story concludes with Zoe safe on the spaceship, having made peace with the Lizard, who unfortunately dies due to the eruption. This ending highlights the themes of friendship and the unpredictability of danger.
