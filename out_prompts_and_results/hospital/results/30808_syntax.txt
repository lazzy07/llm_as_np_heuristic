To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to identify his symptoms. This is essential for determining the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will assume Hathaway correctly identifies the disease.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the identified symptoms. This action is vital for Jones to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
