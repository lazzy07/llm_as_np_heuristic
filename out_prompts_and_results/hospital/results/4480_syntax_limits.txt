**Story Completion:**

After assessing Jones in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by SymptomA (fever). To ensure Jones becomes healthy, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address the other patients. Since Young is in Exam Room B and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway decides to assess Young to determine his symptoms.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that he is showing symptoms of Jarkis (rash). 

Now that Hathaway knows Young's condition, he can proceed to treat him appropriately.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Young becomes healthy as a result.

At this point, Hathaway has successfully treated both Jones and Young, ensuring they are both healthy. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to treat Jones with antibiotics, which is necessary to ensure he recovers from Flaze.
- The second action is to assess Young to identify his symptoms, which is crucial for determining the correct treatment.
