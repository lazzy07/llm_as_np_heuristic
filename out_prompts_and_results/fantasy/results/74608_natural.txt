To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to increase his wealth, as the treasure is located at the cave.

2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to go to the village to secure his wealth and ensure he is not hungry, as the village is where Gargax is located.

3. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is crucial because Gargax, who is at the village, wants to eat a human. By eating Vince, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and since Vince is already married to Talia, this will not affect Talia's happiness.

4. **Vince takes the money from his own dead body.**  
   - After being eaten, Vince can take the money from his own body, which allows him to retain his wealth even in death.

5. **Vince's wealth is now 1 (from the money), and he is not hungry (as he is dead).**  
   - This final state ensures that Vince has achieved his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, even though he is no longer alive.

The story is structured to ensure that Vince's actions lead to the fulfillment of his goals, despite the unconventional outcome of his death.
