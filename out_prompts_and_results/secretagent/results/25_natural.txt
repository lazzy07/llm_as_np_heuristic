To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must take the following actions:

1. **The secret agent picks up the gun in the lobby.**  
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent needs the gun to kill the mastermind.

2. **The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office.**  
   - The office is a location where the secret agent can confront the mastermind. The mastermind is unaware of the secret agent's location, so this move is strategic.

3. **The secret agent kills the mastermind in the office.**  
   - This action fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is minimal and directly leads to the desired outcome. The secret agent first acquires the weapon, then moves to a location where the mastermind can be found, and finally executes the action to eliminate the mastermind.
