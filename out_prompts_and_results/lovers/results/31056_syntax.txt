To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room to be closer to Casey, who has the chocolates.
2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After these actions, Alex will be happy, and the story will conclude.
