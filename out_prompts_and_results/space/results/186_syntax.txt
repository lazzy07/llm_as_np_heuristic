Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. She has made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, and they both want to be healthy and safe while making friends. To achieve her goal, Zoe needs to ensure both she and the Lizard can escape the dangerous surface before the volcano erupts completely.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to further their friendship and discuss their next steps.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they are both committed to working together for their safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface to join Zoe. This action is important as it allows them to be together again and strategize their escape.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action is crucial for her safety, as the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship as well. This action ensures that both characters are safe from the eruption and can continue their friendship in a safe environment.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
