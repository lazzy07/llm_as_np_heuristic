To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Ross without reducing their workload. However, since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

2. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway needs to move him to Exam Room B, where he is assigned. This is necessary for Hathaway to treat Ross.

3. **Treat Ross**: Once Ross is in Exam Room B, Hathaway can treat him based on the symptoms assessed. If Ross has Jarkis (rash), he will be treated with steroids, which will make him healthy.

4. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway should assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

5. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway needs to move Young to Exam Room C for treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young based on the symptoms assessed. If Young has Flaze (fever), he will be treated with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
