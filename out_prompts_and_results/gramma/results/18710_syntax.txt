To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom will walk directly to the cottage, where he wants to be.

These actions are necessary because Tom's goal is to reach the cottage with the medicine he has purchased. The actions taken are the most direct route to achieve this goal without unnecessary conflict or complications.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom leaves the market, where he has just bought the medicine, and heads towards the crossroads. This is necessary to move towards his ultimate destination, the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom continues from the crossroads to the cottage. This final step brings him to his desired location with the medicine.

At this point, Tom is at the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.
