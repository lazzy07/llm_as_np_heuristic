In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are currently not happy. Casey (C3) has the flowers, but Alex believes that Casey wants the jewelry (I3). To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to trade with Casey.

**Action:**
- trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)

**Explanation:**
- Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey for the flowers (I1) that Casey currently has. This action is necessary because it directly allows Alex to obtain the item they want (flowers), thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this trade, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, and Casey will also be happy because they now have the jewelry.
