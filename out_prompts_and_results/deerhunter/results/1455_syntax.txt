To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the rifle and has already stolen it from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed level of 1, indicating he wants more money. The clerk is also greedy but has no money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is in the way of Bubba achieving his goal of getting money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat him to satisfy his hunger. This action is included because Bubba is hungry, and eating the clerk will fulfill that need.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to take the money from the clerk's body. This action is necessary to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the clerk. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and ensures he has achieved his goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger after committing the act.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's intention to take the money after the clerk is no longer a threat.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finalizes Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
