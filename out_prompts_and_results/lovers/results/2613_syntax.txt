To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the living room (R12) and has the chocolates (I3).

2. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex.

3. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex and Casey trade items. Alex gives chocolates (I3) to Casey, and in return, Casey gives Alex the flowers (I1). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want.

4. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R12) after the trade.

Now, Alex has the flowers (I1), which makes Alex happy. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first move brings Alex closer to Casey, who has the item Alex wants.
- The second move allows Casey to join Alex, facilitating the trade.
- The trade action is essential as it directly results in Alex obtaining the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- The final move is not necessary for Alex's happiness but shows Casey's action after the trade.
