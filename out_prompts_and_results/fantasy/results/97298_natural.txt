To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and Talia needs to interact with him to achieve her goal of wealth.

2. **Vince gives the money to Talia.**  
   - This action is essential for Talia to become wealthy. Since Talia is married to Vince, he can give her the money directly.

3. **Talia picks up the treasure from the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to increase her wealth further. The treasure is located in the cave, and since Talia is now wealthy, she can claim it.

4. **Talia's happiness increases to 1.**  
   - This action reflects Talia's emotional state after becoming wealthy, fulfilling her goal of happiness.

5. **Talia's wealth increases to 2 (1 from money + 1 from treasure).**  
   - This action reflects Talia's new financial status after acquiring both the money and the treasure.

By following these actions, Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy.
