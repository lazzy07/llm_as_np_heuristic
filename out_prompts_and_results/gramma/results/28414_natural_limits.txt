The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows the bandit is at the crossroads and that the guard is at the market. The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads, where she reports the banditâ€™s location to the guard. 

The guard, upon receiving this information, walks to the crossroads and attacks the bandit, killing her.

This action allows the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without engaging in criminal activity.
