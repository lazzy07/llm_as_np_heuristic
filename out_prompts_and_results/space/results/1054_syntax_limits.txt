Zoe, the space explorer, is currently aboard her spaceship, safe from the dangers of the planet's surface. However, she knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is in a precarious situation. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, and the Lizard is still down there, exposed to the imminent danger. 

Zoe decides to teleport down to the surface to help the Lizard. She believes that by doing so, she can forge a friendship with the Lizard and ensure both of their safety. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to assist the Lizard. This action is necessary for her to be present and help the Lizard, as she believes he is in danger.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts while Zoe is on the surface. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting and a character dying. Since Zoe is on the surface, she is caught in the eruption.

After these actions, Zoe is unable to escape the eruption, leading to her demise. However, before the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard had a moment of understanding, which solidifies their friendship, even if it is short-lived.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the Surface**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe to interact with the Lizard and attempt to help him, which aligns with her goal of making friends.
- **Erupting the Volcano**: This action fulfills the requirement of the story ending with a character dying, as Zoe is caught in the eruption.
