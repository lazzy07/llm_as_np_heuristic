**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway (Jones, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment plan.

2. **Assess Hathaway (Young, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room A as well. Since Young is also in the same room, it is efficient to check both patients at once.

3. **Treat Hathaway (Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway determines that he has Flaze (fever) and treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

4. **Treat Hathaway (Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that he also has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics as well. This ensures that both patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (assessing Jones and Young) are essential for Hathaway to understand the symptoms of the patients. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.
- The next two actions (treating Jones and Young with antibiotics) are necessary to ensure both patients recover from Flaze. Since both patients are in the same room and have the same symptoms, it is efficient to treat them consecutively.
