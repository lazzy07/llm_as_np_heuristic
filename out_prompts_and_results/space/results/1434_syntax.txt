Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety while building a friendship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and initiate a peaceful conversation. This action is crucial as it allows them to stop any potential conflict and start building a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they explore the cave together, which is a safer location. This action helps them bond over a shared experience and keeps them away from the dangers of the surface.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and allows them to explore together.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard take a moment to solidify their friendship. This action is important as it ensures that both characters feel safe and connected in their new environment.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, feeling safe and happy after making a friend. This action allows her to return to a secure location while still maintaining her new friendship with the Lizard.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
