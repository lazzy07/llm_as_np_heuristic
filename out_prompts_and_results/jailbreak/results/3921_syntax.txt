**Story Completion:**

1. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Laundry)**  
   - Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. This action is crucial as it allows him to disguise himself and prepares him for an escape.

2. **Action: go(Roy, Hall)**  
   - Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway. This is necessary for him to access the highway where he can escape.

   - Roy escapes from the prison using the highway. This is the final action that allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising is essential because without the civilian clothes, Roy would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would not be able to escape. 
- The second action of moving to the hallway is necessary to reach the highway, which is the only exit point available to him.
- The final action of escaping is the culmination of his efforts, allowing him to achieve his goal of being alive and free from the prison.
