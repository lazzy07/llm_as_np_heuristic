1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) to be closer to Alex (C1) and Casey (C3).
   - **Reason**: This action allows Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey, facilitating further interactions.

2. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2) while in the bedroom (R12).
   - **Reason**: This action communicates Blake's desire for the chocolates to Casey, which is necessary for Casey to understand what Blake wants.

3. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake in the bedroom (R12).
