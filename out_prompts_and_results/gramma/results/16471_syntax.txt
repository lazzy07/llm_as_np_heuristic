To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the TomCoin that the Merchant has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count without risking confrontation with the Guard, who is also present in the Market.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to ensure that she has coins secured in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first robbing the Merchant to gain coins and then securing those coins in her camp.
