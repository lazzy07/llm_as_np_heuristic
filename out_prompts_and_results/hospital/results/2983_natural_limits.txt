Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. With a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she knows that she must act quickly to help the patients.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who need her attention.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Young, Dr. Hathaway can assign a patient to an exam room, which is essential for treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to manage another patient, ensuring that all patients are assigned to exam rooms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - Assessing Young will help Dr. Hathaway identify the symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this treatment will make Young healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
