To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A and has a workload of 1, they can admit Young, who is in the Admissions room, to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After admitting Young, Hathaway can assess them to determine their symptoms. This is crucial for identifying the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (which is likely since we have not established their symptoms yet), Hathaway can treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway can walk back to the Admissions room and assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (which is likely since we have not established their symptoms yet), Hathaway can treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring they are healthy.
