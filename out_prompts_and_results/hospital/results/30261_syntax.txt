To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and Ross is assigned to that room, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can walk to PatientRoomC to assess Jones. This is important to determine Jones's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway can assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is essential for Jones's recovery.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.
