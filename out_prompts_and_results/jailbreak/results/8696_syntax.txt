**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the pack of cigarettes that he stole earlier. However, he also knows that the bully is a threat to both of them.

1. **Lock the Gym**: Roy moves to the hallway and locks the gym door. This prevents the bully from coming out and threatening them while they plan their next move. 
   
2. **Go to the Hall**: Roy then goes to the hallway to ensure he can access the vents and make his way to the highway.

3. **Vent to the Highway**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room.

4. **Disguise**: Once on the highway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself, making it easier to escape without being recognized.

5. **Escape**: Finally, Roy escapes from the prison, successfully achieving his goal of being alive and free.
