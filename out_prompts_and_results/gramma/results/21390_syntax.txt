To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit starts at the Cottage and walks to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Merchant.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit then walks to the Market, where the Merchant and the Guard are located. This is crucial as the Bandit needs to be near the Merchant to rob her.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs the Merchant to take the coin she is carrying. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to prepare for her next move.

5. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins in the chest, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Cottage and moves to the Crossroads to get closer to the Market.
- By walking to the Market, the Bandit positions herself to interact with the Merchant, who has coins.
