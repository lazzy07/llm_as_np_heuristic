To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the bank and the clerk has 1 money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba is greedy and wants to have money, so he decides to steal from the clerk.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money. He is aware that the clerk has money and that he can take it.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving up the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, fulfilling his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
