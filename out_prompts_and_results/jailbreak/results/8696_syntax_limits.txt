After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. Knowing that the bully is currently in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes, Roy feels threatened and wants to eliminate that threat. He quickly moves to the hallway from the kitchen.

Once in the hallway, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym. He knows that if he can lock the gym door, he can confront the bully without any interruptions.
