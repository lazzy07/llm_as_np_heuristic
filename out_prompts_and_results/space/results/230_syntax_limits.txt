Zoe, having just teleported back to the surface, realizes the danger of the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to improve their relationship.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing chaos on the surface. This action is essential as it leads to the climax of the story where one character may face dire consequences.

4. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: In the chaos of the eruption, the Lizard, in a moment of panic, accidentally causes Zoe to be caught in the eruption. This action results in Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

Through these actions, the story concludes with the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard having made a friend, albeit too late to save Zoe.
