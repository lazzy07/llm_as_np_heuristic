To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. Talia's happiness can be secured through marriage, and her wealth can be increased by acquiring money. Since Vince has money, Talia can marry him and then take the money from him.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal and they get married, which makes Talia happy.
2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: After the marriage, Talia takes the money from Vince, increasing her wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy (due to the marriage) and wealthy (due to acquiring the money).

### Explanation of Actions:

- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth, as she takes the money from Vince after their marriage.
