To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank, and Bambi is also in the forest. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves to the bank to confront the clerk and demand money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only character with money, and Bubba needs to be at the same location to interact with him.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot the clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is the final step to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to access the money held by the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it removes the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without resistance.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This is the final action that fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
