Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the hero's coin, stands at the crossroads with the merchant, who has the medicine. Knowing that the guard is at the market and unaware of the bandit's whereabouts, Tom decides to take action. 

First, Tom robs the merchant, taking the medicine from her. This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the cottage carrying the medicine, and he needs to acquire it from the merchant. 

Next, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action is essential as it allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine in hand.

With these two actions, Tom successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
