To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) to be with Casey after giving them the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps maintain the connection between the characters.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry, making them happy. 

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: This action directly gives Casey the item they want, fulfilling their goal of happiness.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: While this does not affect Casey's happiness directly, it keeps the narrative cohesive by having Alex and Casey together.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:
