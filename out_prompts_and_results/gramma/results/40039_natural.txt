To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the hero.** This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the hero, who is armed and poses a threat. By attacking the hero, the bandit can potentially loot the hero's coin.

2. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the corpse of the hero.** After successfully attacking the hero, the bandit can loot the hero's coin, which adds to her collection of coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action is taken to return to the bandit camp, where the bandit can store her coins in the chest.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Attack the hero:** The bandit needs to remove the hero as a competitor and gain access to the hero's coin.
- **Loot the hero's coin:** This directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying more coins.
- **Walk to the bandit camp:** The bandit needs to return to her base to secure her coins.
- **Place coins in the chest:** This fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins stored safely.
