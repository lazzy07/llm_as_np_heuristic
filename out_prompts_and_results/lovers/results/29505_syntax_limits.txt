To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Currently, I2 is in the bathroom (R12), but its location is unknown to Blake. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom where the jewelry is located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up and give it to Blake.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the bathroom. This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room where Blake is located. This action is necessary to bring the jewelry to Blake.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
