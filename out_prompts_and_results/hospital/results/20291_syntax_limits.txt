### Story Completion

After the events that have already occurred, Hathaway decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms to determine their symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.
   
2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is also crucial for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

By assessing both patients, Hathaway can accurately diagnose and treat Jones, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
