1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money he desires, and Bambi is already dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
