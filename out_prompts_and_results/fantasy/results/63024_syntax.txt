To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory will travel to the Cave where Talia is located. This is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and potentially gain the treasure.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Once Rory arrives at the Cave, he will pick up the Treasure. This action is essential for Rory to increase his wealth.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the Treasure, Rory will travel back to the Village. This is necessary for him to be in a location where he can interact with Vince and potentially share his wealth.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory will marry Talia in the Village. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both of them happy.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory will become hungry. This action is included to fulfill the condition of Rory not being hungry, as he will soon eat.

6. **eat(Vince, Rory, Village)**: Finally, Gargax will eat Rory. This action is included to ensure that Rory's goal of being wealthy is achieved, as he will have the treasure when he is eaten.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- Rory travels to the Cave to meet Talia and pick up the Treasure.
- He picks up the Treasure to increase his wealth.
- Rory returns to the Village to marry Talia, which makes them both happy.
- Rory becomes hungry to fulfill the condition of not being hungry.
- Gargax eats Rory, ensuring that Rory's wealth is preserved in the story.
