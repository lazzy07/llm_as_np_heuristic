To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money, which is his goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene after committing the theft.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry, so he decides to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank to confront the clerk again. This action is necessary to ensure that he can take further actions if needed.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If Bubba feels threatened or if the clerk tries to stop him, he will shoot the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate any potential threat to his escape with the money.

6. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: If Bubba encounters Bambi in the forest, he will eat her. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger if he has not already eaten.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. Bubba steals the money from the clerk using his rifle.
2. He then goes back to the forest to escape.
3. Bubba decides to eat to satisfy his hunger.
4. He returns to the bank to ensure he has secured his escape.
5. If necessary, he shoots the clerk to eliminate any threats.
6. Finally, he eats Bambi if he encounters her.
