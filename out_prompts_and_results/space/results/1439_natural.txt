To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and ensure they are in the same location, which is essential for their friendship to be solidified.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.**  
   - Since they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures they remain allies, which is important for the story's resolution.

3. **The volcano erupts.**  
   - This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, leading to the next action.

4. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption, which is a key part of the story's conclusion.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard is maintained until the end.
