**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess and admit Jones, who is currently in Admissions.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B. (This action is necessary to assign Jones to an exam room so that Dr. Hathaway can assess him.)
3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B. (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to be in the same room as Jones to assess his symptoms.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown. (This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition, even though the symptoms are unknown.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A for Jarkis using steroids. (This action is necessary because Ross has a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, he can treat Ross correctly without making a mistake.)
6. Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C for Flaze using antibiotics. (This action is necessary because Young is also in Admissions and has unknown symptoms, but since he is the only remaining patient, Dr. Hathaway can treat him for Flaze, assuming he has a fever.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action allows Dr. Hathaway to move to Admissions to see Jones, who is waiting to be assigned to an exam room.
- The second action assigns Jones to Patient Room B, which is necessary for him to receive care.
- The third action ensures Dr. Hathaway is in the same room as Jones to assess his condition.
- The fourth action is crucial for understanding Jones's health status, even if the symptoms are unknown.
- The fifth action treats Ross correctly for Jarkis, ensuring he becomes healthy.
- The sixth action treats Young for Flaze, which is a safe assumption given the context, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
