To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market to be in a location where she can sell her items and interact with Tom, who is currently at the Market.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant buys the coin from Tom, giving him the opportunity to acquire the sword while also increasing her coin count. This action is crucial for the Merchant to gain coins without resorting to criminal activity.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant returns to the Crossroads after the transaction, allowing her to maintain her position without being in a criminal situation.

4. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom moves to the Crossroads, where he can interact with the Merchant again.

5. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant, which is her item. This action allows the Merchant to sell her item and gain another coin, fulfilling her goal of acquiring coins.

6. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant returns to the Market to continue her business and potentially sell more items.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant successfully acquires coins through legitimate means while interacting with Tom, who is also achieving his goal of obtaining the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's movement to the Market allows her to engage in transactions.
- Buying the coin from Tom increases her coin count without committing a crime.
- Returning to the Crossroads keeps her in a neutral position while allowing for further transactions.
- Tom's movement to the Crossroads allows him to buy the medicine, which is beneficial for both characters.
- The final movement of the Merchant back to the Market keeps her in a position to continue her business.
