To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, to ensure the story flows logically, we can include a few actions that reinforce his situation and conclude the story.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba needs to find something to eat.)
3. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba wants to eat, and Bambi is a potential source of food.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** (Bubba can now satisfy his hunger by eating Bambi.)

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and has also satisfied his hunger. The actions taken are necessary to show Bubba's motivations and the consequences of his actions.
