To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway needs to admit Ross to an exam room first. However, since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Jones in PatientRoomA to confirm the symptoms before proceeding with Ross.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This will allow Hathaway to treat Ross in the next step.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in PatientRoomC to determine their symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: After confirming Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms assessed.

5. **Treat Ross**: After admitting Ross and assessing him, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms assessed.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms assessed.

This sequence of actions ensures that all patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms, leading to their health and survival.
