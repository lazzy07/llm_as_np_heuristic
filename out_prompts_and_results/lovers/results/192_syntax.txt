To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R11, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R11) to the bedroom (R12) to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the living room (R22) with the jewelry (I1).

2. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Blake actually wants the jewelry (I2). However, this action is necessary to manipulate the situation.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) to respond to Blake's statement.

4. **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake in the bedroom (R12). This action fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the bedroom (R12) after receiving the jewelry.

Now, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R11, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and facilitate the exchange.
- **tell(C2, C3, I2, R12)**: This action is a strategic lie to manipulate Casey into thinking Blake wants the chocolates, which leads to Casey's actions that ultimately benefit Blake.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to move to Blake's location to give them the item.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: This is the crucial action where Casey gives Blake the jewelry, fulfilling Blake's goal.
- **put_down(C2, I2, R12)**: This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but shows that Blake is now satisfied with the jewelry and no longer needs the chocolates.
