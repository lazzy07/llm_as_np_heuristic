To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is in the dining room (R21) and has given away the jewelry.
- Casey is now in the dining room (R21) and has received the jewelry, making them happy.
- Blake remains in the living room (R21) and is still unhappy, but since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this is acceptable.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to receive the jewelry.
2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
