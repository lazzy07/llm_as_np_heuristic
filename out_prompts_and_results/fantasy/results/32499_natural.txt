To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave, where she currently possesses the treasure. The key to her happiness lies in her relationships with Rory and Vince, as they are both married to her. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Gargax, who is at the cave and desires wealth, sees Vince with the money and decides to eat him. This action removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Rory without the complication of Vince's presence.

2. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body.** - After Gargax eats Vince, Talia can now take the money that Vince had. This action increases Talia's wealth, which is essential for her goal of being wealthy.

3. **Talia proposes to Rory.** - With her newfound wealth, Talia proposes to Rory again. This action is necessary to reaffirm their relationship and ensure Rory's happiness, which indirectly contributes to Talia's happiness as well.

4. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.** - Rory accepts Talia's proposal, which makes both of them happy. This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of happiness.
