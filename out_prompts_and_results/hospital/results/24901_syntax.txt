To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will need to assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. Ross will walk to Exam Room A to be assessed next.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Ross also has a chance to become healthy.

6. **Walk Young to Exam Room A**: Finally, Young will walk to Exam Room A to be assessed after Ross.

7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms.

8. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment.
