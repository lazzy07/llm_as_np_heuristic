Tom is at the Crossroads, carrying the medicine he bought from the merchant. He knows that the bandit is also at the Crossroads, and he believes that the bandit is a criminal. To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, who is at the market.

By reporting the bandit, Tom ensures that the guard will take action against the bandit, which will allow him to safely return to the cottage without the threat of being robbed or attacked. This action is crucial because it eliminates the immediate danger posed by the bandit, allowing Tom to leave the Crossroads without further conflict.

After reporting the bandit, Tom can safely walk back to the cottage with the medicine.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **report(Tom, Bandit, Market)** - Tom reports the bandit to the guard, ensuring that the guard will take action against the bandit.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)** - Tom walks back to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

The story is complete, and Tom has achieved his goal.
