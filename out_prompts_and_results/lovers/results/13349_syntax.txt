To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in R22). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and obtain the item they want.

2. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the item I1 (jewelry) to Casey. This action is necessary because it creates a positive interaction and may lead to Casey being happy, which is important for Alex's happiness as well.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the item I2 (chocolates) with Casey for I3 (the flowers). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to receive the item they want, which is I3, and it also helps Blake to be happy.

4. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the item I3 (flowers) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex receives the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the item they wanted (I3).

### Explanation of Each Action:

- **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)**: This trade allows Casey to get the flowers, which is what they want, and it also helps Blake to be happy.
- **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.
