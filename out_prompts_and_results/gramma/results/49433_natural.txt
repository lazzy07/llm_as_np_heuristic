The bandit, having just looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. The guard, who is armed and present at the market, poses a threat to the bandit. However, the bandit is confident in her ability to escape with the medicine and the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

1. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads. (This action allows the bandit to create distance from the guard and avoid immediate confrontation.)
2. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. (This action takes the bandit to her preferred location where she can secure her coins and the medicine.)

At the bandit camp, the bandit can safely store the medicine and any coins she has acquired, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of walking to the crossroads is necessary to evade the guard and create a safe distance.
- The second action of walking to the bandit camp is essential for the bandit to secure her loot and fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.
