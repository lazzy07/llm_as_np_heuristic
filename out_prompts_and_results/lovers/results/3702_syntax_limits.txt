In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the dining room (R21), while Casey and Blake are in the living room (R22) with the chocolates (I2) and the jewelry (I3) respectively. 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action is taken:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room where Casey and Blake are located. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to potentially obtain the flowers.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because Casey wants to make Alex happy, and by giving the chocolates, Casey can help Alex achieve their goal.

3. **put_down(C1, I2, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates in the living room. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have the flowers to be happy, and putting down the chocolates allows for the next action.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
