Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger surrounding her. The Lizard, also on the surface, senses Zoe's presence and is cautious. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends, but they are currently enemies due to their lack of relationship.

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action is taken to initiate a conversation and show a willingness to engage, which is necessary for building a friendship.
   
2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows both characters to stop being enemies and start working towards their mutual goals of safety and friendship.

3. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** - This action reinforces the peace made by Zoe, solidifying their new relationship and ensuring that both characters are now friends.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - This action is taken to find a safe location away from the dangers of the surface, ensuring both characters' health and safety.

5. **The volcano erupts on the surface.** - This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have moved to the cave, ensuring they are safe from the eruption.
