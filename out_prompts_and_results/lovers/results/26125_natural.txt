To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers and ensuring their happiness, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey currently has the flowers in the living room, and Alex wants them. 

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers directly from Casey, fulfilling Alex's desire.

3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to understand the situation better and potentially help with their own goal later.

4. **Blake sees that Alex is now happy with the flowers.**  
   - This action is implied as a result of the previous actions, confirming that Alex has achieved their goal.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Casey picks up the flowers:** This is the first step to ensure Alex can get what they want. Without this action, the flowers would remain unattainable for Alex.
- **Casey gives the flowers to Alex:** This directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.
- **Blake moves to the living room:** This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps set the stage for Blake's future actions and understanding of the situation.
- **Blake sees that Alex is happy:** This is a narrative conclusion that shows the outcome of the actions taken.
