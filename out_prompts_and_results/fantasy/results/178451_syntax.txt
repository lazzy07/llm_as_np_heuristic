2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action fulfills Talia's need for happiness through her relationship with Vince, as they both have a mutual relationship.
