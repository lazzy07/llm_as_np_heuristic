To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Blake.

2. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Casey will have given away the jewelry and will still be unhappy since they want chocolates (I2).
- Alex remains unhappy as they want flowers (I1).

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness.
