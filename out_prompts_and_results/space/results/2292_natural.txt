Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe and healthy, Zoe needs to take the following actions:

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially become friends. 

2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes peace.**  
   - Since Zoe and the Lizard are not fighting, this action allows them to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, Zoe can fulfill her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.**  
   - This action ensures that both characters are safe from the erupting surface. By moving to the cave, they can avoid the dangers of the volcano and remain healthy.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard share stories and bond in the cave.**  
   - This action solidifies their friendship and allows them to connect, ensuring that both characters feel safe and healthy in each other's company.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe and healthy.
