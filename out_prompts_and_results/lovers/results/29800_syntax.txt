To complete the story and ensure that Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3), we can focus on the actions that will allow Alex to obtain the flowers.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to give them to Alex.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will still have the jewelry (I3) and will remain happy.
- Blake's happiness is not directly affected in this scenario, but since Alex is happy, Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy is also achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be able to give the flowers to Alex. Without moving to the dining room, Casey cannot access the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This action is the key to making Alex happy, as it directly provides Alex with the item they want.
