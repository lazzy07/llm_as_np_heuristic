To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to obtain the treasure while also addressing their hunger. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax, being hungry, decides to eat Talia, who is at the same location. This action eliminates Talia, allowing Gargax to satisfy their hunger and also take any items Talia had, although she has none.

2. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: After eating Talia, Gargax travels to the Cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the treasure.

3. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave. This action fulfills Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring the treasure) and is no longer hungry (since they ate Talia).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: This action is crucial for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, which is one of their primary goals. By eating Talia, Gargax also removes a potential obstacle (another character) from the story.
- **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to access the treasure, which is located in the cave. Without this action, Gargax would not be able to achieve their goal of wealth.
- **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: This action directly leads to Gargax achieving their goal of wealth by acquiring the treasure.
