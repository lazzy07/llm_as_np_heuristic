**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, in the hospital admissions room, is aware that they have three patients to attend to: Ross in exam room A, Young in exam room B, and Jones in the admissions room. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake if they assess a patient. To ensure all patients are treated correctly, Hathaway decides to first assess Ross in exam room A.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway walks to exam room A and assesses Ross. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, they might make a mistake, but they proceed to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. Assuming Ross has Flaze (fever), Hathaway administers antibiotics, which successfully makes Ross healthy.

3. **Walk to Young**: Hathaway then walks to exam room B to assess Young. After assessing Young, they treat him with steroids for Jarkis, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
