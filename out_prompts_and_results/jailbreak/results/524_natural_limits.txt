**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them. This action is crucial because it secures their immediate safety from the bully's threats.

After locking the gym door, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will allow him to escape from the prison without being recognized. 

With the gym locked and the bully trapped inside, Roy then crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he arrives at the highway, he takes off the civilian clothes, ensuring he is not seen as a prisoner anymore, and successfully escapes from the prison.
