To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

5. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is crucial to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered. This prevents any mistakes that could arise from Hathaway's workload being too high.
- **Treating each patient** with the correct treatment based on their symptoms will ensure that they all become healthy.
