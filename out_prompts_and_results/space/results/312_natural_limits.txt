Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the dangers surrounding her. She sees the Lizard, who is also on the surface, and realizes that they both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard peacefully.

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe extends her hand and introduces herself to the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are not fighting, which would jeopardize their safety.

2. **Walk to the Cave**: After establishing a friendly relationship, Zoe suggests they explore the cave together. This action allows them to move to a safer location away from the dangers of the surface, ensuring both characters remain healthy and safe.

3. **Make Peace Again**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard share stories about their worlds and experiences, further solidifying their friendship. This action reinforces their bond and ensures they both feel safe and healthy in each other's company.

4. **Teleport to the Ship**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, feeling accomplished and safe, knowing she has made a friend in the Lizard. This action allows her to return to a secure environment while maintaining her new friendship.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making a friend.
