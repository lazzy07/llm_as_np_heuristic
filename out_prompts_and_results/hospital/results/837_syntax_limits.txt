**Story Completion:**

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Young to exam room C to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

2. **Assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room B. Since Ross is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on him. The symptom is unknown, but Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy.

3. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room C. Again, the symptom is unknown, but Hathaway believes Young is alive and healthy.

4. **Treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. Since Ross is alive and healthy, this treatment is appropriate, and he becomes healthy.

5. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, assuming he has Jarkis. Since Young is alive and healthy, this treatment is appropriate, and he becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room, which is crucial for assessment and treatment.
- The next two actions involve assessing the patients to determine their symptoms, which is essential for providing the correct treatment.
- The last two actions involve treating the patients based on the assumed diseases. Since both patients are alive and healthy, the treatments are appropriate, leading to their recovery.
