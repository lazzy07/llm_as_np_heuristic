**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomB**  
   - **Explanation:** Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Jones is in PatientRoomB, Hathaway assesses him to identify if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, treatment: antibiotics, room: PatientRoomB**  
   - **Explanation:** After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: Admissions**  
   - **Explanation:** With Jones treated and healthy, Hathaway now turns to Young, who is still in Admissions. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms, which is necessary to provide the appropriate treatment.

**Final Plan Explanation:**
- The actions taken ensure that Hathaway first assesses Jones to identify his condition and then treats him correctly, leading to his recovery. Afterward, Hathaway assesses Young to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy. This sequence of actions is efficient and directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
