**Story Completion:**

After assessing Ross in PatientRoomA, Hathaway realizes that Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by the fever (SymptomA). To ensure Ross's health, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address Jones, who is still in the admissions room. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 2, they can still admit another patient without making a mistake.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Jones, who is showing no symptoms yet. However, Hathaway believes that Jones is healthy and does not need treatment at this moment.

With Ross treated successfully and Jones assessed, Hathaway has ensured that both patients are on the path to health.
