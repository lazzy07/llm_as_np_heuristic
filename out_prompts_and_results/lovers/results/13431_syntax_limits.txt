In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item they already have, which is the flowers (I1). However, both Casey (C3) and Blake (C2) are unhappy because they do not have the items they want. To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, they need to ensure that they keep the flowers and do not give them away.

Since Alex already has the flowers, they can simply take a moment to appreciate them, which will make them happy. The other characters can work on their own happiness afterward.

Hereâ€™s the action that Alex will take:

1. **Action**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R22). 

This action is necessary because it reinforces Alex's possession of the flowers, ensuring they are happy. 

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

In this story, Alex achieves their goal of happiness by ensuring they have the flowers, which they already possess. The other characters can then focus on their own happiness in subsequent actions.
