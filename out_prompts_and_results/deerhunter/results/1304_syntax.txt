1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and obtain money. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the Bank, Bubba will use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the Clerk, who is the only other character with money.
