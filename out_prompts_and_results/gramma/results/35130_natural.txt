**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to rob the merchant. Since the merchant is not armed, the bandit successfully takes the medicine from the merchant.
2. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, carrying the medicine and leaving the merchant at the crossroads.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Rob the Merchant:** The bandit takes the medicine from the merchant because it helps her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible. The merchant is not armed, making her an easy target for robbery.
2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp:** After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit returns to her preferred location, the bandit camp, where she can store her loot (the medicine) and potentially gather more coins.
