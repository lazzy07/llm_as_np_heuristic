**Story Completion:**

After venting through to the highway, Ernest finds himself outside the prison, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that he must act quickly to ensure his escape before the guards notice his absence. 

Meanwhile, inside the gym, Roy is still threatened by the bully. He knows he needs to find a way to escape as well, but he is currently trapped and unable to act without risking his life. 

Ernest, now on the highway and disguised, takes a moment to gather his thoughts. He knows that he can escape now that he is wearing the civilian clothes. He takes a deep breath and makes his move.

**Actions Taken:**
1. **escape(Ernest, Highway)** - This action allows Ernest to leave the prison successfully, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The only action taken by Ernest is to escape. Since he is already on the highway and disguised, this is the final step to ensure his safety and fulfill his desire to be alive without threats. 

Roy remains in the gym, still threatened by the bully, but since the story focuses on Ernest achieving his goal, his fate is left unresolved.
