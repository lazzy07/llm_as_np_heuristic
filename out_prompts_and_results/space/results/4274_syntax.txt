Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are currently safe and healthy, but the surface is dangerous. To ensure their safety and to foster friendship, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the dangerous surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action helps to ensure that both characters are together in a safe location.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their friendship in a safe environment. It solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety away from the dangerous surface. This action is crucial for her goal of being healthy and safe.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Cave, Ship)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship as well, ensuring that both characters are safe together. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being healthy and safe.

By taking these actions, Zoe and the Lizard successfully achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.
