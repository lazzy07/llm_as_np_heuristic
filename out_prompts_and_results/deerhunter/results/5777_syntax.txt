To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is greedy and wants to take the clerk's money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining money, which is his goal.

2. **Go**: After stealing the money, Bubba will go from the bank to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal of obtaining money, but it allows Bubba to escape the scene after committing the theft.

Hereâ€™s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and takes the money from him. This action is crucial as it fulfills Bubba's greed and achieves his goal of obtaining money.

2. **Go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After successfully stealing the money, Bubba decides to leave the bank and head to the forest. This action allows him to escape and avoid any potential consequences from the theft.
