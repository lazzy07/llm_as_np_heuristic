To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the item they want.

2. **give(C1, I3, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. Since Alex is already happy with the flowers (I1), they can help Casey achieve happiness by giving them the item they want.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is happy with I1.
- Casey is now happy with I3.
- Blake remains unhappy with I2, but the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to reach Alex, who has the item Casey wants.
- **give(C1, I3, C2, R21)**: This action allows Alex to fulfill Casey's desire, thus making Casey happy.
