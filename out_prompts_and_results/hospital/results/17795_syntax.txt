To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young is assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Next, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room B. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Jones in Exam Room C. This will complete the assessment of all patients, allowing Hathaway to know the symptoms of each patient.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young based on the identified symptoms. If Young has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the identified symptoms. The same logic applies here: antibiotics for Flaze and steroids for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the identified symptoms. Again, the treatment will depend on whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is crucial to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered. This prevents any mistakes that could arise from Hathaway's workload being at three or more.
- **Treating each patient** after assessment ensures that they receive the appropriate care based on their specific disease, leading to their recovery.
