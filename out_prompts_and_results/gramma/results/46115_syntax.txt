To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The Bandit moves to the Merchant's location to confront her and potentially rob her of the coins.
2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Merchant)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins that Tom had just bought from her. This action is possible because the Merchant is unarmed and the Bandit is armed.
3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit then takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

These actions are necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can. The first action allows her to reach the Merchant, the second action allows her to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, and the third action ensures she maximizes her coin collection.
