To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is found to have Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids. This will make Young healthy.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is found to have Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics. This will make Ross healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to Exam Room A**: After treating the other patients, Hathaway will walk Jones to Exam Room A to assess him. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This will make Jones healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Young and Ross**: These actions are crucial to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating Young and Ross**: These actions are necessary to ensure that both patients recover from their respective diseases.
- **Walking and Assessing Jones**: These actions ensure that Jones is also evaluated and treated, completing Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics/steroids, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
```

Note: The last action for treating Jones specifies "antibiotics/steroids" because it depends on the symptoms assessed.
