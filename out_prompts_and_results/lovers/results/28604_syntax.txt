To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is important for social interaction and to ensure that Alex is not alone after obtaining the item.

4. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they have the jewelry. This action is to communicate their happiness and share the good news, which is part of Alex's goal of being happy.

5. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that they have the jewelry. Similar to the previous action, this is to share their happiness with Blake as well.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
