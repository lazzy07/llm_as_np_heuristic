In the current situation, Blake (C3) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Blake needs to acquire the item I2. 

Since Casey (C2) is also in the same room (R22) and is currently holding the item I1, Blake can trade with Casey. Blake can tell Casey that they want I1, and since Casey believes that Blake wants I2, they can agree to trade. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the item I1 (which they believe Casey wants) for the item I2 (which Blake wants). This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy.

After this trade, Blake will have the item they want (I2), making them happy.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they desire (I2) while also satisfying Casey's belief that they are trading for something they want. This is the most efficient way for Blake to achieve their goal in the current situation.
