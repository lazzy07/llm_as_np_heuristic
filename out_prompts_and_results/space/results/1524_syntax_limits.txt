Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and is not aware of her presence. She decides to make peace with the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship. 

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**

This action is chosen because Zoe's goal is to make friends with other creatures, and since she is currently in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface, she can initiate a peaceful interaction. By making peace, she can ensure that both she and the Lizard feel safe and healthy, thus achieving her goal of friendship.

After this action, the relationship between Zoe and the Lizard improves, and they both feel safe and healthy, fulfilling their mutual desires for friendship.
