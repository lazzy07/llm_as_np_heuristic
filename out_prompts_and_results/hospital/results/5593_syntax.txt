To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Ross's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. This is crucial because without assessing Ross, Hathaway cannot know whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway should assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is important because Young's health status needs to be evaluated to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young based on assessment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
