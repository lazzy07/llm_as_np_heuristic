To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey (C3) tells Blake (C2) that they want the chocolates (I2)** while in the living room (R21). This is a strategic lie to mislead Blake into thinking that Casey is not interested in the jewelry, which Blake currently has.
   - **Action:** `tell(C3, C2, I2, R21)`

2. **Blake (C2) believes Casey and picks up the chocolates (I2)** from the living room (R21). This action is necessary for Blake to feel like they are helping Casey, even though it is not what Casey truly wants.
   - **Action:** `pick_up(C2, I2, R21)`

3. **Blake (C2) moves to the bedroom (R22)** to be closer to Alex (C1) and to potentially give them the chocolates later.
   - **Action:** `move(C2, R21, R22)`

4. **Casey (C3) moves to the bedroom (R22)** to be near Alex and Blake, where the jewelry (I3) is located.
   - **Action:** `move(C3, R21, R22)`

5. **Casey (C3) picks up the jewelry (I3)** from the bedroom (R22). This is the item that Casey truly wants, and now they can achieve their happiness.
   - **Action:** `pick_up(C3, I3, R22)`

6. **Casey (C3) moves to the living room (R21)** to celebrate their happiness with Blake and Alex.
   - **Action:** `move(C3, R22, R21)`

At this point, Casey has the jewelry they wanted, making them happy. The actions taken were necessary to ensure that Casey could obtain the item they desired while also maintaining the dynamics of the relationships between the characters.
