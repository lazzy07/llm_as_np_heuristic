Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: This action assigns Ross to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess him later. It also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3, which is critical for the next step.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. Since Young is in Patient Room C, this is a necessary step to understand his condition. Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, which means he might make a mistake, but he will still proceed to treat Young.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. If Young actually has Flaze, he will become healthy. If not, he may die, but this is a risk Dr. Hathaway must take to fulfill his goal of treating patients.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has done his best to ensure the health of his patients, even if the outcome for Young is uncertain.
