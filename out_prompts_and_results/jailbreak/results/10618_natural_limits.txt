**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, feels a surge of hope. He knows that Ernest is still in the kitchen, unaware of the danger posed by the bully. The bully, still in the gym, believes both Roy and Ernest are in the kitchen, which gives Roy a crucial advantage.

Roy decides to take action. He knows that the only way to ensure both he and Ernest can escape safely is to eliminate the threat of the bully. With the knife in the kitchen, Ernest is in a precarious position, but Roy has a plan. He sneaks back through the vent into the hallway, then makes his way to the gym. 

Once inside the gym, Roy locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. The bully, surprised and furious, turns to confront Roy. In a swift motion, Roy pulls out the knife and, fueled by the need to protect himself and Ernest, he kills the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now return to the highway and escape with Ernest.
