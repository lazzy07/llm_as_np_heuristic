To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Bribe(President, Villain, Money)**: The villain uses the stolen money to bribe the president. This action is crucial because it allows the villain to gain control over the president by leveraging the money they have stolen. The president, upon receiving the bribe, will be inclined to follow the villain's wishes.

2. **Coerce(Villain, Hero, Money)**: After gaining control over the president, the villain can now coerce the hero into wanting the president to have the money. This action is necessary to ensure that the hero does not interfere with the villain's plans, as the hero will now fear the villain's influence over the president.

With these two actions, the villain successfully controls the president, achieving the desired ending.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bribe**: This action is essential for the villain to gain direct control over the president, as it creates a dependency on the villain for financial support.
- **Coerce**: This action ensures that the hero is manipulated into a position where they cannot oppose the villain, as they will now believe that the president's control over the money is in their best interest.
