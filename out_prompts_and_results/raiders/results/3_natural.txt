**Story Completion:**

Indiana Jones, realizing the Nazis are also after the Ark, decides to act quickly. He knows that the Ark is dangerous and must not fall into the wrong hands. 

1. **Indiana digs up the Ark.** (He believes it is at Tanis and wants to secure it before the Nazis can get to it.)
2. **Indiana opens the Ark.** (He hopes that by opening it, he can harness its power for good, knowing it is dangerous but believing he can handle it.)

As Indiana opens the Ark, he is engulfed in a blinding light. The Ark's dangerous nature reveals itself, but Indiana is able to withstand it, becoming immortal. With this newfound power, he can now ensure that the Ark does not fall into the hands of the Nazis or anyone else.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Digging up the Ark** is necessary because Indiana needs to secure the Ark before the Nazis can take it. This action directly aligns with his goal of ensuring the Ark is in safe hands.
- **Opening the Ark** is a risky move, but Indiana believes he can handle the consequences. By opening it, he not only secures his own immortality but also ensures that the Ark remains with him, preventing the Nazis from using it for their own nefarious purposes.
