To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (R21). This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to achieve their goal.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where Alex and Casey are (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamic and allows Blake to be aware of the situation.

4. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R21)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This action is included to show Blake's desire for happiness and to keep the narrative flowing, but it does not affect Alex's happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "tell(C3, C1, I2, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it keeps Blake in the loop and engaged in the story.
- **tell(C3, C1, I2, R21)**: This action reflects Blake's desire and maintains the narrative flow, even though it does not impact Alex's happiness directly.
