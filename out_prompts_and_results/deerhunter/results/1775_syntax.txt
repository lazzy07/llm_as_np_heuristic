To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a rifle, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also at the bank and is alive. Bubba's greed is high, and he has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry, and he needs to eat. This action is necessary for him to satisfy his hunger.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the clerk, so this action is already completed.
3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him and take all the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry and needs to eat to maintain his health.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial for Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
