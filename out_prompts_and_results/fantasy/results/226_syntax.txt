To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, who has proposed to her. Since Talia already has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, the next step is for her to accept Rory's proposal and marry him, which will also make her happy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action is necessary because it leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling one of her goals.
2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.
3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be with Talia after their marriage.
4. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money in the village, which he can then share with Talia, contributing to her wealth.

After these actions, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Rory, and she will also be wealthy because she has the treasure and can potentially share in the money Rory has picked up.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **accept**: This is crucial for Talia to achieve happiness as it formalizes her commitment to Rory.
- **marry**: This action directly leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling her emotional goal.
- **travel**: Rory's travel to the cave is necessary for him to be with Talia after their marriage.
- **pickup**: Rory picking up the money ensures that Talia's wealth increases, aligning with her goal of being wealthy.
