To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bubba already has 1 money, we can focus on confirming Bambi's status. The following actions will achieve this:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and he has just shot Bambi. Eating Bambi will confirm that Bambi is dead and satisfy Bubba's hunger.

2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action directly confirms that Bambi is dead, as Bubba consumes the animal he has shot.

Now, let's outline the story with the actions taken:

1. Bubba decides to eat. (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
2. Bubba eats Bambi. (This confirms Bambi is dead and fulfills Bubba's hunger.)

After these actions, we have:
- Bubba is alive.
- The clerk is alive.
- Bambi is not alive (confirmed by Bubba eating her).
- Bubba has 1 money.
- The clerk has 0 money.

Thus, the story ends with both conditions satisfied: Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat.",
    "Bubba eats Bambi."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that the story concludes with Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead, fulfilling the requirements of the task.
