**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, still in the kitchen, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he has the knife. He quickly moves to the hallway, where he can access the gym. 

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it secures the bully in the gym, allowing Roy to confront him without the risk of being attacked. 

With the gym door locked, Roy enters the gym, confronting the bully. He brandishes the knife, ready to defend himself and Ernest. In a swift motion, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
