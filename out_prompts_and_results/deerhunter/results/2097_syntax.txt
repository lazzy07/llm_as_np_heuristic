To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and potentially steal the money. This action is necessary to move Bubba closer to his goal of obtaining money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the Clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the Forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the Bank with the stolen money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi in the Forest. This action fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead, which is one of the possible endings.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the Clerk and obtain money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the Clerk at gunpoint, achieving his goal of acquiring money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Ensures Bubba has a safe place to go after committing the theft, maintaining his safety.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second condition of the story's ending.
