2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** After ensuring her safety, Zoe returns to the surface to invite the Lizard to join her on the spaceship, where they can be safe together. This action reinforces their friendship and shows her commitment to the Lizard's safety as well.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the spaceship together.** This final action solidifies their bond and ensures that both characters are safe from the dangers of the surface. By walking together, they can communicate and strengthen their friendship further.

Through these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
