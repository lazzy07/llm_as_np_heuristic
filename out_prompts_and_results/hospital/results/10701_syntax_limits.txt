**Story Completion:**

After assessing Jones in Patient Room A, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). However, Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Jones immediately with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis.

Next, Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he is also showing symptoms of Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids as well, ensuring that both patients are treated correctly.

Finally, Hathaway walks to Admissions again to assess Young. Young is also showing symptoms of Jarkis, and Hathaway treats Young with steroids, completing the treatment for all patients.
