Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Jones to an exam room. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway assigns him to Exam Room C. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2.

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to correctly identify that Ross has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy and reducing the workload back to 1.

After treating Ross, Hathaway walks back to Exam Room C to assess Jones. Since Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway, with a workload of 1, can still correctly identify that Jones has Jarkis due to the rash symptom. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully making him healthy.

Finally, Hathaway walks back to Exam Room A to check on Young, who is still in the admissions room. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, making him healthy as well.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
