In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, and they believe that Casey (C2) has it. However, Casey is currently unhappy because they want item I2 (chocolates), which is in the dining room (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to move to the room where Casey is located (R22) and then trade with Casey. Since Casey has item I3 (flowers) and wants item I2 (chocolates), they can trade the flowers for the jewelry that Alex wants.

2. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I1) for the flowers (I3) with Casey. This action ensures that Alex gets the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
