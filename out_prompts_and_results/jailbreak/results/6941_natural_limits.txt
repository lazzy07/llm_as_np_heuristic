**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, he confronts the bully, who is unaware of his presence. With the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen, Ernest takes revenge and kills the bully. 

Now that the bully is no longer a threat, Ernest can safely exit the prison. He quickly makes his way back to the hallway, where he can access the highway. Wearing the civilian clothes, he steps outside the prison gates and escapes to freedom.
