To complete the story, Tom needs to get the medicine from the merchant and return to the cottage. Since Tom is currently at the crossroads and the medicine is with the merchant, he can simply walk to the merchant to retrieve the medicine. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Merchant)**: Tom walks to the merchant to retrieve the medicine. This action is necessary because Tom needs to be at the merchant's location to obtain the medicine.

2. **take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: Tom takes the medicine from the merchant. This action is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks back to the cottage with the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Merchant)**: Tom needs to be at the merchant's location to get the medicine.
- **take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: Tom takes the medicine, which is his goal.
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom returns to the cottage, completing his objective.
