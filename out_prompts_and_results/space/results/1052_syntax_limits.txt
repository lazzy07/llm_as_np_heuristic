Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure their safety. She walks to the cave where the Lizard is located and initiates a conversation, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to stay safe. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing the mutual benefit of friendship, agrees. 

However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts unexpectedly. The eruption is powerful, and Zoe, who is still on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies. The Lizard, being in the cave, is safe from the eruption but feels a deep sense of loss for the friendship that was just beginning.

The actions taken are:
1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and initiate peace, which is crucial for both characters to achieve their goal of safety and friendship.
2. **erupt(Surface)** - This action is the climax of the story, leading to Zoe's death, which fulfills the requirement of the story ending with a character dying.
