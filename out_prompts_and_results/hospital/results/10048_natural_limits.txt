Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones, Ross, and Young, who are all in the admissions room and need to be assessed.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess and treat him. This action also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3, which is critical for the next step.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Dr. Hathaway will assume it is Flaze (fever) due to the workload and treat him accordingly.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C with antibiotics.**  
   - This action is crucial as it directly addresses the assumed condition (Flaze). If successful, Jones will become healthy.

After these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
