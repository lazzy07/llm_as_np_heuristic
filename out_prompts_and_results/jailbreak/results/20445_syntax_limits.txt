**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, crawls through the vents from the hallway to the highway. He knows that this is his chance to escape the prison and leave behind the threats from the bully and the oppressive environment. 

Once he reaches the highway, he takes a moment to look back at the prison, feeling a mix of relief and fear. He knows he has successfully escaped and can finally breathe freely outside the prison walls.

1. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: This action is crucial as it allows Roy to escape the confines of the prison. Since he is already disguised in civilian clothes, he can now safely exit without being recognized as a prisoner.
