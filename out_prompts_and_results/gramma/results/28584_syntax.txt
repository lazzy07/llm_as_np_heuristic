To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially find more coins or interact with the Merchant.
2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads, maintaining her presence near Tom and the Merchant.
3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market, where she can sell items and interact with the Bandit.
4. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coin he has. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count, but it also indirectly benefits the Merchant by removing Tom from the equation.
5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant returns to the Crossroads after the robbery, ensuring she is in a position to sell items or interact with the Bandit.
6. **buy(Merchant, BanditCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys the Bandit’s coins using the coin she received from Tom. This action allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit’s movements to and from the Market are strategic to create opportunities for robbery and to keep the Merchant engaged.
- The Merchant's actions are focused on maintaining her legal status while maximizing her coin collection.
- The robbery of Tom by the Bandit is crucial as it removes Tom from the competition and allows the Merchant to buy coins without any criminal implications.
