In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Market, where she has just attacked Tom and the Merchant. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit has already attacked Tom and the Merchant, she can now loot the Merchant's corpse to obtain the coins she desires.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)** - The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the coins.

**Explanation:**
- The Bandit is already armed and in the Market, where the Merchant has just been killed. Looting the Merchant allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins without needing to engage in further conflict or travel to another location.
