To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to move to a location where she can potentially find more customers or opportunities to sell her items, increasing her chances of acquiring coins.

2. **The hero walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The hero is carrying the medicine and wants to return to the cottage. By moving to the crossroads, he can then proceed to the cottage, which aligns with his goal.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard follows the hero and the merchant to ensure that no criminals are present and to maintain order.

4. **The merchant buys the hero's coin using the medicine.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to exchange an item (medicine) for a coin, thus increasing her coin count without engaging in criminal activity.

5. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - Returning to the market allows the merchant to continue her business and potentially sell more items or acquire more coins.

At this point, the merchant has successfully acquired a coin through a legitimate transaction, achieving her goal without resorting to criminal behavior.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The merchant's movement to the crossroads opens up new opportunities for transactions.
- The hero and guard's movements ensure that the market remains safe and that the hero can eventually return to the cottage with the medicine.
- The transaction between the merchant and the hero is crucial as it allows the merchant to gain a coin, fulfilling her goal.
- The final movement back to the market positions the merchant to continue her business.
