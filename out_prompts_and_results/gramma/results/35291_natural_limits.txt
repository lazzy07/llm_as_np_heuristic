**Story Completion:**

The merchant, realizing that she has the medicine that Tom needs, decides to take action to ensure she can sell it for more coins. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she encounters Tom.

1. The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market. (This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the same location as Tom, allowing her to sell the medicine directly to him.)
   
2. The merchant sells the medicine to Tom for the hero's coin. (This action allows the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as she is selling the medicine legally.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial because it brings the merchant to the market where Tom is located, enabling a transaction to occur.
- The second action is the culmination of the merchant's goal, as she successfully sells the medicine for a coin, thus achieving her objective of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity.
