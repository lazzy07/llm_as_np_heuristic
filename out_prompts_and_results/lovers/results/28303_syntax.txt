To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary to be in the same room as Alex and Blake, who are both in the living room.

4. **give(C3, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to themselves (this is a formality since they already have it). This action is included to signify that Casey has successfully obtained the item they wanted.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
