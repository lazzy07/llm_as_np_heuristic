In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room C with Jones, who has been admitted but has not yet been assessed for symptoms. Ross is in the admissions room, and Young is also in Patient Room C. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing Jones's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway can effectively diagnose and treat Jones, ensuring he becomes healthy.
