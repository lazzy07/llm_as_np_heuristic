To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Merchant takes the Medicine from her location (Camp) to the Bandit Camp.** This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to ensure that the Medicine is not left unguarded and can be used as leverage or a bargaining tool later.

2. **Merchant reports the location of the Bandit to the Guard.** This action is crucial because it allows the Merchant to gain favor with the Guard, who is looking to eliminate criminals. By reporting the Bandit, the Merchant can potentially earn coins or protection from the Guard.

3. **Guard attacks the Bandit.** The Guard will attack the Bandit because he is aware of her criminal status and wants to eliminate her. This action is necessary for the Merchant to ensure that the Bandit is no longer a threat and that she cannot steal from her.

4. **Merchant loots the Banditâ€™s corpse.** After the Bandit is killed, the Merchant can loot her corpse to take any coins the Bandit was carrying. This directly contributes to the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.

5. **Merchant walks to the Market.** The Merchant will walk to the Market to finalize her transactions and ensure her safety after the events that transpired.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal without becoming a criminal, as she does not engage in any illegal activities herself.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Take (Medicine)**: Ensures the Merchant has control over the Medicine, which can be used strategically.
- **Report (Bandit)**: Establishes a relationship with the Guard and positions the Merchant as a law-abiding citizen.
- **Attack (Bandit)**: The Guard eliminates the threat posed by the Bandit, allowing the Merchant to operate freely.
- **Loot (Bandit)**: Directly increases the Merchant's coin count, fulfilling her goal.
- **Walk (Market)**: Moves the Merchant to a safe location where she can continue her business.
