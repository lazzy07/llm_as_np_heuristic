In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I3 (the item in the dining room). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the item I1 (the item in the living room) to Alex. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to receive an item, which may help them achieve happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the item they want (I3), and Blake will also be happy because they have helped Alex.
