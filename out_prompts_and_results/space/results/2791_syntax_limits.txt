In this story, we want to achieve an ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends. 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface of the planet begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, despite the eruption, decide to make peace with each other. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which results in the death of one character. Since Zoe is currently safe on the spaceship, the Lizard, who is on the surface, will be the one affected by the eruption.
