### Story Completion

After admitting Young and Jones to their respective exam rooms, Hathaway decides to assess the patients to determine their symptoms.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomB. Since Jones is alive and healthy, Hathaway will find that Jones has no symptoms, which means he does not have either disease. This action is necessary for Hathaway to confirm Jones's health status.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in PatientRoomA. Similar to Jones, Young is also alive and healthy, and Hathaway will find that Young has no symptoms. This confirms that Young is healthy as well.

3. **Treat Jones**: Since both patients are healthy, Hathaway treats Jones with a placebo (not explicitly mentioned but implied as a treatment for a healthy patient). This action is necessary to ensure that Hathaway has treated Jones, confirming his health status.

By assessing both patients and treating Jones, Hathaway successfully ensures that both patients are confirmed healthy, achieving their goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
