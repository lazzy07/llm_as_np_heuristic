Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the market with the medicine he stole from the merchant. The bandit, also at the market, has just robbed Tom of his coin. The guard, who is also present, is on high alert for any criminal activity.

To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take a bold action. He approaches the bandit and, using the merchant's sword, he attacks and kills her. This action is necessary because it eliminates the immediate threat posed by the bandit and allows Tom to reclaim his coin.

After the bandit falls, Tom loots her body, retrieving his coin. With the coin back in his possession, he can now leave the market without any further issues. He walks back to the crossroads and then continues on to the cottage, successfully carrying the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the bandit**: This action is necessary for Tom to eliminate the threat and reclaim his coin, which is essential for his journey back to the cottage.
2. **Loot the bandit**: This action allows Tom to retrieve his coin, which he needs to ensure he can safely return to the cottage.
