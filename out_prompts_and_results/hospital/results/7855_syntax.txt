To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, he needs to be assigned to an exam room first. However, since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, she can assess Jones without making a mistake.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room. This will help her determine Ross's symptoms.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which will make him healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
