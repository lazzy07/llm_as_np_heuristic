To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **put_down(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I3) in the dining room. This action is included to simulate the process of Casey having the item and then making it available for the next action.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex.

5. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex. This action is crucial as it allows Casey to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy by giving the item to Alex, who can then give it to Blake.

6. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R12) to find Blake. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Blake and help them achieve their happiness.

7. **give(C1, I3, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake. This action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, thus making them happy.

8. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey. This is necessary for Blake to be with Casey and share their happiness.

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have successfully given the jewelry to Blake, who wanted it, thus achieving their goal of making Blake happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I3, R21)",
    "put_down(C3, I3, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C3, I3, C1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "give(C1, I3, C2, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is carefully chosen to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by facilitating the transfer of the jewelry to Blake, who also desires it.
