The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is carrying a sword, the bandit decides to take a different approach. Instead of confronting the hero directly, she quickly walks to the guard, who is also at the market. 

The bandit reports the location of the bandit to the guard, claiming that there is a criminal nearby. The guard, eager to catch a criminal, leaves the market to investigate the bandit's claim. This distraction allows the bandit to quickly return to the chest at the bandit camp, where she retrieves the coins she had hidden there.

With the coins now in her possession, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
