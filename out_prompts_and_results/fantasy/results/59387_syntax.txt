To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged, and also on acquiring the treasure. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels from the cave to the village to be with Rory, as she needs to be with him to fulfill her goal of happiness through their relationship.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave, which will contribute to her wealth.

3. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia returns to the cave to be with Rory again after picking up the treasure.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married, which makes them both happy.

5. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Village)**: Vince, who is in the village, takes the money he has, which is not directly related to Talia's goal but ensures that he remains wealthy and not hungry.

6. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be with Talia after their marriage.

7. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels to the cave, but since he does not care about happiness, he does not interfere with Talia's goals.

At the end of these actions, Talia is married to Rory, which fulfills her happiness goal, and she has the treasure, which fulfills her wealth goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling**: Talia needs to be with Rory to achieve happiness, so she travels to the village. She also needs to return to the cave to ensure she has the treasure and to be with Rory after their marriage.
- **Picking up the Treasure**: This is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.
- **Marrying**: This action directly fulfills Talia's happiness goal.
- **Taking Money**: While this does not directly affect Talia, it ensures that Vince remains wealthy and not hungry, which keeps the story balanced.
- **Traveling Gargax**: Gargax's travel does not affect Talia's goals but keeps the narrative consistent with all characters present.
