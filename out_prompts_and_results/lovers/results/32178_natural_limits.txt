In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry, which is with Blake. To achieve this goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Blake.** - This action is necessary because Casey has the flowers and Blake wants the chocolates. By giving the flowers to Blake, Casey can create a situation where Blake is willing to trade the jewelry for the flowers, as it may make Blake happy to receive something.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is in the bedroom.
- Blake is in the dining room with the flowers.
- Casey is in the dining room with the chocolates.
- The jewelry is still with Blake.

Now, Casey can ask Blake to trade the jewelry for the flowers, achieving their goal of obtaining the jewelry.
