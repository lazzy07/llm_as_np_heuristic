To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the same location as the guard, where she can potentially sell items or negotiate.

2. **The merchant gives the hero's coin to the guard.**  
   - By giving the coin to the guard, the merchant can ensure that she is not seen as a criminal, as she is not keeping the coin for herself. This action also helps the guard in his goal of eliminating criminals, as he will see the merchant as a law-abiding citizen.

3. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to return to a safer location where she can plan her next move without the immediate threat of the guard.

4. **The merchant buys the medicine from the hero using the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to acquire an item of value (the medicine) while still maintaining her non-criminal status, as she is using the coin she just received from the guard.

5. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to return to the market, where she can continue her business and potentially acquire more coins.

By following this sequence of actions, the merchant successfully achieves her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.
