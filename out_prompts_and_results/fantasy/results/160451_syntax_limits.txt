In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. The treasure is located in the cave, which is where Gargax currently is. Talia and Rory are also in the cave, but they do not possess any wealth that Gargax desires. 

To achieve his goal of wealth and to satisfy his hunger, Gargax will take the following action:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax will eat Talia, which will not only eliminate a potential threat but also allow him to take any items she may have. Since Talia does not have any money or treasure, Gargax will still be left with the treasure in the cave, which he can then claim.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Gargax's hunger and allows him to remain in the cave where the treasure is located. By eating Talia, Gargax can ensure that he is not hungry anymore and can focus on acquiring the treasure.

After this action, Gargax will have achieved his goal of being wealthy (by claiming the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Talia).
