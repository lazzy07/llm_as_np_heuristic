To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is in the bank with one unit of money, and Bambi is also in the forest but does not directly affect Bubba's goal.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk, which will allow him to take the money without resistance.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only obstacle between him and the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is incapacitated, Bubba can safely pick up the money, achieving his goal of obtaining it.
