Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to approach the Lizard to communicate and find a way to ensure their mutual safety. She walks towards the Lizard, who is wary but curious about Zoe's intentions. Instead of fighting, Zoe extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together to escape the impending eruption. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's sincerity and sharing the same goal of safety, agrees to become friends.
