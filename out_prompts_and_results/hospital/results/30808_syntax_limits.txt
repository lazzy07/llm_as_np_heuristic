In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake when assessing or treating patients. Therefore, we will take actions that minimize the risk of error while ensuring Jones receives the correct treatment.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because identifying the correct symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the appropriate treatment. Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomC, Hathaway can assess him without needing to walk to another room.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is essential for Jones to achieve his goal of being healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to check on the other patients, ensuring that they are also being taken care of. This action is not directly related to Jones's health but is part of Hathaway's responsibility as a doctor.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to determine Jones's symptoms, which is necessary for providing the correct treatment.
2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to treat Jones based on the symptoms assessed. If treated correctly, Jones will become healthy.
3. **Walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)**: This action is taken to allow Hathaway to check on other patients, fulfilling her role as a doctor.
