**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realized he had to act quickly. He had the knife in his possession, and the bully was unaware of his intentions. 

Roy decided to take revenge on the bully. He approached the bully, who was distracted, and swiftly used the knife to kill him. With the bully out of the way, Roy felt a surge of relief. He then took a moment to catch his breath and think about his next move.

Now that the bully was dead, Roy could escape. He quickly put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself. With the gym door still locked, he crawled through the vent back to the hallway. Once in the hallway, he made his way to the highway, where he could finally escape from the prison.
