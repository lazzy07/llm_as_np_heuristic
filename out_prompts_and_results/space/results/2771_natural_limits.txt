Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to her spaceship for safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to his guardianship of the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, decides to confront Zoe at the surface.

As Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, the Lizard, now furious, walks to the surface to confront her. However, the volcano erupts just as Zoe arrives back at the spaceship, causing a catastrophic explosion that destroys the surface and kills Zoe.

In this story, the actions taken are necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and a character dies. The teleportation action is crucial as it leads to the confrontation and the eventual eruption. The Lizard's reaction to Zoe's teleportation is also essential, as it highlights the conflict between them, even though they are not fighting directly.
