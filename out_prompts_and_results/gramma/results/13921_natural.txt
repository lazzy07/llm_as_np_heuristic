The bandit, having just attacked the hero, sees an opportunity to further her goal of acquiring coins. She decides to loot the hero's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the hero might have had. Since the hero is dead, the bandit can loot without any risk of retaliation. 

Next, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the medicine and any coins she has acquired. The bandit is now at the camp, where she can keep her loot secure.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. The bandit loots the hero's corpse to take the medicine and any coins (if any were present).
2. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp to secure her loot.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
