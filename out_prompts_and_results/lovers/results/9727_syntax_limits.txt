In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex currently has the item (I1) that they want, but Blake does not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal, Blake needs to ensure that Alex is happy, which means Alex must have the item they want (I1). 

Since Alex is already happy with I1, Blake can simply give the item they have (I3) to Casey (C2), who wants I2. This will make Casey happy, and since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, they will be satisfied knowing that Alex is already happy.

Hereâ€™s the action Blake will take:

1. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Blake gives the item they have (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R12). This action makes Casey happy because they receive the item they want (I3).

This single action is sufficient for Blake to achieve their goal of making Alex happy, as Alex is already happy with I1.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: This action is necessary because it allows Blake to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which indirectly supports their goal of ensuring Alex is happy since Alex already has what they want.
