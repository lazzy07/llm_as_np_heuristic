Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to make peace with the Lizard instead of fighting. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends and work together to ensure their safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing the mutual threat posed by the volcano, agrees to become friends. 

As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, causing chaos on the surface. In the ensuing panic, Zoe and the Lizard manage to escape the immediate danger, but the eruption proves too powerful, and the Lizard is caught in the blast, leading to its demise. 

This sequence of actions is necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, a character dies, and two characters make friends. The initial action of making peace is crucial as it transforms their relationship from enemies to friends, which is a key requirement of the story. The eruption serves as the climactic event that fulfills the condition of a character dying.

(Note: The eruption and the Lizard's death are implied as a consequence of the situation rather than explicit actions taken by the characters.)
