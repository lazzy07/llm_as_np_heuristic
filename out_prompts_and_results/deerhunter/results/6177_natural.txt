To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, since he is hungry, he may want to eat Bambi, which is a dead animal, to satisfy his hunger. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry and wants to eat. This action is necessary for him to satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger.

After these actions, Bubba still has 1 money, which means he has achieved his goal. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and wants to eat something.
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action is taken because Bambi is available as food, and eating her will satisfy Bubba's hunger.
