Ernest, currently in the gym with the bully, realizes he is threatened and needs to act quickly. He decides to take revenge on the bully by using the knife he stole earlier. 

**Action: revenge(Ernest, Bully, Gym)**

This action is necessary because it allows Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring his safety and allowing him to keep the pack of cigarettes he previously stole. By killing the bully, Ernest can also secure a sense of control over his situation in the prison.

After successfully killing the bully, Ernest can now focus on his next steps without the fear of being threatened. 

**Ending:** Ernest is alive, no longer threatened, and can now enjoy the pack of cigarettes he desires.
