In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that they desire. 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Blake for the chocolates (I2) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry, while also ensuring that Blake is happy with the chocolates.

After this action, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted, and Blake is also happy because they received the chocolates.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry. Since both characters are in the same room (R21), they can trade items directly.
