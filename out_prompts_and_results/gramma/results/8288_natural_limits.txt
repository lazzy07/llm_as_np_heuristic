The merchant, seeing the bandit at the market, decides to take action to protect her interests. She knows that the bandit is a criminal and poses a threat to her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal herself. 

1. The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it brings the guard into the situation, who is motivated to eliminate criminals. By reporting the bandit, the merchant ensures that the guard will take action against the bandit, which will help her avoid any criminal entanglements while still pursuing her goal of acquiring coins.

2. The guard, upon receiving the report from the merchant, attacks and kills the bandit. This action removes the threat posed by the bandit, allowing the merchant to operate freely in the market without fear of robbery or violence.

With the bandit dead, the merchant can now safely collect coins from her transactions without the risk of being robbed or becoming involved in criminal activities.
