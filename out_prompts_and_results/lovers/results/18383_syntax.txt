To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to interact with them.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers. This is essential as Casey needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the flowers to Alex.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex receives the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
