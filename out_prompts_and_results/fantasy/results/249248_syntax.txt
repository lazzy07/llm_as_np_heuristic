To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions in the cave where the treasure is located. Since Talia is currently in the cave and has no wealth, she should pick up the treasure. This action will make her wealthy, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary because it directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

After this action, Talia will be wealthy, and since she is already married to Rory, she will also be happy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which fulfills her desire to be wealthy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures Talia achieves her goal of being both happy and wealthy in the shortest possible way.
