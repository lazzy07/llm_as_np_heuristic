Bubba is at the bank and wants to have money. The clerk has 1 money, and Bubba is hungry. To achieve his goal of getting money, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to intimidate the clerk and force him to give up his money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any potential confrontation with the clerk.

At this point, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of obtaining money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the rifle**: This is a critical step for Bubba to assert control over the situation and ensure he can take the money without resistance.
- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, which is his primary goal.
- **Going to the forest**: This action is a strategic move to remove himself from the bank after achieving his goal, ensuring he is not caught.
