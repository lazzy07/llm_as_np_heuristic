To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying the medicine. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This is where she can store her coins safely and fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that she has as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is necessary because the bandit needs to acquire coins, and Tom is an easy target since he is unarmed and has a coin.
- **Walking to the Camp**: The bandit needs to move to a safe location where she can keep her coins without the threat of being attacked by the guard.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in her possession.
