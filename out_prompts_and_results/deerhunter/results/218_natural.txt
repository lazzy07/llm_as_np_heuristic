To achieve Bubba's goal of having 0 money, he needs to ensure that he does not acquire any money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba already has 0 money and does not want to change that, he can simply choose to go back to the house, where he believes the rifle and ammunition are located, and stay there without interacting with the bank clerk.
