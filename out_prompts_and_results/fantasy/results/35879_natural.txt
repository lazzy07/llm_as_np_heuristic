To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia and Rory are at the cave, and Gargax is hungry. The treasure is at the cave, and Vince has the money at the village. 

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax is hungry and wants to eat Rory, who is at the cave. This action will remove Rory from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her goals without Rory's influence.
   
2. **Talia picks up the treasure**: After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can now pick up the treasure that is at the cave. This action will make Talia wealthy, as she now possesses the treasure.

3. **Talia becomes happy**: Since Talia has achieved her goal of becoming wealthy by picking up the treasure, she is now happy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia becomes wealthy and happy, fulfilling her desires.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary to eliminate Rory, who is a potential competitor for Talia's happiness and wealth. With Rory gone, Talia can focus on her own goals.
- **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, as the treasure is a valuable item.
- **Talia becomes happy**: This is the result of Talia achieving her goal of wealth through the treasure.
