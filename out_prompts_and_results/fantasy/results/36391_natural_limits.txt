In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are all present. Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but her happiness is at 0. Vince has the money, and the treasure is also in the cave. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth.

To achieve Talia's happiness, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince has, which will make Gargax wealthy. Since Vince is married to Talia, this action will also lead to Talia's unhappiness, but it will set the stage for the next action.

2. **Gargax gives the treasure to Talia**: After eating Vince, Gargax, now wealthy, can choose to give the treasure to Talia. This action will make Talia wealthy, which is one of her goals. Since Talia is now wealthy, she will also feel a sense of happiness from achieving her goal of wealth.

By completing these two actions, Talia will become wealthy, which fulfills her desire for wealth and indirectly contributes to her happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is crucial for Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth. It also removes Vince from the equation, allowing Talia to focus on her own desires.
- **Gargax gives the treasure to Talia**: This action directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, which is essential for her happiness.
