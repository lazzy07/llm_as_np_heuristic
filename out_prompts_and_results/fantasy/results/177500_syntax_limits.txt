In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Given the current situation, Rory has already accepted Talia's marriage proposal, which makes them happy. However, Rory is not wealthy yet, as he has no treasure or money. The quickest way for Rory to achieve his goal is to take the money from Vince, who is currently in the village with the money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the village to confront Vince and take the money.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince, which makes him wealthy.

Now, Rory is happy (due to the marriage acceptance), wealthy (after taking the money), and not hungry (as he has not become hungry). 

The story is complete with these two actions, as they directly lead to Rory achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Rory to reach Vince, who has the money. Without this action, Rory cannot take the money.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Rory to acquire the money, fulfilling his goal of becoming wealthy.
