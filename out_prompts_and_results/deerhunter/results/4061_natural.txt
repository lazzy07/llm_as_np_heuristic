To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants the money, and the clerk is the only one who has it. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money without any resistance.
   
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action is the execution of the previous decision. It ensures that the clerk is dead, allowing Bubba to take the money without any threat.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After the clerk is dead, Bubba can now take the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money, and Bambi remains alive, which is acceptable since the primary goal was for Bubba to have the money.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** - Bubba wants money, and the clerk has it. This decision is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal.
   
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action directly leads to the clerk's death, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - With the clerk dead, Bubba can now take the money, achieving his goal.
