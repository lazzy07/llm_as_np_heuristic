To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to threaten the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken to eliminate the clerk as a threat and to take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome. The first action prepares Bubba for the confrontation, the second action removes the clerk from the equation, and the third action allows Bubba to acquire the money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
