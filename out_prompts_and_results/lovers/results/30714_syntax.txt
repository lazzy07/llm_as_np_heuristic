To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any room, but we know that I1 (the flowers) is with Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R11)**: Casey moves from the living room to the dining room where Alex and Casey are currently located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.
   
2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R11)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Blake (C2) in the dining room. This is important because it allows Blake to have an item, which is a step towards their happiness.

3. **move(C2, R11, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room where Casey is currently located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Casey and potentially trade items.

4. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers (I1) they received from Casey for the jewelry (I2) that Casey has. This is the crucial action that allows Blake to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **move(C3, R22, R11)**: Casey moves back to the dining room after the trade. This action is not necessary for Blake's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry (I2), which makes them happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R11)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to give them the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R11)**: This action allows Blake to receive an item, which is necessary for their happiness.
- **move(C2, R11, R22)**: Blake needs to move to the living room to interact with Casey for the trade.
- **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Blake to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **move(C3, R22, R11)**: This action is for narrative continuity and does not affect Blake's happiness.
