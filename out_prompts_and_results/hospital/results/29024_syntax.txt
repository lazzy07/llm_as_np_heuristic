To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomC to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young's symptoms are currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room and assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Jones's symptoms are also currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to know how to treat Jones.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both Young and Jones, ensuring that all patients are healthy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, Admissions)",
