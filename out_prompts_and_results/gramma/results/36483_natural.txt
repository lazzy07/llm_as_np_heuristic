The bandit, having just attacked and looted the medicine from the merchant, sees the guard armed and ready. However, the bandit is determined to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She decides to take a calculated risk.

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the guard, who poses a threat to her freedom and ability to carry coins. The bandit believes she can overpower the guard since she is armed.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's sword.** After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit loots the sword from the guard's corpse. This action is necessary for the bandit to ensure she is better equipped for any future confrontations and to solidify her status as a criminal.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** With the medicine and now the guard's sword, the bandit heads back to her camp. This action is crucial as it allows her to secure her loot and potentially store the medicine and any coins she may acquire.

4. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action is taken to ensure that the medicine is safe and that she can use it later or trade it for more coins.

5. **The bandit retrieves the coins from the chest.** Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

By following these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins and securing the medicine.
