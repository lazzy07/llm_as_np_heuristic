To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine their symptoms. This is essential because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will assume that Hathaway correctly identifies the symptoms.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats them with the appropriate treatment based on the identified symptoms. If Jones has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is critical for Jones to recover and achieve their goal of being healthy.

By following these steps, Jones will be treated correctly and will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
