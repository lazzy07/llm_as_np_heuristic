Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment. With a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she knows that she must act quickly to help the patients.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, specifically Jones, Ross, and Young.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Jones to Patient Room A, Dr. Hathaway can then assess him for symptoms. This action also reduces her workload to 2.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - This allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross next. Her workload is now 3 again, but she can still assess the patients without making a mistake.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Young as well. Her workload remains at 3, but she is now ready to assess all patients.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. She then treats him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. She treats him with steroids, making him healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and finds he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. She treats him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

By the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
