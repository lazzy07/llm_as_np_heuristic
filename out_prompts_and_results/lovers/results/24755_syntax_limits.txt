In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want item I2, which is currently unaccounted for. To achieve their goal of happiness, Blake needs to acquire I2. Since Alex (C1) is aware of Blake's desire for I2, Blake can ask Alex to help them obtain it.

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that they want item I2, which is necessary for Alex to understand Blake's desire and potentially help them.

This action is crucial because it opens the communication between Blake and Alex, allowing Alex to take further actions to help Blake achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation remains unchanged in terms of item locations, but it sets the stage for future actions where Alex can either find I2 or help Blake in another way.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is minimal and directly addresses Blake's goal of achieving happiness by expressing their desire for the item they want.
