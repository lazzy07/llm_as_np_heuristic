Zoe and the Lizard find themselves in the cave, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano on the surface. To achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends, they need to establish a positive relationship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe initiates a conversation with the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to ensure their safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and being safe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they explore the surface together to find a safer location away from the volcano. This action is necessary to move to a safer area while maintaining their newfound friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe to the surface. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures they are both moving towards safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: As they reach the surface, the volcano erupts. However, since they are now friends and have worked together, they can help each other find shelter quickly.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard quickly return to the cave, which provides them safety from the eruption. This action is essential to ensure both characters remain healthy and safe.

By making peace and working together, Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of friendship and safety, even in the face of danger.
