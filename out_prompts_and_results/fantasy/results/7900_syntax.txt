To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Propose**: Rory will propose to Talia. This is necessary because Rory wants to be happy, and marrying Talia will fulfill that desire.
2. **Accept**: Talia will accept Rory's proposal. This is essential for both characters to achieve happiness through marriage.
3. **Marry**: Rory and Talia will get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures both characters are happy.
4. **Travel**: Rory will travel from the Cave to the Village. This is necessary for Rory to be in the same location as Gargax, who is currently in the Village.
5. **Eat**: Gargax will eat Talia. This action is included because it will remove Talia from the story, allowing Rory to be the only human left, which is a necessary condition for Rory to be wealthy and not hungry.
6. **Take**: Rory will take the Money from Talia's dead body. This is crucial for Rory to achieve wealth, as he needs to acquire the money that Talia had.
7. **Get Hungry**: Rory will become hungry. This is included to fulfill the condition of Rory being not hungry after the next action.
8. **Eat**: Gargax will eat Rory. This action is included because it will remove Rory from the story, allowing Gargax to achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goal of being wealthy (by acquiring the money) and happy (through marriage), even though he will not be alive at the end.
