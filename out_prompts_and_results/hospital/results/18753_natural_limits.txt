Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. Since both Jones and Ross are in the admissions room, Hathaway admits them to exam room B and exam room A, respectively. 

1. **Action: Admit Jones to Exam Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the appropriate care. By admitting him, Hathaway can later assess his condition.

2. **Action: Admit Ross to Exam Room A.**  
   - Similar to Jones, admitting Ross allows Hathaway to provide him with the necessary treatment. 

3. **Action: Assess Young in Exam Room C.**  
   - Since Young is already in Exam Room C, Hathaway assesses him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

After assessing Young, Hathaway realizes that Young has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. 

Now, Hathaway can proceed to assess and treat Jones and Ross in their respective exam rooms, ensuring all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Admitting Jones and Ross allows Hathaway to manage their care effectively.
- Assessing Young is essential to identify his condition and provide the correct treatment.
