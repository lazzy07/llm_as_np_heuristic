To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, they can get married, which will make Talia happy. Additionally, Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located, and she can pick it up to increase her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.
2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village where Rory is located. This is necessary for the next action, which is to get married.
3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is crucial because it allows Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her primary goals. 
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia needs to return to the village to be with Rory, as they cannot get married unless they are in the same location.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness, as she has accepted Rory's proposal, and marriage will make them both happy.

By completing these actions, Talia will achieve her goal of happiness through marriage and also increase her wealth by picking up the treasure.
