Zoe, having just made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano's imminent eruption. She decides to take action to ensure both her and the Lizard's safety. 

1. **Erupt the volcano on the surface**: Zoe knows that the volcano is about to erupt and that it poses a threat to the Lizard, who is currently on the surface. By causing the volcano to erupt, she can create a situation that forces the Lizard to seek safety, which may lead to a stronger bond between them as they navigate the danger together.

2. **Walk to the surface**: After the eruption, Zoe walks to the surface to check on the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows her to be present during the eruption and to potentially help the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship.

3. **Make peace with the Lizard**: Once on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard in distress due to the eruption. She reassures the Lizard, and they both realize that they need each other to survive. This leads them to become friends, solidifying their relationship.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard being in danger, and Zoe and the Lizard making friends as they work together to survive the eruption.
