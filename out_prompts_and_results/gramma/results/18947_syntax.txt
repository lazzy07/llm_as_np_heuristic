To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently in the Market and has one coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coin she just acquired from Tom and place it in the chest. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully stored her coins.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: This action allows the Bandit to acquire a coin from Tom, which is essential for her goal of accumulating coins.
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can secure her coins.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action finalizes the Bandit's goal by ensuring her coins are safely stored in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
