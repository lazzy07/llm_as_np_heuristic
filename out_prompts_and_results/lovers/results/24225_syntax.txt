To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is necessary for Alex to be with the other characters after obtaining the flowers.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is important because it allows Alex to make Casey happy, which is also part of Alex's goal.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to check on the chocolates. This action is not directly related to Alex's goal but helps maintain the flow of the story.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This is necessary for Blake to achieve their own happiness.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room with the chocolates. This keeps the characters together.

8. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex. This action helps ensure that Alex is happy as well.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and the chocolates, making them happy.
