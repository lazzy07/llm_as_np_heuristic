**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, but he also has the knife. He quickly moves to the gym, where he finds the bully alone, focused on his workout.

1. **Ernest locks the gym door.** This action ensures that the bully cannot escape and that no one can interrupt their confrontation. It also gives Ernest a sense of control over the situation.

2. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully. With the bully dead, Ernest no longer has to worry about being threatened or killed.

3. **Ernest escapes through the hallway to the highway.** After killing the bully, Ernest quickly leaves the gym, knowing that he needs to get out of the prison before anyone discovers what happened.

4. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes on the highway.** This final action allows Ernest to fully disguise himself, making it easier to blend in and escape from the prison without being recognized.
