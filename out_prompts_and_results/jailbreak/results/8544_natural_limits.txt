**Story Completion:**

On day one, after completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest decides to take a risk. He knows the knife is in the kitchen, and the bully is in the gym, but he also knows that both he and Roy are threatened. To ensure their safety and to eliminate the bully, Ernest quickly grabs the knife from the kitchen.

With the knife in hand, Ernest moves to the hallway, where he can access the gym. He locks the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. With the bully now unable to escape, Ernest confronts him and, in a moment of desperation and survival, kills the bully with the knife.
