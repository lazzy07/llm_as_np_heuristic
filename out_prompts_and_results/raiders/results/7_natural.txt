2. **Indiana Jones digs up the Ark.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Indiana can take the Ark away from the U.S. Army, as he believes it is too dangerous to be in their hands.

3. **Indiana Jones travels from Tanis to the USA with the Ark.**  
   - This action allows Indiana to return to the U.S. with the Ark, where he can ensure it is kept safe.

4. **Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the U.S. Army.**  
   - By giving the Ark to the U.S. Army, Indiana can convince them to keep it secure and prevent the Nazis from getting it. He believes that the U.S. Army will take the necessary precautions.

5. **The U.S. Army opens the Ark.**  
   - This action is included because Indiana knows the Ark is dangerous. He hopes that the U.S. Army will realize the threat and take action to secure it, leading to the Ark's destruction or containment.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Indiana Jones achieves his goal of keeping the Ark out of the hands of the Nazis and ensuring it is not misused by the U.S. Army. By traveling to Tanis, he confronts the threat directly. Digging up the Ark allows him to take control of it, and returning to the U.S. with it gives him the opportunity to hand it over to the Army, where he can advocate for its safety. The final action of opening the Ark is a gamble, but it is necessary to ensure that the Ark's dangerous nature is revealed.
