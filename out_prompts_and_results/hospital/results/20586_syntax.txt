To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing Ross's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Young from Admissions to PatientRoomC**: Young is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room. Since Ross is already in PatientRoomC, Hathaway can walk Young there to assess him next.

4. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After walking Young to PatientRoomC, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both Ross and Young, ensuring that all patients are healthy.
