Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to reach out to the Lizard, who is still on the surface. She expresses her desire to be friends and work together to stay safe from the impending eruption. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to improve their relationship.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe and the Lizard are making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption proves too powerful for the Lizard, who is unable to escape in time. This action results in the Lizard's death, which is a critical part of the story's conclusion.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard, but the eruption ultimately leads to the Lizard's demise. The story ends with the volcano erupting and the Lizard dying, while Zoe's intention to make friends is acknowledged.
