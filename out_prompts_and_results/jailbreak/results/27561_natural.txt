**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, feeling the pressure of the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that they need to secure their safety. 

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym without being threatened directly by the bully.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Roy ensures that the bully cannot escape and that they can confront him safely.)
3. **Roy goes back to the kitchen.** (Roy returns to the kitchen to regroup with Ernest and plan their next move.)
4. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is crucial as it gives Roy a means to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
5. **Roy returns to the hallway.** (Roy needs to be in the hallway to access the gym again.)
6. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
7. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Roy and Ernest's safety.)

With the bully dead, Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened. They can now focus on their escape.

8. **Roy goes to the hallway.** (Roy needs to regroup with Ernest.)
9. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises Roy, allowing him to escape without being recognized.)
10. **Roy goes to the highway.** (This is the final step to reach freedom.)
11. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise, Roy successfully leaves the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at eliminating the threat of the bully and securing their escape. The locking of the gym door prevents the bully from retaliating, while the knife provides a means to kill the bully. The final actions focus on disguising and escaping, which are essential for achieving Ernest's goal of being alive and free.
