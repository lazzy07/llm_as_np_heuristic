To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex (C1) will trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up earlier with Blake (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Blake has. This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I3) and will also be happy since they want Alex to be happy.

The final state will be:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex has I1)
- happy(C2) = False (Casey still does not have what they want)
- happy(C3) = True (Blake has I3)

This satisfies Alex's goal of being happy.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
``` 

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: This action allows Alex to exchange the chocolates they have for the jewelry that Blake possesses. Since Alex's goal is to be happy by obtaining the jewelry, this trade directly fulfills that need.
