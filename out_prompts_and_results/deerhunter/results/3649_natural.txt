To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential target for food.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - Since Bubba is hungry, he needs to eat. Shooting Bambi will provide him with food, and since Bambi is alive, this action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer. This action will satisfy his hunger, allowing him to focus on his goal of obtaining money afterward.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba needs to return to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and obtain the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of having 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger first, which is crucial for him to be able to think clearly and act effectively to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
