Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, solidifying their friendship. However, the ground begins to tremble, and the volcano shows signs of erupting. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the volcano is about to erupt. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are now friends, and Zoe's priority is to avoid danger.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs after Zoe has teleported to the spaceship, ensuring that she is safe. The eruption is a natural consequence of the situation on the surface.

3. **The Lizard, remaining on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies.** - This action concludes the story with the Lizard's demise, highlighting the danger of the surface and the consequences of the volcanic eruption.

In this story, the actions taken are necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe escapes to safety. The friendship between Zoe and the Lizard is established before the eruption, emphasizing the bond they formed despite the tragic outcome.
