To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the guard is armed and poses a threat to the bandit. By eliminating the guard, the bandit can secure her position and avoid being reported or attacked.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.** After defeating the guard, the bandit can take the guard's sword and any coins the guard may have had. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying more coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store her newly acquired coins and weapons safely.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at her camp.
