To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room. This is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This is important for social interaction and to ensure that Alex can share their happiness.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to make Casey happy, which is also part of Alex's goal.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Alex and Blake. This is necessary for Casey to be in a place where they can enjoy their happiness.

6. **give(C3, I1, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I1) to Blake. This action ensures that Blake is happy, fulfilling Casey's desire to make Blake happy.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey. This is important for the social aspect of their happiness.

8. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I3) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex is happy, as they now have the item they wanted.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry, Casey is happy because they received the jewelry from Alex, and Blake is happy because they received chocolates from Casey.
