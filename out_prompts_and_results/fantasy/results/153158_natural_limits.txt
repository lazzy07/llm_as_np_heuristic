To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.** 

This action is necessary because Talia needs to return to the village where Rory is located. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness can be achieved by being with Rory, who also desires happiness. By traveling to the village, Talia can be with Rory, fulfilling her need for happiness. 

After this action, Talia will be in the village, where she can enjoy her relationships and feel happy, while also retaining her wealth from the treasure she picked up earlier.
