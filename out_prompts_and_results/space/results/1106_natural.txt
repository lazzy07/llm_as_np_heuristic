Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** This action is taken to seek shelter from the impending eruption, as the cave offers a safer environment compared to the surface.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, recognizing that safety is paramount for both of them. This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of staying safe.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs after both characters have reached the cave, ensuring they are safe from the eruption. 

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they are already friends, this action solidifies their bond and emphasizes their shared goal of safety and friendship.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
