Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, assesses Young, who is experiencing a fever. Given that Young has a fever, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Flaze. However, due to Hathaway's workload being 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure Young receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Young immediately with antibiotics, which is the appropriate treatment for Flaze. 

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Young becomes healthy. This action fulfills Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross, who is still in Admissions. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated as well, but it is not part of the immediate goal of making Young healthy.

The story concludes with Young being healthy, which is the primary goal of Dr. Hathaway.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and identify the correct disease (Flaze).
