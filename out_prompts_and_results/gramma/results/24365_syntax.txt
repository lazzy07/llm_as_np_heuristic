To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to head towards the crossroads, which is the only path available to reach the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom will continue on the path to the cottage, where he wants to be.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage while carrying the medicine he obtained from the merchant. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's goal, as they are either focused on their own objectives or are not in a position to act against him.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- The first action is necessary for Tom to leave the market and head towards the crossroads, which is a required step to reach the cottage.
- The second action is necessary for Tom to finally arrive at the cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:
