Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, establishing a friendly relationship. To ensure their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave, seeking shelter from the impending eruption. This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safe place away from the volcano.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is crucial as it ensures that both characters are together in a safe location, reinforcing their friendship and mutual goal of safety.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now safely in the cave, they avoid the danger. This action demonstrates the consequence of their previous actions, highlighting the importance of their decision to seek shelter together.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
