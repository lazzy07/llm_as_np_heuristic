To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow a straightforward path. Here’s the completed story:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba goes to the forest to find Bambi. He then decides to eat Bambi, which fulfills his hunger and also results in Bambi being dead. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome. Bubba ends up with the money from the bank after shooting the clerk, and Bambi is dead after Bubba eats her.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
