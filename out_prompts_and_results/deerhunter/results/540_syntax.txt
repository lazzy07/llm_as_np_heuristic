To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is hungry and wants to eat, but he also has greed for money. Loading the rifle with ammunition prepares him for a potential confrontation with the bank clerk, which is necessary for him to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After loading the rifle, Bubba can shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can steal the money. This action directly satisfies Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but provides a logical conclusion to his actions after acquiring the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba takes the money from the now-dead clerk.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba exits the bank, concluding his actions.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
