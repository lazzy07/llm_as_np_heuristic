To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, rifle in hand, feeling a sense of accomplishment. He has successfully stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and shot Bambi, which has left him with a sense of power. He checks his pockets and confirms that he has 1 money. Satisfied with his haul, he decides to rest in the forest, enjoying the quiet and the thrill of his recent actions. He knows he has achieved what he set out to do.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba stands in the forest** - This establishes Bubba's location and state of mind.
2. **Bubba checks his pockets** - This action confirms that he has achieved his goal of having 1 money.
3. **Bubba decides to rest** - This shows that Bubba is content with his situation and does not need to take further actions.
