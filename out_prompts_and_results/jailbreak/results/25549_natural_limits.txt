**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the hallway, he knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming out and threatening them. 

After locking the gym door, Roy feels a sense of relief knowing that the bully is trapped inside. He then crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Once disguised, he makes his way to the highway outside the prison, successfully escaping.
