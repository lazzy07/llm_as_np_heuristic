In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1), which is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to obtain the jewelry. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve that:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to get the item they want (I1) while also ensuring that Casey (C3) is happy with the chocolates (I3).

The action sequence is as follows:

- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I3) with Casey for the jewelry (I1) in the living room (R22).

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they now have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) is happy because they received the chocolates (I3).

Blake (C2) remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

### Explanation of the action:
