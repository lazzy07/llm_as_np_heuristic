**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Young is showing a rash, correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they are at risk of making a mistake, but they proceed to treat Young for Jarkis with steroids, which is the correct treatment. Young receives the treatment and becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is in Patient Room B. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 2, they can accurately assess Ross. However, since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease. To ensure that Ross is treated, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Unfortunately, this incorrect treatment leads to Ross's demise.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones. With a workload of 2, Dr. Hathaway can accurately assess Jones. Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. This incorrect treatment also leads to Jones's demise.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Ross and Jones, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young, achieving their goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
