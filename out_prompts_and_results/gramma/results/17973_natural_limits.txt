The bandit, having just robbed the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the chaos at the market. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she sees the guard and the hero. The bandit knows that the guard is armed and poses a threat, but she also knows that the hero is unarmed and vulnerable. 

The bandit approaches the hero and, with her sword drawn, she threatens him. The hero, feeling intimidated and realizing he is outmatched, hands over his remaining coin to the bandit. With this action, the bandit successfully increases her coin collection without needing to engage in further violence.

Now, with both the hero's coin and her own coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the hero and the guard, as she needs to be in the same location to achieve her goal.
2. **Bandit threatens the hero**: This action allows the bandit to intimidate the hero into giving up his coin, which is essential for her to increase her coin collection.
