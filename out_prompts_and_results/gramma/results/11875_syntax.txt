To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Rob the Bandit**: The Merchant will rob the Bandit to take the BanditCoin. This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to increase her coin count without spending any of her own coins, and the Bandit is not armed with a sword, making her vulnerable to robbery.

2. **Walk to the Market**: After robbing the Bandit, the Merchant will walk to the Market. This is necessary for her to be in her preferred location where she can sell her items or trade.

3. **Buy an Item (if applicable)**: If the Merchant has enough coins after the robbery, she can buy an item from herself or trade with another character. However, since the goal is to maximize coins, this action may not be necessary unless it directly contributes to her goal.

4. **Walk to the Crossroads**: The Merchant will then walk back to the Crossroads to ensure she is in a position to interact with Tom or the Bandit again if needed.

5. **Report the Bandit**: The Merchant can report the Bandit to the Guard, which will lead to the Bandit being killed. This action is crucial because it removes a criminal from the area, allowing the Merchant to operate freely without the threat of being robbed or attacked.

6. **Loot the Bandit**: After the Bandit is killed, the Merchant can loot the Bandit for any remaining coins or items. This will further increase her coin count.

7. **Return to the Market**: Finally, the Merchant will walk back to the Market to finalize her transactions and ensure she is in her preferred location.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)
2. walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)
