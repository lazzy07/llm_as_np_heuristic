To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, we need to ensure that he can acquire the medicine from the merchant without being hindered by the bandit or the guard. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the merchant and acquire the medicine.

2. **Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using one of his coins.**  
   - This action allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires.

3. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.**  
   - After acquiring the medicine, Tom needs to return to the Crossroads to head back to the cottage.

4. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**  
   - This final action takes Tom to his desired location, the cottage, with the medicine in hand.

The actions are structured to ensure that Tom can successfully navigate to the merchant, acquire the medicine, and return to the cottage without any interference from the bandit or the guard.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)",
    "buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
