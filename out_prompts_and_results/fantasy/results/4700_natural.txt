To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage and the acquisition of wealth through treasure. Here’s the completed story:

1. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.** (This action is necessary because it leads to Talia's happiness. Since Rory has already proposed, accepting the proposal will make both characters happy.)
   
2. **Rory and Talia get married.** (This action solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness, as marriage is a significant event that contributes to her emotional state.)

3. **Talia picks up the treasure.** (This action is essential for Talia to become wealthy. Since the treasure is at the cave, and Talia is already there, she can pick it up.)

4. **Gargax eats Rory.** (This action is included to remove a character who is not contributing to Talia's goals. Rory's death will not affect Talia's happiness since she is already married to him, and it will allow Gargax to satisfy his hunger.)

5. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (This action is necessary for Gargax to become wealthy, but it also ensures that Vince is no longer a threat to Talia's goals.)

At the end of these actions, Talia is married to Rory, which makes her happy, and she has picked up the treasure, making her wealthy. 

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **Accepting the proposal and getting married** ensures Talia's happiness.
- **Picking up the treasure** directly contributes to Talia's wealth.
- **Eating Rory and taking money from Vince** are actions that remove obstacles and ensure that Gargax can fulfill his own goals without affecting Talia's happiness and wealth.
