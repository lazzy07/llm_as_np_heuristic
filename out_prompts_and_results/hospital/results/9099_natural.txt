**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) to assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to determine what symptoms Jones is experiencing, which is currently unknown.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similar to the previous action, this is necessary to find out Ross's symptoms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - This completes the assessment of all patients in the admissions room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to gather the necessary information to treat them.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can now assign him to an exam room for treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever (symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**  
   - After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway assigns him to an exam room for treatment.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), this treatment will make him healthy.

9. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway assigns him to an exam room for treatment.

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
    - Assuming Young has a fever (symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to assess and treat the patients based on their symptoms, which is essential for achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
