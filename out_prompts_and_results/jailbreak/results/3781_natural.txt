**Story Completion:**

Ernest and Roy are in the laundry room, feeling the tension from the bully's threats. They know they need to act quickly to ensure their survival. 

1. **Ernest gives the knife to Roy.** (This action is necessary because it allows Roy to have a weapon to defend themselves against the bully if needed.)
   
2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action is crucial as it disguises Roy, allowing him to escape later if the situation escalates.)

3. **Ernest and Roy move to the hallway.** (They need to leave the laundry room to avoid being cornered by the bully.)

4. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to access the gym without being seen by the bully, giving him a chance to confront him.)

5. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This is a strategic move to prevent the bully from escaping once he confronts him.)

6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is necessary for Roy to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Ernest are safe.)

7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (Now that the bully is dealt with, Roy can disguise himself for the escape.)

8. **Roy crawls back through the vents to the hallway.** (This allows him to return to Ernest without being seen.)

9. **Ernest and Roy escape to the highway.** (This final action is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that both Ernest and Roy can survive the bully's threats and ultimately escape the prison. The transfer of the knife and the disguise are critical for their safety and successful escape.
