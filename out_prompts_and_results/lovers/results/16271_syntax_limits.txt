In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the chocolates (I3). 

Given the current situation, Blake can take the following action:

1. **trade(Blake, I3, Alex, I1, R21)**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up from the dining room with Alex for the jewelry (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the item they want, thus making Alex happy. Since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, this trade directly fulfills that objective.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the jewelry (I1) and will also be happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
