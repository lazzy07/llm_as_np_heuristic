To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has 1 money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)
