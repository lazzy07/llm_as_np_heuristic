Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, realizes that both Jones and Ross are still in the admissions room and need to be assigned to exam rooms for assessment. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake, so she decides to prioritize assessing Young first, who is already assigned to Patient Room B.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Since Young is in Patient Room B, Hathaway can assess him without increasing her workload further. This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to identify Young's condition.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway determines that he has Jarkis due to the rash that she identifies during the assessment. She treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room A**: After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room and admits Ross to Patient Room A. This action is essential to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room for further assessment and treatment.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and ensures that Ross is on the path to being assessed and treated as well, achieving her goal of having all patients healthy.
