**Story Completion:**

The bandit, realizing that the merchant has the medicine and the hero's coin, decides to take action. She walks from the camp to the crossroads, where she encounters the hero. The bandit, armed with her sword, sees that the hero is also armed but believes she can outsmart him. 

1. The bandit approaches the hero and, using her sword, she attempts to rob him. Since the hero is not carrying any coins, she cannot take anything from him. However, she notices that the hero is distracted by her presence.
   
2. The bandit then quickly walks back to the camp, where she knows the merchant is still present. She confronts the merchant and, using her sword, she threatens her to hand over the medicine and the hero's coin. The merchant, fearing for her life, complies and gives the bandit the medicine and the coin.

3. With the medicine and the coin in her possession, the bandit walks back to the camp, satisfied that she has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can and having the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Robbing the Hero:** The bandit attempts to rob the hero to gain coins, but since the hero has none, this action serves to distract the hero and create an opportunity for the bandit to move on to her next target, the merchant.

2. **Threatening the Merchant:** This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to achieve her goal of obtaining the medicine and the hero's coin without killing anyone, thus avoiding the attention of the guard.

3. **Returning to the Camp:** This final action solidifies the bandit's success in achieving her goal, as she now possesses both the medicine and the coins.
