To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Young as well. This is important to ensure that both patients in Exam Room A are evaluated for their symptoms.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

4. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for identifying his condition and providing the appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and well-being.
