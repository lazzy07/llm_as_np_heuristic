The merchant, realizing the danger posed by the bandit, decides to take action to protect herself and her goods. She quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is also at the market. The guard, upon receiving this information, immediately confronts the bandit and attacks her, successfully killing the criminal. With the bandit out of the way, the merchant can now safely collect the coins from the hero's corpse, achieving her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal.
