To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is currently at the Market and needs to move to the Crossroads to access the path to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to position herself for the next steps.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After reaching the Crossroads, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This is essential for her to access the chest where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action directly fulfills her goal of having as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully moves to the Bandit Camp and takes the coins, achieving her goal without any conflict or unnecessary actions.
