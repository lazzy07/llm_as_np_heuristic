To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and has assessed Young, they need to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Jones is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet. 

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, if he is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway can treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, Admissions)**: After assessing Jones and confirming he has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats both Young and Jones, ensuring that all patients are healthy.
