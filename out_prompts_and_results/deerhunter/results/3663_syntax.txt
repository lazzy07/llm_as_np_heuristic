To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also there. Bubba is greedy and hungry, and he has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk has some money, which Bubba desires.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, having a loaded rifle, can steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is included to move Bubba away from the bank after committing the theft.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is already dead from the previous shooting, Bubba can eat Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a logical step since he is now in the forest where Bambi's body is located.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money from the bank clerk and will have eaten Bambi, fulfilling the conditions of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires without further violence, as he already has a loaded gun.
- **go**: Moving to the forest after the theft helps Bubba avoid any potential consequences from the bank clerk.
- **eat**: This action addresses Bubba's hunger and utilizes the dead Bambi, which is a logical outcome of the previous shooting.
