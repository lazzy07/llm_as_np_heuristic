To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, we can outline the following actions:

1. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be in a position to interact with Alex and Casey, as he needs to communicate about the chocolates.

2. **Blake tells Alex that Casey wants the flowers.**  
   - Blake lies to Alex about Casey's desire, which is a strategic move to mislead Alex and create a situation where Alex might give away the jewelry.

3. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - Since Alex believes that Casey wants the flowers, and Blake has misled him, Alex will give the jewelry to Casey, thinking it will make Casey happy.

4. **Casey is now happy.**  
   - With the jewelry in hand, Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Blake moves to the living room to create a connection with Alex.
2. Blake lies to Alex about Casey's desires, which influences Alex's decision.
3. Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's goal.
