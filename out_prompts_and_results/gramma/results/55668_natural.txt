To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location where she can store her coins.

2. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The story is short because the bandit has already successfully robbed the hero and looted the medicine from the merchant. The only remaining action needed to fulfill her goal is to secure the coin in her chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This is essential for the bandit to access her stash and fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.
- **Placing the coin in the chest**: This directly achieves the bandit's goal of having coins stored safely.
