To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, where the clerk has money. Bubba is also hungry, which may influence his actions. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken to eliminate the threat from the clerk and to take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Although Bubba is hungry, he has achieved his goal of getting money. This action indicates that he may consider eating later, but it is not necessary for achieving his primary goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to take control of the situation.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Indicates Bubba's hunger but is not essential for the goal.
