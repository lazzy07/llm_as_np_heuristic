To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **Bubba sees Bambi in the forest.** Since Bubba is hungry, he decides to shoot Bambi to eat her. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is a priority before he can focus on his greed for money.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** This action is taken because Bubba needs food to survive, and Bambi is a potential source of food.

3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat her to satisfy his hunger. This is crucial for Bubba's survival and allows him to continue pursuing his goal of getting money.

4. **Bubba then decides to go back to the bank.** After eating, Bubba is now in a better position to think about his greed and the money he desires.

5. **Bubba goes to the bank.** This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

6. **Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
