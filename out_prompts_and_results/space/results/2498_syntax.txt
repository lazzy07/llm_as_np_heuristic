To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard interact in a way that leads to them becoming friends while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, resulting in one character dying. The goal is to create a scenario where they can bond over a shared experience, but the eruption will ultimately lead to a tragic end for one of them.

1. **Zoe walks to the Cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends. 
2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action signifies that Zoe and the Lizard are putting aside any differences and are willing to be friends. This is crucial for achieving their goal of making friends.
3. **The volcano erupts**: This action will lead to the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe moves to the Cave where the Lizard is located.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard become friends, achieving their goal of friendship.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to a dangerous situation.

Since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she will die as a result of the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the Cave**: This is necessary for Zoe to meet the Lizard and initiate a friendship.
- **Making Peace**: This action is essential to fulfill the goal of both characters wanting to make friends.
- **Erupting the Volcano**: This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying, which adds a tragic element to the story.
