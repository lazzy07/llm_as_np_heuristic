In the cave, Gargax is feeling increasingly hungry and desires wealth. Talia and Rory are present, but they are unaware of Gargax's intentions. 

1. Gargax eats Rory. This action is taken because Gargax is hungry and Rory is a human present in the cave. By eating Rory, Gargax not only satisfies his hunger but also eliminates a potential obstacle to obtaining the treasure.
