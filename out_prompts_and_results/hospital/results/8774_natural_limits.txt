Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B, increasing their workload to 3. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room B, discovering that Jones has a fever, indicating Flaze.
