To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary because Gargax needs to be at the location of the treasure to acquire it.

2. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia, who is at the cave. This action is taken because Gargax is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. Eating Talia also eliminates her from the story, allowing Gargax to take the treasure without any opposition.

3. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth, as the treasure is the item that will make Gargax wealthy.

After these actions, Gargax will have satisfied their hunger by eating Talia and will have acquired the treasure, thus achieving their goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
