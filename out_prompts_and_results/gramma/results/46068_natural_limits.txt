Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads, where he spots the bandit. Knowing that the bandit is a criminal, Tom decides to report the bandit's location to the guard, who is at the market. 

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence at the crossroads, allowing the guard to take action against the bandit.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.** The guard's movement is necessary to confront the bandit, as he is determined to eliminate criminals.

3. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.** This action is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of safely returning to the cottage with the medicine, as it removes the threat posed by the bandit.

4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** With the bandit defeated, Tom can now safely return to the cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.

In this sequence, each action is necessary to ensure Tom's safety and success in reaching the cottage with the medicine.
