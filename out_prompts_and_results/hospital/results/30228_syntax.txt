To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Admissions to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions and their purposes:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary to treat Ross based on the symptoms identified in the previous step, ensuring he becomes healthy.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Young based on the symptoms identified in the previous step, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
