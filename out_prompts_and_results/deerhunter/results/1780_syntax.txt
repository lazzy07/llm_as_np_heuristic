To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also present in the bank, and Bubba is greedy, wanting to acquire more money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire the clerk's money without any resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a way to utilize the situation to his advantage.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to take the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill his greed and achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger by consuming the clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Ensures Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money.
