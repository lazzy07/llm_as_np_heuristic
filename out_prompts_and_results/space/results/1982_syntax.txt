To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a friendly interaction.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After successfully making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship. This action ensures her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure that they are safe as well. This action shows her concern for the Lizard's well-being.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again on the surface, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.

This sequence of actions allows Zoe to achieve her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, while also ensuring the Lizard feels the same way.
