In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is now happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
- Alex is happy because they have helped Casey achieve their goal.

The final plan in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This story is concise and effectively leads to Casey's happiness with the minimum number of actions necessary.
