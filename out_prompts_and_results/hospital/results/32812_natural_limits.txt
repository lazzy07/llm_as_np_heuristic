Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway is determined to help Jones. After assessing, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. Young is also found to be healthy, and no treatment is necessary.
