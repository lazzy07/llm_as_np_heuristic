To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Jones, the first action is to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, and if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Next, Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomB to assess Young. This is important because Young is also a patient who needs to be treated to achieve Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

4. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross. This is the last patient who needs to be treated.

6. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating patients**: This is the ultimate goal of Hathaway's actions, as treating patients correctly will lead to their recovery and health.
