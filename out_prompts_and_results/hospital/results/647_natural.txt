**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway is unaware of what disease he has. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and with a workload of 3, Hathaway again risks making a mistake. This time, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young survives and becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy is achieved, as Young is now healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
