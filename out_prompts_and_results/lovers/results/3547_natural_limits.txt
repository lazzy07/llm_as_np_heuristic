In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers that are with Casey, Blake wants the chocolates in the dining room, and Casey wants the jewelry that Alex has. 

To achieve their goal, Alex decides to take a direct approach. Alex tells Casey, "I will trade you the jewelry for the flowers." This action is strategic because it allows Alex to get the flowers they want while giving Casey the jewelry they desire.
