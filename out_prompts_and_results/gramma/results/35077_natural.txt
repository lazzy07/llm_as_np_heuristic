**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market. (The merchant prefers to be at the market to maximize her coin collection.)
2. The guard walks from the market to the crossroads. (The guard is at the market and needs to check the crossroads for any criminal activity.)
3. The merchant buys the hero's coin from the hero using one of her coins. (The merchant wants to collect coins without becoming a criminal, and this action allows her to gain a coin legally.)
4. The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads. (The merchant returns to the crossroads to be in a familiar location and possibly interact with the hero again.)
5. The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard. (This action helps the merchant by ensuring the guard is aware of the bandit, which could lead to the bandit being dealt with, allowing the merchant to operate freely.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The merchant's first action of walking to the market is essential for her to be in a location where she can interact with customers and potentially sell items.
- The guard's movement to the crossroads is necessary to maintain order and check for any criminal activity, which aligns with his goal of killing criminals.
- The transaction between the merchant and the hero allows the merchant to gain a coin legally, which is crucial for her goal of collecting coins without becoming a criminal.
- The merchant's return to the crossroads keeps her in a position to interact with other characters and continue her business.
- Reporting the banditâ€™s location to the guard is a strategic move that helps the merchant by potentially removing a threat to her business, allowing her to focus on her goal of collecting coins.
