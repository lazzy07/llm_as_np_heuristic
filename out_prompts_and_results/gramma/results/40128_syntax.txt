To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market where Tom and the Merchant are located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to confront Tom to take the coins he has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has. This action is essential for the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is part of her goal.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This is necessary to return to her preferred location.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that she has coins stored in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to interact with Tom and the Merchant.
- Robbing Tom is crucial because it allows the Bandit to gain coins without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the Guard.
- Walking back to the Crossroads is necessary to return to her preferred location after the robbery.
- Taking the coins from the chest at the camp ensures that the Bandit has coins stored, which is one of her goals.
