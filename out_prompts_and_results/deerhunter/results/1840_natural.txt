Bubba is at the bank with the rifle and 1 money. He is hungry but has already achieved his goal of having 1 money. The clerk, who is at the bank, has 0 money and believes that Bambi is alive, but Bambi is not alive. 

To complete the story, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to go to the location where Bambi is, as he may want to check on the situation or gather more resources.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - Since Bambi is not alive, Bubba can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger.

After these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and still retains his 1 money. The story ends with Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money and being no longer hungry.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **Deciding to eat** is essential for Bubba to address his hunger.
- **Going to the forest** allows Bubba to access Bambi, who is now a source of food.
- **Eating Bambi** fulfills Bubba's hunger, ensuring he is no longer hungry.
