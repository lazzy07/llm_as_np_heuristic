**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that there are still two patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room C to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, which is a step towards assessing and treating them.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** (Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young first, as they are already in an exam room.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A.** (Assuming Young has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.** (Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones.)

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Jones has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.** (Finally, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross.)

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.)

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C.** (Assuming Ross has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.)

At the end of these actions, all patients are treated correctly, and Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
