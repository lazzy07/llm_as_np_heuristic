The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, takes the following actions:

1. The bandit attacks the guard. (The bandit is armed and wants to eliminate the guard, who poses a threat to her criminal activities.)
2. The bandit loots the guard's sword. (After defeating the guard, the bandit takes the sword to ensure she is better armed for future encounters.)
3. The bandit takes the medicine from the merchant's corpse. (The bandit wants to carry valuable items, and the medicine is a useful item that she can either use or trade.)
4. The bandit walks to the bandit camp with the medicine and the sword. (The bandit prefers to be at the bandit camp, where she can store her loot safely.)

At this point, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying valuable items (the medicine and the sword) and has eliminated the guard, ensuring her safety.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Attack the guard**: The guard is a threat to the bandit, and eliminating him allows her to operate freely.
- **Loot the guard's sword**: This action increases the bandit's armament, making her more powerful and secure in her criminal endeavors.
- **Take the medicine from the merchant**: The medicine is a valuable item that can be used or sold, contributing to the bandit's goal of accumulating wealth.
- **Walk to the bandit camp**: This action secures her position and allows her to store her items safely.
