To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.**  
   - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and Bambi is a potential source of food. By shooting Bambi, Bubba can satisfy his hunger.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Bambi is dead, which fulfills one of the conditions of the ending.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger.

4. **Bubba eats Bambi.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to fulfill his need for food.

5. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba can go to the bank to potentially take the money from the clerk.

6. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.

The sequence of actions ensures that either Bambi is dead (satisfying one condition) and/or Bubba has the money (satisfying the other condition). 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to shoot Bambi",
    "Bubba shoots Bambi",
    "Bubba decides to eat Bambi",
    "Bubba eats Bambi",
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcomes while adhering to the constraints of the story.
