To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe is in the cave, she will make peace with the Lizard again. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in each other's presence.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk back to the surface with Zoe. This action signifies that they are comfortable being together and are willing to explore the planet as friends.

5. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface will begin to erupt. This action introduces a sense of urgency and danger, but since both characters are now friends, they can work together to ensure their safety.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. However, since Zoe and the Lizard are friends, they can help each other find safety.

7. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe will teleport to the spaceship for safety. This action is necessary for her to escape the danger of the eruption.

8. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the cave, which is a safer location away from the eruption. This action ensures that the Lizard can remain safe and healthy.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
