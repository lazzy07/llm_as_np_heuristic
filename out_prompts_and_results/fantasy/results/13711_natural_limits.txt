In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Talia is feeling unhappy and is seeking wealth. Vince has some money but is not wealthy enough to make Talia happy. Gargax, who is also in the cave, is looking for wealth and is not concerned about happiness.

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is taken because Gargax wants to eliminate a competitor for the treasure and gain wealth. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had, which will increase Gargax's wealth and potentially allow Talia to access the treasure.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax takes the money that Vince had. This action is necessary for Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth, but it also indirectly helps Talia because it clears the way for her to access the treasure.

3. **Talia picks up the treasure**: With Vince out of the way and Gargax focused on his own wealth, Talia can now safely pick up the treasure that is in the cave. This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, which will also make her happy.

By the end of these actions, Talia has become wealthy by acquiring the treasure, which fulfills her goal of happiness as well.
