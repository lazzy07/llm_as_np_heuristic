To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex (C1) wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, making them happy.

2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: After the trade, Alex will move to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary for Alex to be in the right location to potentially give or use the chocolates later.

3. **give(C1, I2, C3, R21)**: Alex will give the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3). This action is necessary because it helps Casey achieve their happiness by receiving the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3).

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey will move back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This action is necessary for Casey to be in a position to potentially receive the jewelry.

5. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey will give the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to achieve their happiness by receiving the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy, fulfilling their goal.
