In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, as it will make him wealthy, and he also needs to ensure he is not hungry.

Hereâ€™s the shortest story where Rory achieves his goal:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** (Rory needs to leave the cave to find Vince, who has the money.)
2. **Rory proposes to Vince.** (Rory proposes marriage to Vince, which will make both of them happy.)
3. **Vince accepts Rory's proposal.** (Vince accepts the proposal, making both characters happy.)
4. **Rory and Vince get married.** (This solidifies their happiness.)
5. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** (Rory now has the money, which contributes to his wealth.)
6. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** (Rory returns to the cave to collect the treasure.)
7. **Rory picks up the treasure.** (Rory now has the treasure, making him wealthy.)

After these actions, Rory is happy (due to marriage), wealthy (from the money and treasure), and not hungry (as he has not become hungry during the story).
