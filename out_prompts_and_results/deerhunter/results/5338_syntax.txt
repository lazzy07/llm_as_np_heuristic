To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he knows that the bank clerk has money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to go back to the bank and steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can threaten the clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba realizes he is hungry. This action is included to show Bubba's need to eat, which is a natural consequence of his earlier decision to eat.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat Bambi. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and is a logical step after deciding to eat.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger after the confrontation.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba satisfies his hunger by eating Bambi, which is a natural consequence of his earlier actions.
