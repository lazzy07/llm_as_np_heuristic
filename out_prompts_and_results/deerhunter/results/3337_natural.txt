To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure his goal of having money. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and wants to eat Bambi, which is now dead.)
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and confirms that Bambi is dead.)
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to go back to the bank to interact with the clerk.)
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint.** (Bubba is greedy and wants to have money, so he steals it from the clerk.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and he needs to satisfy that hunger.
- **Bubba eats Bambi:** This confirms that Bambi is dead and fulfills Bubba's hunger.
- **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank:** This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the bank where the clerk is located to steal the money.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint:** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has eaten Bambi (confirming Bambi is dead) and has stolen money from the clerk, thus achieving his goal.
