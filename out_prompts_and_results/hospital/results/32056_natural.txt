**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A and observes a rash. Since Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Since both are in Admissions and their symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B and Ross to Patient Room C. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze due to the high workload and treats Jones with antibiotics. However, Jones does not have Flaze and dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats Ross with antibiotics. Ross does not have Flaze and dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones and Ross, Dr. Hathaway successfully treated Young, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
