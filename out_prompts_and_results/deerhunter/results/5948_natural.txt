To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank to avoid any potential confrontation with the clerk.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.** Now that Bubba has the money, he can satisfy his hunger by eating Bambi, who is dead in the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to address his hunger.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have 1 money, and the clerk has 1 money. This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal.)
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba wants to avoid the clerk after stealing the money.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi, who is dead, to satisfy his hunger.)

Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and has also addressed his hunger.
