To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger after he has successfully stolen the money. However, it does not directly contribute to the goal of having money or Bambi being dead.

The final situation after these actions will be:
- Bubba has 1 money.
- The clerk has 0 money.
- Bambi remains alive.

However, since the goal is to ensure that either Bubba has the money or Bambi is dead (or both), we can stop here as Bubba has achieved his goal of having money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the rifle** is essential for Bubba to have the means to intimidate the clerk.
- **Stealing the money** directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money.
- **Deciding to eat** is a personal need for Bubba but does not affect the outcome regarding Bambi.
