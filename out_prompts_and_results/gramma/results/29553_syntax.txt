To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where the Merchant is located, as the Merchant has coins that the Bandit can potentially rob.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs the Merchant, taking the coins she is carrying. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After successfully robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks back to the Camp to secure the coins in her chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit places the coins she has just stolen into the chest at the Camp, ensuring that she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to reach the Market to find the Merchant.
- Robbing the Merchant is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain coins without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the Guard.
- Returning to the Camp is necessary to secure the coins in a safe location.
- Finally, placing the coins in the chest at the Camp fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins stored there.
