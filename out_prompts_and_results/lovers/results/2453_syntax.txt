To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room to the bedroom. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room to the bedroom. This is done to ensure that Casey is present to witness Alex's happiness.

4. **tell(C3, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they have the flowers. This action reinforces the happiness of Alex by acknowledging that they have received what they wanted.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
