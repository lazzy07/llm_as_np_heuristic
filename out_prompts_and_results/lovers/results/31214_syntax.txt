To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to have an item to trade.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to interact with Casey and Blake, who are both present there.

4. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **put_down(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I1) in the living room after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to clarify the final state of the items.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
