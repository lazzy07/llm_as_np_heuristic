The bandit, having just looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is at the market and is likely to be on high alert after the attack. To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, she walks back to the bandit camp, where she has a chest to store her coins. 

**Action: The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**

This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can safely store the medicine and any coins she may acquire later. By moving to the bandit camp, she is also ensuring that she is away from the guard and any potential threats at the market.

In this scenario, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of being at the bandit camp with the medicine, as she can now focus on gathering more coins without the immediate threat of being caught.
