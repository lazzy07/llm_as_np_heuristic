To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where they can be assessed and treated. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, admitting Young will increase it to 3, but it is essential to have all patients in exam rooms.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for diagnosing the correct disease and providing the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is necessary to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This will ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
