In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Alex is already happy with the flowers, Blake can focus on making sure Casey is happy with the chocolates (I2).

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and help them achieve their happiness.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the chocolates, making Casey happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy with the flowers (I1).
- Casey is now happy with the chocolates (I2).
- Blake is happy because they have helped both Alex and Casey achieve their happiness.

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy by ensuring that both Alex and Casey are happy.
