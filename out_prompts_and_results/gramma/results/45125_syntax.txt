To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Guard, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Guard, taking the coin that the Guard has. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count to achieve her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Guard, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Guard, Market)**: The Bandit needs to acquire coins, and since the Guard is armed and present in the Market, this is a strategic move to take advantage of the situation.
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After acquiring the coin, the Bandit needs to move to a safe location (the Bandit Camp) to secure her loot.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action finalizes the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
