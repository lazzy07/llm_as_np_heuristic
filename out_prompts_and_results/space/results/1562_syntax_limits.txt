Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that she needs to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. Since they are already not fighting and have a friendly relationship, Zoe decides to take a step further to solidify their bond. 

Zoe approaches the Lizard and suggests they work together to find a safe place away from the volcano. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, agrees to join her. They walk together to a safer area on the surface, away from the imminent danger of the volcano.

This action of walking together not only helps them avoid the eruption but also strengthens their friendship, fulfilling both of their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
