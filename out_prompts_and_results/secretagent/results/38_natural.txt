To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent will take the following actions:

1. **The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby.**  
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to be in a location where they can confront the mastermind. The lobby is a central location that connects to the office and the cache.

2. **The secret agent kills the mastermind.**  
   - This action directly fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead. Since the secret agent is now in the lobby with the gun, they can execute this action.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. The secret agent is currently in the office with the papers and the gun. To confront the mastermind, they need to move to the lobby.
2. The secret agent moves to the lobby, where they can encounter the mastermind.
3. Once in the lobby, the secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind, achieving their goal.

The final situation is:
- The secret agent is alive.
- The mastermind is dead.
- The secret agent has successfully completed their mission.
