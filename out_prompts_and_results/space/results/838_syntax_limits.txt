Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, establishing a friendly relationship. To ensure their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, leaving the Lizard on the surface. 

However, this action angers the Lizard, as it feels abandoned. To resolve this, Zoe quickly realizes that she must reassure the Lizard of her intentions. She teleports back to the surface, where she can communicate her desire to remain friends and work together to find a safe solution.

In this story, the actions taken are:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports to the ship to ensure her safety, but this action angers the Lizard, which is not her intention.
2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe returns to the surface to reassure the Lizard and maintain their friendship, demonstrating her commitment to their relationship and mutual safety.

The story ends with Zoe and the Lizard working together to find a safe place away from the volcano, achieving their goals of being healthy, safe, and friends.
