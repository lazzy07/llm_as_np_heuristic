To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba's goal being met without any unnecessary actions.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk and ensure his safety while having the money.
2. **Bubba decides to eat.** - Bubba is hungry, and this action allows him to satisfy his hunger without needing to take any further actions that could jeopardize his goal.
3. **Bubba leaves the bank.** - Bubba can leave the bank knowing he has achieved his goal of having 1 money and is no longer hungry.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: This action is necessary for Bubba to ensure he is in a safe location after having stolen the rifle and to confirm his possession of money.
- **Deciding to eat**: This action allows Bubba to address his hunger, which is a basic need, ensuring he is not distracted by hunger while he has achieved his goal.
- **Leaving the bank**: This action signifies the conclusion of the story, where Bubba can leave knowing he has what he wanted.
