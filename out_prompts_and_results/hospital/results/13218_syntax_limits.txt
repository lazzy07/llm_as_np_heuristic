### Story Completion

After admitting Young to Exam Room B, Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. Given that Hathaway's workload is at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway decides to proceed with the assessment. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. 

2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking he has Jarkis. However, since Ross is actually healthy, he remains alive and healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room B. Young also shows no symptoms, and Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis as well.

4. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Young, like Ross, remains alive and healthy.

At this point, Hathaway has treated both patients, and despite the mistakes due to the high workload, both Ross and Young are alive and healthy. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy is achieved.
