Zoe, determined to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both their safety, decides to approach the cave where the Lizard resides. She walks from the surface to the cave, where she finds the Lizard. Instead of attacking or teleporting away, Zoe takes a moment to communicate her intentions of friendship and safety. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's genuine desire for connection, agrees to make peace. 

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to meet the Lizard, showing her willingness to engage directly rather than using teleportation, which could be seen as evasive or disrespectful.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship that aligns with both of their goals of safety and friendship.

With this simple yet effective approach, Zoe achieves her goal of making a friend in the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe.
