To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted Vince's marriage proposal, which can lead to her happiness. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Talia achieve her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where Rory is located. This is necessary because she needs to confront Rory about his proposal and ensure he understands her commitment to Vince.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action removes Rory from the story, eliminating any potential conflict regarding Talia's relationship with him. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, Rory's presence is no longer needed.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village. This is necessary for her to be with Vince, who is currently in the village.

4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action fulfills her relationship goal, leading to her happiness.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy (due to the treasure) and happy (because she is married to Vince).

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia needs to confront Rory and finalize her relationship with Vince.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action resolves the conflict by removing Rory, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia needs to return to the village to be with Vince.
- **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: This finalizes Talia's happiness through marriage.
