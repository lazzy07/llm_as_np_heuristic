Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that their workload is high and they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms. Since Young is already in Patient Room A, Hathaway decides to assess Young first.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition, leading to Young's recovery.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess the remaining patients, Ross and Jones, who are still experiencing unknown symptoms. This action is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By assessing and treating Young, Dr. Hathaway successfully helps one patient recover, which is a step towards achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
