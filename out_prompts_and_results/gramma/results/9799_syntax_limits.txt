To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market and needs to move towards the Crossroads to eventually reach the Cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom will continue on the path to the Cottage. This action is essential as it brings Tom to his desired location.

At this point, Tom will be at the Cottage with the medicine he purchased earlier. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's goal, and no additional actions are needed.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- The first action allows Tom to leave the Market and head towards the Crossroads, which is a necessary step to reach the Cottage.
- The second action takes Tom directly to the Cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.
