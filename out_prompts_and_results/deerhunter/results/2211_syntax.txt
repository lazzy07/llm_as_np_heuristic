To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the bank and needs to go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to encounter Bambi, who is a potential target for Bubba's greed.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which will enable him to eat and satisfy his hunger, while also potentially allowing him to take any money Bambi might have (though in this case, Bambi does not have money).

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is one of his immediate needs.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money again. This action is necessary to reinforce Bubba's goal of acquiring money, even though he has not directly obtained any from Bambi.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will return to the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to be back in a location where he can interact with the bank clerk again.

6. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the bank clerk using the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and ultimately achieves his goal of acquiring money.
