Bubba, feeling hungry after shooting Bambi, decides to eat the deer. Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger. After eating, Bubba feels satisfied and no longer has the desire to get money. However, he still has the rifle and the ammunition, which he can use to intimidate the bank clerk.
