To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks to the cave where Zoe is located. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard into the same location as Zoe, allowing for potential interaction.

2. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attacks the Lizard. This action is taken to initiate a conflict, which is a necessary step to create tension and lead to a resolution.

3. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard stuns Zoe in response to her attack. This action allows the Lizard to defend itself and creates an opportunity for a shift in their relationship.

4. **break_free(Zoe, Cave)**: Zoe breaks free from being stunned. This action allows Zoe to regain control and continue the interaction with the Lizard.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace. This action is crucial as it transforms their relationship from adversaries to friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends.

6. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

7. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the death of the Lizard. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also concluding the story with the eruption.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the Lizard dies due to the eruption, and Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption occurs.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
