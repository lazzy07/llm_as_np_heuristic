To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are now engaged. The quickest way to achieve Talia's happiness is for her to marry Rory, which will make both of them happy. Since Rory is currently in the Village, he needs to travel back to the Cave to marry Talia. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the Cave where Talia is located. This is necessary for them to get married.
2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action is essential because Rory needs to be in the same location as Talia to marry her. Without this action, they cannot proceed to the marriage.
- **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her primary goals. Since Rory has already accepted Talia's proposal, this marriage will ensure both characters are happy.

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goal of happiness.
