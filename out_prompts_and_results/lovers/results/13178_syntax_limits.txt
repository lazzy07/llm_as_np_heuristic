To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the living room (R22) and has put down the jewelry there. However, Alex is not happy because they do not currently possess the jewelry.

The simplest action to achieve Alex's happiness is for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. Since Casey is also in the living room and has the jewelry, this action will directly fulfill Alex's desire.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22).

After this action, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is necessary because it directly transfers the item that Alex wants (jewelry) from Casey to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
