To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary to allow Zoe to interact with the Lizard on the surface, where the volcano is located. 
   - Action: `teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)`

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, facilitating their interaction and potential friendship.
   - Action: `walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)`

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Since they are not fighting, Zoe and the Lizard can become friends. This action is crucial for both characters to achieve their goal of making friends.
   - Action: `make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)`

4. **The volcano erupts**: After making peace, the volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where the volcano erupts.
   - Action: `erupt(Surface)`

5. **The Lizard dies**: As a result of the eruption, the Lizard, who is on the surface, is killed. This fulfills the condition of a character dying due to the eruption.
   - Action: `kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)`

In summary, the actions taken lead to Zoe and the Lizard making peace, but the eruption of the volcano results in the Lizard's death. This combination of events fulfills the requirements of the story.
