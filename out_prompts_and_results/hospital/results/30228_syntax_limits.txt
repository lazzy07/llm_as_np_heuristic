**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway Ross with antibiotics in PatientRoomC**: Assuming Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the workload), he treats Ross with antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. However, this action is crucial for Hathaway to attempt to help Ross.

3. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess and treat the next patient, Jones, who is still waiting.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Ross**: This action is essential for Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment. Even with the risk of error due to high workload, it is a necessary step to ensure patient care.
  
- **Treating Ross**: This action is critical as it directly impacts Ross's health. Even if Hathaway makes a mistake, it is still an attempt to help Ross, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

- **Walking to Admissions**: This action allows Hathaway to continue his work and attend to other patients, ensuring that he is actively seeking to help all patients in the hospital.
