In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy. However, the flowers are already in the same room (R22) as Alex, but Alex is not happy yet. This indicates that Alex needs to take action to acquire the flowers.

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to themselves. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to possess the item they want, which is the flowers. By doing this, Alex will become happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers and will be happy.
- Casey and Blake will remain unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills the requirement.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving the flowers to themselves is a straightforward way for Alex to ensure they have the item they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
