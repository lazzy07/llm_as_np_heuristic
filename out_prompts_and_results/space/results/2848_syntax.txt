Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. The Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is also present, and both characters are in a precarious situation. To achieve the goal of the Lizard, which is to be healthy, safe, and to make friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard approaches Zoe and extends a friendly gesture, signaling a desire to communicate and resolve any misunderstandings. This action is crucial as it shifts the relationship from negative to positive, allowing them to become friends.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard decides to lead Zoe to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action ensures both characters can avoid danger and continue their budding friendship.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe follows the Lizard into the cave, ensuring that both characters are now in a safe location. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to bond further.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe expresses her gratitude to the Lizard for leading her to safety. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in their new environment.

By taking these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
