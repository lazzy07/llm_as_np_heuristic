After the events that have transpired, the Bandit sees an opportunity to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She knows that Tom is currently unarmed and has just looted the medicine from the Merchant. The Bandit decides to rob Tom to take the medicine and any coins he might have.

1. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, taking the medicine he just acquired. This action is crucial because it allows the Bandit to take an item that could be valuable in her dealings, and it also puts her in a better position to carry more items.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the Bandit walks back to her camp with the medicine and takes the coins from the chest. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in her possession.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
