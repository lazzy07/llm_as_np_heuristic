In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want item I2, which is currently unknown to them. To achieve their goal of happiness, Blake needs to find out what item they want and obtain it. 

Since Casey (C3) is happy with item I3, Blake can ask Casey about the location of item I2. 

Hereâ€™s the action sequence to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that they want item I2, which they believe is in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to express their desire for the item, prompting Casey to reveal its location.

After this action, Blake will know where to find item I2, and they can then move to that location to pick it up in a subsequent action (not included in this story as per the requirement for the shortest story).

### Explanation of the Action:
- **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Blake to communicate their desire for item I2. By doing this, Blake can potentially learn where item I2 is located, which is essential for them to achieve happiness.
