Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, assesses Young, who is experiencing a rash. Recognizing the symptoms, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is only 1, there is no risk of making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Jones and Ross, who are both experiencing fever. Dr. Hathaway assigns Jones to Patient Room A and Ross to Patient Room C.
