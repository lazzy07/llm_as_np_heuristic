To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the cottage, where he wants to be.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to fulfill Tom's goal of carrying the medicine, as he is now at the cottage.

The story is very short because Tom's goal is straightforward, and he only needs to walk to the cottage to achieve it. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, as they are either at the market or at the cottage without any immediate conflict.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.",
    "Tom uses the medicine."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage and fulfills his goal of carrying the medicine.
