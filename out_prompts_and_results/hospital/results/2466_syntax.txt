To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, we will proceed with assessing Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms as well. This is crucial to ensure that both patients are evaluated for their respective conditions.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is found to have a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is also found to have a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids as well.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their recovery.
