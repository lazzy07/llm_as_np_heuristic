To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to return to the village where Talia is, as he needs to interact with her to achieve happiness.

2. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Rory wants to be happy, and marrying Talia will fulfill that desire. Since Talia is alive and at the village, this action is possible.

3. **Talia accepts the proposal.**  
   - Talia's acceptance is crucial for both characters to achieve happiness through marriage.

4. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that Rory achieves his goal of happiness.

5. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's body.**  
   - Since Vince is dead and has the money, Rory can take it to increase his wealth.

6. **Rory's happiness is now 1 (from marriage), and his wealth is now 2 (1 from treasure and 1 from money).**  
   - This final state confirms that Rory has achieved his goals of being happy and wealthy.
