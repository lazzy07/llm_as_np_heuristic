Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. She knows that she needs to ensure her safety and the safety of the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take a proactive step to ensure both of them can escape the danger together.

Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, leaving the surface before the volcano erupts. This action ensures her safety and allows her to return to the ship, where she can plan her next steps to make friends with the Lizard in a safer environment.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the ship, she avoids the eruption and can think of ways to further her relationship with the Lizard in a safe environment.

The story ends here, as Zoe has successfully achieved her goal of being healthy and safe.
