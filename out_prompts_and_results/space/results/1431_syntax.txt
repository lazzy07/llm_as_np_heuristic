Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. They have just made peace, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals of friendship and safety. However, the surface remains dangerous, and they need to find a safer place to continue their interaction.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where it is safer. This action is necessary to move away from the dangerous surface and find a more secure location to build their friendship.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it shows the Lizard's willingness to join Zoe in a safer environment, reinforcing their budding friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship. This action is essential as it ensures that both characters are now allies, which contributes to their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety and health. This action is necessary for Zoe to secure herself in a safe environment while still maintaining her friendship with the Lizard.

5. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Cave)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship to join Zoe. This action is important as it shows that the Lizard is also prioritizing safety and is willing to be with Zoe, further solidifying their friendship.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
