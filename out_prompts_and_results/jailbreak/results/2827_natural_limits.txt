**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy stands in the hallway, contemplating his next move. He knows that the bully is locked in the gym, and he has the knife in his possession. With the bully unable to threaten him for the moment, Roy decides to take action.

Roy sneaks through the vents from the hallway to the gym. Once inside, he finds the bully, who is unaware of his presence. With the knife in hand, Roy confronts the bully and, in a swift motion, kills him. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief. He knows that he and Ernest can now be safe. He quickly leaves the gym, returning to the hallway.

Now, with the bully dead, Roy can focus on escaping. He goes to the laundry room, retrieves the civilian clothes, and puts them on to disguise himself. With the disguise in place, he heads to the highway, where he successfully escapes from the prison.
