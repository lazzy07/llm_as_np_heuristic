In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Alex decides to take the following action:

1. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.** This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the flowers. By picking up the flowers, Alex can finally achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows: 

- Alex is in the living room and is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still in the living room and is not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is still in the living room and is not happy because they still want the jewelry.

This single action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
