Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she faces the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. They have just made peace, but both are aware of the danger surrounding them. Zoe knows that to ensure both their safety and to foster friendship, they need to find a secure place away from the hazardous surface.

To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe decides to teleport both of them to the spaceship, where they can discuss their friendship and safety away from the dangers of the planet's surface.

**Action:**
- teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)

**Explanation:**
This action is chosen because it allows Zoe to take both herself and the Lizard to a safe location (the spaceship) where they can continue to build their friendship without the immediate threat of danger from the surface. By doing this, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a relationship with the Lizard.
