To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to leave the bank with the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk has it.
- **Steal the money:** This action is the means by which Bubba can achieve his goal of having money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal from the clerk.
- **Go to the house:** This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal of having money, but it provides a sense of closure, indicating that Bubba has left the scene after obtaining the money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba goes from the bank to the house."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story. Bambi is already confirmed dead, so both conditions are satisfied.
