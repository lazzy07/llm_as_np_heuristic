To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can safely leave the market without being attacked or hindered by the bandit or the guard. Given the current situation, Tom is already in the market with the medicine he looted from the merchant. The bandit is also in the market, and the guard is present as well. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will allow Tom to achieve his goal:

1. **report(Tom, Bandit, Market)**: Tom reports the bandit’s location to the guard. This action is necessary because it will draw the guard's attention to the bandit, potentially allowing Tom to leave without being attacked.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After reporting the bandit, Tom can safely walk to the crossroads. This action is essential for Tom to move towards the cottage.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action completes his journey to his desired location.

By reporting the bandit, Tom ensures that the guard will focus on the bandit, allowing him to escape without confrontation. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "report(Tom, Bandit, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine while avoiding any conflict with the bandit or the guard.
