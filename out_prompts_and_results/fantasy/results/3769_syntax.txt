To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted Vince's proposal, which can lead to her happiness if they marry. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince needs to travel to the cave to be with Talia, as they are currently in different locations. This is necessary for them to get married.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Once Vince arrives at the cave, Talia and Vince can get married. This will make Talia happy, as she has accepted his proposal.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory will travel back to the village. This action is necessary to remove him from the cave, as he is not part of Talia's goal of achieving happiness through marriage with Vince.

4. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is in the cave, will eat Rory. This action is included to ensure that Rory is no longer a factor in Talia's happiness, as he has proposed to her but she has chosen to marry Vince instead.

After these actions, Talia will be married to Vince, achieving her goal of happiness, and she will also have the treasure, contributing to her wealth.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Vince to be present with Talia to marry her.
- **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action removes Rory from the cave, ensuring he does not interfere with Talia's happiness.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action eliminates Rory, who could potentially complicate Talia's relationship with Vince.
