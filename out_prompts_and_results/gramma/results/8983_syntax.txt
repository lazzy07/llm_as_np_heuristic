To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to leave the bandit camp with the medicine and reach the cottage safely. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from the Camp to the Crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to leave the bandit camp and head towards the cottage.

2. **Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage.**  
   - This action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Walking from the Camp to the Crossroads:** Tom needs to exit the bandit camp where he currently is. This is the first step towards reaching the cottage.
  
- **Walking from the Crossroads to the Cottage:** After reaching the crossroads, Tom can directly walk to the cottage, which is his ultimate goal.

Since Tom is already carrying the medicine, he successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine after these two actions.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Camp, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
```
