To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young is currently unassigned to an exam room, and Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Young based on their symptoms.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Jones is also unassigned to an exam room, and Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Jones based on their symptoms.

5. **Treat Ross**: Since Ross has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Ross in Exam Room A. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: After admitting Young to Exam Room B and assessing their symptoms, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their diagnosis. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Jones**: After admitting Jones to Exam Room C and assessing their symptoms, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their diagnosis. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
