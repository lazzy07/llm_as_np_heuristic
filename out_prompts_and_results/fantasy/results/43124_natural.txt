2. **Rory takes the money from Vince.**  
   - This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he needs to acquire the money that Vince possesses.

3. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - This action is essential for Rory to achieve happiness, as marrying Talia will fulfill his emotional goal.
