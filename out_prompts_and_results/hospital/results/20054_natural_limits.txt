Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on him without increasing her workload significantly. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine the correct treatment for Jones.

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Jones becoming healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B, preparing to assess him next. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can also receive the care he needs, although it does not directly impact the immediate goal of making Jones healthy.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving her goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
