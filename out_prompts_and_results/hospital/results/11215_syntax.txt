To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Jones is assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C. Since Young is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will need to admit Young to an exam room first, which will increase their workload but is essential for treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones and determining their symptoms, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results.

5. **Treat Ross**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is crucial to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered. This prevents any mistakes that could arise from Hathaway's workload being too high.
- **Treating each patient** with the correct treatment based on their symptoms ensures that they become healthy, which is Hathaway's ultimate goal.
