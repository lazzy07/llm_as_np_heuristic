**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest realizes that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym and is threatening them both. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him without immediate threat.)
3. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is crucial as it gives Ernest the means to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
4. **Ernest enters the gym.** (Now that the gym is locked, he can safely confront the bully.)
5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Roy are safe.)

With the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on getting out of the prison with Roy.

6. **Ernest goes back to the hallway.** (He needs to regroup with Roy.)
7. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing for a safe escape.)
8. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action takes him directly to the outside, away from the prison.)
9. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise, he can leave without being recognized.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to eliminate the immediate threat of the bully while allowing Ernest to secure his escape. The locking of the gym door is a strategic move to ensure the bully cannot retaliate once confronted. The retrieval of the knife is essential for self-defense. Finally, the disguise and escape actions are necessary to achieve Ernest's ultimate goal of being alive and free.
