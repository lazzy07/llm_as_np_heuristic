To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex is happy by obtaining the item they want (I1, which is the flowers). Since Alex is already happy, we need to focus on making sure Casey is also happy, as Alex wants Casey to be happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R21)**: Alex (C1) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Casey (C2) for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates to be happy, and Alex is willing to give up the flowers to make Casey happy.

2. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Casey (C2) trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Alex with Blake (C3) for the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary because Blake wants the jewelry to be happy, and Casey is willing to give up the chocolates to make Blake happy.

3. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Blake (C3) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C2). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After these actions, we have:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake is happy because they have the chocolates.

Now, all characters are happy, and Alex has achieved their goal of ensuring Casey is happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R21)**: This action allows Alex to give Casey what they want (chocolates) in exchange for the flowers, which Alex is willing to part with.
- **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: This action allows Casey to trade the chocolates for the jewelry, which Blake wants, thus making Blake happy.
- **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: This action allows Blake to give the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.
