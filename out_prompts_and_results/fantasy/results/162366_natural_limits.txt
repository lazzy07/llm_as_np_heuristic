In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to ensure he has both the treasure and the money, as well as maintain his happiness.

Here's the completed story:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** (Rory needs to go to the cave to retrieve the money that Vince has, as he currently only has the treasure.)

2. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (Since Vince is alive, this action cannot happen. Instead, Rory can propose to Vince to marry him, which would allow Rory to share in the wealth.)

3. **Rory proposes marriage to Vince.** (This action is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy, as marrying Vince will allow him to access the money.)

4. **Vince accepts Rory's proposal.** (This action is necessary for both characters to be happy and for Rory to achieve his goal.)

5. **Rory and Vince get married.** (This final action solidifies their relationship, allowing Rory to be happy and wealthy.)
