To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax is currently in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, Gargax will increase their wealth, which is one of their primary goals.

2. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is already hungry from previous actions, but this action will reinforce that Gargax is still in a state of hunger, which is relevant for the next action.

3. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax will eat Talia, who is the only remaining human in the cave. This action will satisfy Gargax's hunger, achieving the second part of their goal.

After these actions, Gargax will have both wealth (from the treasure) and will not be hungry (after eating Talia).
