In the cave, Talia realizes that Gargax is hungry and that the treasure is within reach. To achieve her goal of becoming wealthy, she decides to take action. 

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** This action is necessary because Talia wants to become wealthy, and the treasure is the item that will help her achieve that goal.

2. **Gargax eats Talia.** This action is included because Gargax, being hungry and wanting wealth, will eat Talia to satisfy his hunger. However, this action also leads to Talia's demise, which is a necessary sacrifice for her to achieve her goal of wealth through the treasure.

3. **Vince takes the treasure from Talia's dead body.** This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which he can then use to help Talia's goal of wealth, as she is now deceased but has achieved her goal through the treasure.

In this story, Talia becomes wealthy through the treasure, even though she is no longer alive. The actions taken are necessary to ensure that Talia's goal of wealth is ultimately fulfilled.
