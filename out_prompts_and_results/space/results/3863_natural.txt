1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** - This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, where they can both be safe and healthy. The cave is a secure place that can protect them from the impending eruption.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in a safe space strengthens their relationship and ensures they can work together to face any challenges.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave.** - They decide to stay in the cave until the volcano finishes erupting. This action is crucial for their safety, as it allows them to avoid the dangers of the surface.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs while they are safely in the cave, ensuring that they are not harmed by the eruption.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard leave the cave after the eruption.** - Once the eruption is over, they can safely return to the surface, having avoided danger.
