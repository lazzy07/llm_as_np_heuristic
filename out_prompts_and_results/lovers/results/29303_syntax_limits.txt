To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Since Alex is currently in the living room (R21) and the jewelry is also in the living room, the simplest action for Alex to take is to pick up the jewelry.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the living room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Casey and Blake remain unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this action successfully achieves that.

### Explanation of the action:
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is the item they want. By picking it up, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
