To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and the clerk is the only character with money.
2. **Shoot the clerk:** This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk as a threat and to take the money without resistance.
3. **Pick up the money:** This action is the final step to ensure Bubba has the money he desires.
