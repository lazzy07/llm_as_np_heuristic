To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army, being armed, will take the Ark from Indiana Jones by force. This action is necessary because the US Army wants the Ark, and they need to ensure they have it before the Nazis can intervene.

2. **take(USArmy, weapon, Nazis, USA)**: The US Army will then take the weapons from the Nazis by force. This action is crucial to eliminate the threat posed by the Nazis, ensuring they cannot fight back or attempt to take the Ark.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: Finally, the US Army will open the Ark of the Covenant. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, this is acceptable as the goal is to ensure the Nazis are dead, and the Ark will be in the possession of the US Army.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- The first action ensures that the US Army secures the Ark from Indiana Jones, who is currently in possession of it. This is essential for the US Army to achieve their goal of having the Ark.
  
- The second action neutralizes the Nazis by taking their weapons, ensuring they cannot pose a threat to the US Army or attempt to reclaim the Ark.

- The final action, while resulting in the death of the US Army personnel, fulfills the requirement that the Ark is opened, leading to the demise of the Nazis as well, thus achieving the overall goal of the story.
