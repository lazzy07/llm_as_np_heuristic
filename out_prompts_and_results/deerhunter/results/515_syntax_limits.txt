To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome with only two actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to remove the bank clerk, who is the only character standing between Bubba and the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is incapacitated, Bubba can safely pick up the money from the bank, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.
