To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to treat the patients based on their assigned rooms without assessing them first, as the symptoms are unknown.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Walk from PatientRoomB to PatientRoomA**: Hathaway moves to Young's room to treat them.
2. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Since Young is in PatientRoomA, and antibiotics are the treatment for Flaze (which is the only disease that could be treated without knowing the symptoms), Hathaway treats Young. This action will make Young healthy.
3. **Walk from PatientRoomA to PatientRoomC**: Hathaway moves to Ross's room to treat him next.
4. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Ross is in PatientRoomC, and Hathaway treats him with antibiotics as well. This will also make Ross healthy.
5. **Walk from PatientRoomC to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway moves back to PatientRoomB to treat Jones.
6. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Finally, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, making him healthy too.

By treating all patients with antibiotics, Hathaway ensures that all patients become healthy, as they are all assumed to have Flaze.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking between rooms**: This is necessary for Hathaway to reach each patient in their assigned exam rooms.
- **Treating with antibiotics**: Since the symptoms are unknown and Hathaway's workload is high, treating all patients with antibiotics is the safest option to ensure they all become healthy.
