To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money.
2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Although Bubba already has a loaded rifle, this action is included to emphasize that he is prepared for any confrontation.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk, using the threat of his rifle to intimidate the clerk into compliance.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, allowing him to take the money.
2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action reinforces Bubba's readiness to use the rifle if necessary, ensuring that he can intimidate the clerk effectively.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and desire for money, allowing him to achieve his goal of acquiring the money from the clerk.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
