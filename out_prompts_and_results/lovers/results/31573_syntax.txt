To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but allows for potential interactions with Alex and Blake.

4. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Alex that they have the jewelry. This action is to inform Alex of their success in obtaining the item they wanted, which may also contribute to Alex's happiness.

5. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they have the jewelry. Similar to the previous action, this informs Blake of Casey's happiness, which may also contribute to Blake's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the dining room to pick up the jewelry.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: This is the action that allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room, where they can share their happiness with others.
- **tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey shares their success with Alex, which may help Alex feel happy as well.
- **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey shares their success with Blake, which may help Blake feel happy as well.

After these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
