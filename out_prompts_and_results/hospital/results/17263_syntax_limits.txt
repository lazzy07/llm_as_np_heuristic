**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway (Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A to determine if Young is showing any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Assess Hathaway (Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway moves to Exam Room C to assess Jones. This is important to ensure that both patients are evaluated for their symptoms and receive appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Hathaway (Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After determining that Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Young's recovery.

4. **Treat Hathaway (Jones, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Jones and finding that he has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This ensures that Jones also recovers.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The assessments are necessary to identify the symptoms of the patients, which is critical for determining the correct treatment.
- Treating Young with antibiotics and Jones with steroids ensures that both patients receive the appropriate care, leading to their recovery and fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
