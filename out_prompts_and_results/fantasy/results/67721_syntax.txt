To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who she has accepted a marriage proposal from. Since Talia's happiness is tied to her relationship with Rory, we can have them get married. Additionally, we can have Talia pick up the treasure, which will contribute to her wealth. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married, which makes Talia happy. This action is crucial because Talia's happiness is directly linked to her relationship with Rory, and marriage solidifies that bond.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is important because it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through her relationship with Rory, as they have already established a mutual commitment.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to gain wealth, which is another of her goals. By picking up the treasure, she increases her wealth status.
