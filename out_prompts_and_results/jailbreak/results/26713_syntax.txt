**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores, Ernest is in the laundry room with the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. He knows that the bully is a threat, and he wants to avoid confrontation. Meanwhile, Roy is in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes, ready to make his escape.

**Action 1:** Roy decides to crawl through the vents to the highway.  
*Explanation:* This action allows Roy to leave the prison without being detected, as he is already disguised in civilian clothes.

**Action 2:** Roy reaches the highway and puts on the civilian clothes to fully disguise himself.  
*Explanation:* Although he is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise and ensures he is ready to escape.

**Action 3:** Roy escapes from the prison.  
*Explanation:* This is the ultimate goal for Roy, and with the disguise and the location, he successfully leaves the prison.

**Final Situation:** Roy is now outside the prison, having achieved his goal of escaping. Ernest remains in the laundry room, still threatened by the bully, but he has the cigarettes, which he can use to negotiate or distract the bully later.
