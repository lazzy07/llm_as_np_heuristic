To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) has the chocolates (I3), and Alex (C1) is not happy because they want the chocolates (I3) but believes Casey has it. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) to be closer to Alex and to potentially communicate with them about the items.
   
2. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I2) while in the bedroom. This is a lie since Blake actually wants the jewelry (I2) but is trying to manipulate the situation to help Alex.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) to find out more about the jewelry.

4. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room, believing they can use them to trade or give to Casey.

5. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12) to find Casey.

6. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey, believing this will make Casey happy.

7. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey, now happy with the flowers, trades the chocolates (I3) with Alex for the jewelry (I2).

8. **give(C1, I2, C2, R12)**: Finally, Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake, making Blake happy.

Now, Blake has the jewelry (I2) and is happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to communicate.
- **tell(C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake lies to Alex about wanting the jewelry to manipulate the situation.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to follow up on the information given by Blake.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers to use as a bargaining chip.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex returns to the bedroom to find Casey.
- **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives flowers to Casey to make them happy, which is part of the trade.
- **trade(C3, I3, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey trades the chocolates for the jewelry, fulfilling both their needs.
- **give(C1, I2, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Blake, making Blake happy.
