In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, needs to assess and treat the patients in order to ensure they are healthy. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding the symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's health and ensures he becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Assess(Jones)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. This is essential for Hathaway to know which treatment to administer. 

2. **Treat(Jones, Antibiotics)**: If Jones is found to have Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This ensures that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By taking these two actions, Hathaway successfully diagnoses and treats Jones, leading to a positive outcome for the patient and achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
