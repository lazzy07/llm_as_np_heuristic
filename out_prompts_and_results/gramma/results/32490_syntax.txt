To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of his coin. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Crossroads with a coin. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully rob him.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

With these actions, the Bandit will successfully achieve her goal of having coins.

- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to retrieve the coins stored in the chest, ensuring she has a significant amount of coins.
