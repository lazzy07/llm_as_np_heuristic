Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess too many patients. Therefore, the best course of action is to first assess one patient at a time, starting with the one in Patient Room B, where Hathaway is currently located.

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing "Unknown," Hathaway will not know what disease he has yet, but this is necessary to proceed with treatment.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to check on the other patients, Young and Ross, who are currently there.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, where he was previously assigned. This action does not change Young's location but allows Hathaway to prepare for the next assessment.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C, where he was previously assigned. This prepares Hathaway for the next assessment.

5. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. Again, since Young is experiencing "Unknown," Hathaway will not know what disease he has yet.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is also experiencing "Unknown," Hathaway will not know what disease he has yet.

7. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. Since Jones is alive and healthy, this treatment is appropriate.

8. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. Since Young is alive and healthy, this treatment is appropriate.

9. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. Since Ross is alive and healthy, this treatment is appropriate.

By following this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.
