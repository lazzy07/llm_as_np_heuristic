To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Going from the forest to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to interact with him and take the money.
- **Stealing the money from the clerk** is the direct action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can successfully steal the money without any resistance from the clerk.

Here’s the complete story with the actions:

1. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.
2. Bubba steals the money from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.
