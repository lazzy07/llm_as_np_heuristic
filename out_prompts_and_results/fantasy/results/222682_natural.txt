To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. Here’s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** (Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, and Vince has money.)
2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (Gargax now has the money, fulfilling his goal of wealth.)
3. **Gargax eats Rory.** (Gargax continues to satisfy his hunger and wealth goals.)
4. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body.** (Gargax now has both the money and the treasure, achieving his wealth goal.)
5. **Gargax eats Talia.** (Gargax finishes his meal, ensuring he is not hungry anymore.)

In this sequence, Talia does not achieve her goal of happiness and wealth because she is ultimately eaten by Gargax. However, since the task is to ensure Talia achieves her goal, we can adjust the actions to focus on Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** (This removes a competitor for Talia's happiness and wealth.)
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body.** (Gargax now has the treasure, but Talia is still alive.)
3. **Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body.** (Talia now has the money, achieving her goal of wealth.)
4. **Talia's happiness increases as she is now wealthy.** (Talia is happy because she has achieved her goal of wealth.)

In this adjusted story, Talia achieves her goal of being wealthy, but her happiness is still at 0. To ensure Talia is happy, we can have her propose to Rory, and since Rory is dead, she can accept her own proposal, which would make her happy.

Final actions:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.**
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body.**
3. **Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body.**
4. **Talia proposes to herself.**
5. **Talia accepts her own proposal.** (This makes Talia happy.)

Now, Talia is wealthy and happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Rory",
    "Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body",
    "Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body",
    "Talia proposes to herself",
    "Talia accepts her own proposal"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures Talia achieves her goals of happiness and wealth while adhering to the constraints of the story.
