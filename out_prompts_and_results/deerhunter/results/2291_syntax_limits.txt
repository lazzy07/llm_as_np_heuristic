In this story, Bubba is driven by greed and hunger, while Bambi's primary goal is to stay alive. The bank clerk is also greedy but is not directly involved in the conflict between Bubba and Bambi. The story will focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money, which can be done by either stealing from the bank clerk or killing Bambi for food.

1. **Action: shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)** - Bubba, having loaded his rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is motivated by his hunger, as he needs to eat, and Bambi is a potential source of food. By shooting Bambi, he can satisfy his hunger and also eliminate a potential threat to his plans.

2. **Action: eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer. This action fulfills his hunger and allows him to survive, but it also means that Bambi is dead, which aligns with the goal of the story.

By taking these two actions, Bubba achieves his goal of having food (Bambi) and indirectly fulfills his greed by eliminating a living creature that could be a threat to his plans.
