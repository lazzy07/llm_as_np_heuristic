To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young is already assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room B. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Jones in the Admissions room. This is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms as well.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
