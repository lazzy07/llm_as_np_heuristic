Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, both wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. Since they are not currently fighting, they can take actions to improve their relationship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and extend a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it allows them to move from a neutral relationship to a positive one, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of making friends.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to explore the planet further and potentially find more creatures to befriend, aligning with her goal of making friends.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the surface. This action signifies that the Lizard is also interested in exploring and making friends, reinforcing their new bond.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As they reach the surface, the volcano begins to erupt. This action introduces a sense of urgency and danger, but since both characters are now friends, they can work together to ensure their safety.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now friends and have a mutual understanding, they can help each other find safety.

By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard establish a friendship that allows them to navigate the dangers of the planet together, ensuring both achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
