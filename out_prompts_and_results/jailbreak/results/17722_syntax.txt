**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Ernest is in the gym, but the bully is also there, and he feels threatened for both of their lives. Roy decides to take action to ensure their safety.

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Roy locks the gym door from the hallway. This prevents the bully from coming out and threatening them further, ensuring both he and Ernest are safe for the moment.

2. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. This disguise will help him escape without being recognized as a prisoner.

3. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: With the disguise on, Roy makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison.

By locking the gym door, Roy ensures that the bully cannot threaten Ernest while he prepares to escape. The disguise allows him to leave the prison without being caught by the guards.
