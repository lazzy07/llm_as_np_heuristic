To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already at the bank and has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to get the money. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any resistance and take the money without opposition. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and the clerk is the only obstacle in his way.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Bubba shoots the clerk to ensure he can take the money without any threat.
- Bubba picks up the money after the clerk is incapacitated.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money from the bank.
