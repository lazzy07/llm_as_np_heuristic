To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat the other patients, Ross and Young, if necessary. However, this action is not directly related to Jones's goal but is part of the overall hospital process.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients, including Ross, are healthy.

6. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are healthy.

7. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients, including Young, are healthy.

By following these steps, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy, and the other patients will also be treated appropriately.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

In this plan, the actions are structured to first ensure Jones's health, followed by the assessment and treatment of the other patients, maintaining the hospital's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
