**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take action. He knows that Ernest is in the cell block and is threatened by the bully. To help his friend, Roy moves to the hallway to assess the situation. 

In the hallway, Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from threatening Ernest further and gives Roy a chance to confront him without interference. 

Next, Roy crawls through the vents to the gym, where he finds the bully. With the knife he stole earlier, Roy confronts the bully. This is a pivotal moment as it allows Roy to take revenge for the threats against both him and Ernest. 

Roy successfully kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. With the bully out of the way, Roy returns to the hallway, puts on his civilian clothes, and escapes to the highway, achieving his goal of survival and freedom.
