Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, decides to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, he can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: After identifying Ross's condition, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Ross's recovery and aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions and admits Jones to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the attention he needs, as he is still in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring he is healthy, and prepares to address Jones's condition next.
