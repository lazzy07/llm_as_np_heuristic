To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the hero's corpse.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count. The hero is dead, and the bandit can take the coin without any resistance.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in a safe location.

After these actions, the bandit will have successfully achieved her goal of carrying coins and securing them in the chest.
