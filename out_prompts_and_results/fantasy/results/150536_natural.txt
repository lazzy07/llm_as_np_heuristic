To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure from the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire the treasure to increase her wealth, which is part of her goal.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to return to the village to interact with Rory and solidify her happiness through their relationship.

3. **Talia proposes marriage to Rory.**
