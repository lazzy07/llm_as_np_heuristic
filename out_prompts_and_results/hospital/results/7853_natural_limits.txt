Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload remains manageable.

Then, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Again, Jones has unknown symptoms, but Hathaway believes both patients are alive and healthy.

Finally, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing Young has Flaze due to the unknown symptoms. Fortunately, Young actually has Flaze, so the treatment is successful, and Young becomes healthy. This action reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2.

With Young treated successfully, Hathaway has achieved the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
