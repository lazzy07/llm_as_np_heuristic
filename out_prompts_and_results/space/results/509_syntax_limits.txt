In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both characters. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and both characters make peace, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends. 
2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. 
3. **The volcano erupts**: This action concludes the story with the volcano erupting, which is a critical event that fulfills the requirement of the ending.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This is necessary for Zoe to interact with the Lizard and work towards making friends.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This fulfills the requirement of the ending where the volcano erupts.
