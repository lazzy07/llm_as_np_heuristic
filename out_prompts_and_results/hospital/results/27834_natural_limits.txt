Dr. Hathaway is currently at Patient Room B with Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess Jones and treat him accordingly. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway will not be able to identify the disease yet, but this is a necessary step to understand what treatment is needed.
