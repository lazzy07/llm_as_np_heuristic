To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to have the flowers in order to give them to Alex, which is essential for Alex's happiness.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers they want, thus making Alex happy.

3. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Blake to pursue their own goal of finding the chocolates.

4. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is also not necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Casey to follow Blake and potentially trade or interact with them regarding the chocolates.

5. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the chocolates, which is their goal.

6. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.**  
   - This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy with the chocolates.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
