In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but currently, Casey (C3) has the flowers (I3) and is happy. Blake (C2) has the jewelry (I1) but is not happy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Blake to give the jewelry to Alex. This will make Alex happy, as they will have the item they want.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
- Blake will still be unhappy because they still want the chocolates, but that is not relevant to Alex's goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving the jewelry from Blake to Alex is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness. Since Alex's happiness is the only goal we are focusing on, this single action suffices.
