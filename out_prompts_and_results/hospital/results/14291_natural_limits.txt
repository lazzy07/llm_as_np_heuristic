**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B, as Young is experiencing a rash. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B and correctly identifies the rash as a symptom of Jarkis. With this knowledge, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. Young becomes healthy as a result.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. 

Now, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Ross, who is still in Admissions. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross is experiencing fever, but since Ross is actually experiencing fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy as a result.
