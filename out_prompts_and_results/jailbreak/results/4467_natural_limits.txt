Roy, aware of the bully's threats and the danger Ernest is in, decides to take action. He knows he needs to protect both himself and Ernest. Since he has the knife, he can confront the bully. 

Roy sneaks into the gym, where the bully is still engaged in his workout. With the knife in hand, Roy locks the gym door behind him to prevent the bully from escaping. The bully, surprised, turns to face Roy, but before he can react, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully.
