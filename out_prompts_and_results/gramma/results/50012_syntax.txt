To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine in his possession from the previous events. There are no other characters that can interfere with his goal at this point, and he does not need to interact with the merchant or guard since he is not a criminal and has no need for coins.

The final story is as follows:

1. Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for Tom to achieve his goal without unnecessary actions.
