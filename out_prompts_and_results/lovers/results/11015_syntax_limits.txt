In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Action: trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)** - Casey (C3) trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up in the living room with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is crucial because it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the happiness status of the characters will be:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they do not have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is unhappy because they have given away the jewelry (I3) but still have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3), which is what they wanted.

This single action is sufficient to achieve the goal of making Casey happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Casey achieving their goal with the minimum number of actions necessary.
