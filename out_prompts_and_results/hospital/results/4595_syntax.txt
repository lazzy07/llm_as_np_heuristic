To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will need to admit him to an exam room first. However, since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Ross without making a mistake. 

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This will allow Hathaway to treat Ross based on the symptoms observed.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is in Exam Room C. This will help determine Young's symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: Since Jones has already been assessed and has a known symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze).

5. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed.

6. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
