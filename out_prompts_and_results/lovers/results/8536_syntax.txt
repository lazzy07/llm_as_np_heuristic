To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R22). This action is important because it helps Blake to make Casey happy, as Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21). This movement is necessary for Casey to be in a position to interact with Blake and potentially trade items.

4. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Blake for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has in the living room (R21). This is the crucial action that allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R22) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Blake engaged with Alex.

After these actions, Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry (I3), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room to prepare for the trade.
- **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: This is the key action where Casey gets the jewelry they want, making them happy.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room, keeping the story cohesive.
