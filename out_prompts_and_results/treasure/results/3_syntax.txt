Hawkins, having spread the rumor that the treasure is buried on the island, sees that Silver is convinced. Both characters are currently at the port, and Hawkins knows that the treasure is indeed buried on the island. 

To achieve his goal of obtaining the treasure, Hawkins takes the following actions:

1. **sail()**: Hawkins and Silver work together to sail from the port to the island. This action is necessary because the treasure is located on the island, and they need to reach it.

2. **dig()**: Once they arrive at the island, Hawkins digs up the treasure. This action is essential as it allows Hawkins to access the treasure that he desires.

3. **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: Finally, Hawkins takes the treasure. This action fulfills his goal of obtaining the treasure.

Each action is necessary to ensure that Hawkins successfully reaches and takes the treasure while also utilizing Silver's belief in the rumor to facilitate their journey.
