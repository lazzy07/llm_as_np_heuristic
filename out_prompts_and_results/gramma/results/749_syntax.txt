To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Market**: The Merchant needs to be at the Market to sell her items and interact with Tom, who is currently there.

2. **Merchant buys the medicine from Tom for 1 coin**: The Merchant can buy the medicine from Tom, which will allow her to gain a valuable item while also giving Tom a coin. This action is beneficial for both characters, as it helps Tom move closer to his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

3. **Merchant walks from Market to Crossroads**: After the transaction, the Merchant returns to the Crossroads, where she can potentially interact with the Bandit.

4. **Merchant buys the medicine from the Merchant for 1 coin**: The Merchant can now sell the medicine back to herself for another coin, effectively doubling her coins without any criminal activity.

5. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Market**: The Merchant returns to the Market to continue her business and potentially sell more items.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully acquired 2 coins without engaging in any criminal activity.
