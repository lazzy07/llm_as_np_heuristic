**Story Completion:**

After venting to the highway, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he needs to escape the prison before the bully can threaten him or Ernest again. He looks around to ensure no guards are watching and quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. With his disguise on, he feels a surge of confidence. 

Roy then makes his way to the edge of the highway, where he can finally escape from the prison. He takes one last look back at the prison, knowing that he has successfully evaded the bully and the threats that came with being inside. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself, which is essential for his escape. This action is necessary because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards.

2. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: After disguising himself, Roy escapes from the prison. This is the ultimate goal of the story, as it ensures his safety and freedom from the threats posed by the bully and the prison environment.
