In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I1), which is currently with Casey (C2). To achieve this, Alex can take the following action:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to have the item they want, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (the flowers, I2).
- Blake remains unhappy as well, but Alex has achieved their goal.

The story is complete with just these two actions, as they lead to Alex's happiness.
