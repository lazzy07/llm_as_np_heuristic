Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit, who is also at the crossroads, and decides to take action. Knowing that the bandit is a criminal and poses a threat, Tom attacks the bandit with his sword, successfully killing her. 

After the bandit falls, Tom loots the bandit's corpse and finds the coins that she was carrying. With the bandit defeated, Tom now has the medicine from the merchant and the coins from the bandit, fulfilling his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
