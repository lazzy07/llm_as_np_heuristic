In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. The simplest way for Talia to achieve her goal is to have Vince, who has the money, travel to the cave and pick up the treasure. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** (This action is necessary for Vince to reach the treasure.)
2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.** (This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which can be shared with Talia, thus increasing her wealth.)

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy because she is married to Vince, who now possesses the treasure. Since Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, she can share in their wealth, achieving her goal of being wealthy. 

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **Traveling to the cave**: Vince needs to go to the cave to access the treasure, which is essential for Talia to become wealthy.
- **Picking up the treasure**: By acquiring the treasure, Vince can contribute to Talia's wealth, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.
