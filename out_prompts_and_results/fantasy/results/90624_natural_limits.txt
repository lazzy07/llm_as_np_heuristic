In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure from the cave, as it will make him wealthy. Since Talia and Rory are already married, Rory's happiness is already fulfilled. The only action needed is for Rory to travel to the cave and pick up the treasure.

Here’s the completed story:

1. Rory travels from the village to the cave.
2. Rory picks up the treasure.

**Explanation of Actions:**
