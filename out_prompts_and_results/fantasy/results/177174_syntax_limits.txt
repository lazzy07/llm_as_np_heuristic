In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. He has already picked up the treasure from the cave, but he is still hungry. To achieve his goal of not being hungry, Gargax will eat one of the humans present in the cave.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, who is in the cave with him. This action satisfies Gargax's hunger.

This action is necessary because Gargax's primary goal is to not be hungry, and eating Rory achieves that goal directly.

After this action, Gargax will have satisfied his hunger, thus achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
