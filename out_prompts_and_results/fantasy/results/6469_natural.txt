To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: This action is necessary because Rory needs to be happy, and accepting the proposal will make both Rory and Talia happy. Since Talia is at the cave and Rory is also there, this is a feasible action.

2. **Rory and Talia get married**: This action solidifies their happiness. Since both Rory and Talia are now happy, this step is essential for Rory to achieve his goal.

3. **Rory picks up the money from Vince**: Rory needs to become wealthy. Since Vince is at the village with the money, Rory will need to travel to the village to pick it up.

4. **Rory travels to the village**: This action allows Rory to reach Vince and the money.

5. **Rory takes the money from Vince**: This action is necessary for Rory to achieve wealth.

6. **Rory returns to the cave**: This action is to ensure Rory is back at the cave after acquiring the money.

7. **Rory eats**: This action is necessary for Rory to ensure he is not hungry anymore.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Rory accepts Talia's proposal (to become happy).
2. Rory and Talia get married (to solidify happiness).
3. Rory travels to the village (to reach Vince and the money).
4. Rory takes the money from Vince (to achieve wealth).
5. Rory travels back to the cave (to return after acquiring the money).
6. Rory eats (to ensure he is not hungry).

With these actions, Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
