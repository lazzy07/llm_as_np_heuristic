To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot treat Jones effectively.

2. **Treat Jones in Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze (fever), he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis (rash), he will receive steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess the next patient, Ross.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B, which is necessary to ensure he is assigned a room for assessment and treatment.

5. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms, which is essential for providing the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross accordingly, ensuring he receives the correct medication to become healthy.

7. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess the last patient, Young.

8. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C, allowing for his assessment and treatment.

9. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms, which is necessary for providing the correct treatment.
