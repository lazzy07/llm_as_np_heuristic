To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the flowers.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bedroom (R12). This action is not directly related to Alex's happiness but sets up Blake to potentially help Casey later.

4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This is necessary for Alex to be in a position to interact with Blake and Casey again.

5. **put_down(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex puts down the jewelry (I3) in the bedroom. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear space for future interactions.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the flowers they wanted. The other characters can still pursue their happiness, but Alex's goal has been achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R22)",
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "put_down(C1, I3, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the flowers.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the flowers they want.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: While not directly impacting Alex's happiness, it allows Blake to be in a position to help Casey later.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex returns to the bedroom, which is a common area for all characters.
- **put_down(C1, I3, R12)**: This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to manage items in the room.
