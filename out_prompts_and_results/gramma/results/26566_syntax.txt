To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had just bought from her. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp.
