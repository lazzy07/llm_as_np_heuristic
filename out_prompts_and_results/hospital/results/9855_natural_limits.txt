Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing the patients to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** 
   - This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms, which will help in determining the correct treatment. Given that Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to proceed with the assessment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**
   - Assuming that Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This action is crucial to ensure Ross's health, as it is the correct treatment for the assumed disease.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**
   - After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to an exam room to ensure that he can be assessed and treated next. This action is necessary to keep the workflow moving and to help Jones achieve his goal of being healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Ross, ensuring he becomes healthy. The admission of Jones sets up the next steps for his treatment, maintaining the hospital's goal of patient health.
