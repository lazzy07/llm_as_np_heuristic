To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, Ross is already assigned to PatientRoomB, and assessing him will help determine his symptoms. 

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can assess Young in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for his disease.
