In this story, we need to ensure that Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is essential to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment based on his condition.

2. **Treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the correct medication. This action is vital for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Since we are aiming for the shortest story possible while ensuring Ross's health, we will not include any unnecessary actions.
