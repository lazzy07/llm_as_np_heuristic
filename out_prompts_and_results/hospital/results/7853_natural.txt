**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that there are three patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room C to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, and Young dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Again, Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze due to the workload. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the workload. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is correct, and Ross becomes healthy.

In the end, Jones and Ross are healthy, but Young has died. Dr. Hathaway has done their best to treat the patients, achieving the goal of ensuring that the majority of patients are healthy.
