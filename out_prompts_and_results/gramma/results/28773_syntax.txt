To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom at the crossroads to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, who is unarmed. This action is successful, and the bandit takes the coin from Tom, increasing her total coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins in the chest. This action is necessary to ensure that the coins are secured and fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying coins.
