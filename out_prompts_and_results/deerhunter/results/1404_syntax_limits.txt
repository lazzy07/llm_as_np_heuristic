To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will go to the forest, where Bambi is located. This action is included to ensure that Bubba is in the same location as Bambi, which could lead to a potential confrontation or further actions if desired.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and it also sets up the possibility of Bambi being dead if Bubba decides to shoot her next.

  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
