Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. However, the surface is dangerous due to the imminent eruption of a volcano. To ensure both their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, which makes the Lizard angry. 

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to her spaceship to escape the dangerous surface. This action is necessary for her safety, but it angers the Lizard, which could jeopardize their relationship.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts shortly after Zoe leaves the surface, causing destruction. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and to show the danger of the surface.

3. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: After the eruption, the Lizard realizes that Zoe's actions were motivated by a desire for safety. The Lizard decides to forgive Zoe for teleporting away and they solidify their friendship. This action is crucial to achieving the goal of both characters wanting to make friends.

In this story, the actions taken lead to the volcano erupting, which results in the danger of the surface being eliminated, and both characters ultimately become friends despite the initial conflict caused by Zoe's teleportation.
