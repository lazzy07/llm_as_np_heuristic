Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has a loaded rifle, he decides to shoot Bambi. This action will allow him to eat and also fulfill his desire for money, as he can use Bambi's body to sustain himself.

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger and also to potentially gain something of value (Bambi's body) that he can use to barter or trade for money.
2. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after having killed Bambi.

After these actions, Bubba has achieved his goal of eating and can later use the remains of Bambi to potentially acquire money.
