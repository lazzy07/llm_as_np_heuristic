Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones and Ross, who are currently in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can begin to assess and treat him. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - Similarly, admitting Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him as well, increasing the workload to 3.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is now in Patient Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. If Jones has Flaze (fever), he can be treated with antibiotics.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway now needs to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. If Ross has Jarkis (rash), he can be treated with steroids.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, making him healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
