To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the Bandit prefers to be at the camp to achieve her goal of accumulating coins.
