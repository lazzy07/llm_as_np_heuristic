To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients, leading to their health and survival. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has the same symptom as Jones (SymptomA), Hathaway will assess Ross to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for SymptomA. Since we know that SymptomA corresponds to one of the diseases (Flaze), Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomA to assess Young, who is currently in that room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. If Young has SymptomA, he will also receive antibiotics.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones again to confirm his symptoms and ensure he is treated correctly. Since Jones is already in PatientRoomC, this will be a straightforward assessment.

6. **Treat Jones**: After confirming Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics) to ensure he recovers.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
