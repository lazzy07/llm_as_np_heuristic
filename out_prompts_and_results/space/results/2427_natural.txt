Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to his guardianship of the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, teleports to the surface to confront Zoe.

Once on the surface, the Lizard and Zoe find themselves in a tense standoff. The volcano begins to rumble ominously, indicating an imminent eruption. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to survive the eruption. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's sincerity and shared goal of safety, agrees to put aside their differences.

As they begin to bond over their mutual desire for safety, the volcano erupts violently. In the chaos, Zoe is caught in the eruption and tragically dies, while the Lizard, having been on the surface for only a moment, manages to escape back to the cave just in time.

This story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying, and the two characters making friends before the tragic event. The actions taken were necessary to illustrate the progression from conflict to friendship, culminating in the eruption that leads to Zoe's demise.
