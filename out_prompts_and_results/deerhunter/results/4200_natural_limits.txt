Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to eat Bambi, who is now dead. Since Bambi is not alive, Bubba can eat her without any consequences. After eating, Bubba feels satisfied and no longer hungry. 

Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having food, and since Bambi is dead, he can also claim that he has successfully dealt with the deer. However, he still needs to get money. Since the clerk is at the bank with 1 money, Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the clerk.
