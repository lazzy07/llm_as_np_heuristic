To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves to the Crossroads, where she can interact with Tom and the Merchant. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to be in a position to potentially rob Tom.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom of his coin. This action is crucial for the Bandit to increase her coin count, but it also indirectly helps the Merchant by creating a situation where Tom may need to buy more coins from her.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom walks back to the Market to buy another coin from the Merchant. This is necessary for Tom to continue his quest to carry the medicine back to the cottage.

4. **buy(Tom, MerchantCoin, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys a coin from the Merchant using the coin he just acquired. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without becoming a criminal.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market to continue her business and potentially sell more items.

6. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant buys the medicine from herself using the coin she just acquired. This action allows her to have the medicine, which is valuable for her business.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully acquired coins without engaging in criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.
