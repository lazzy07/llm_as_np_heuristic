To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, Merchant, TomCoin)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, which allows her to increase her coin count without committing a crime.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will then walk back to the Crossroads, maintaining her presence in a neutral area.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market again to continue her business.

5. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, Merchant, TomCoin)**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from herself, using the coin she just acquired from Tom. This allows her to have a valuable item while still maintaining her status as a non-criminal.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant maximizes her coin count while adhering to her moral code.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's movement between the Crossroads and Market allows her to stay in her preferred location while interacting with Tom.
- Buying the coin from Tom increases her wealth without engaging in criminal activity.
- The final purchase of the medicine allows her to have a valuable item, which can be sold later for profit.
