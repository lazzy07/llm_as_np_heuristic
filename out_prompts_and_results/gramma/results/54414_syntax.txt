To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly, which is one of her goals.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in the chest, which is another aspect of her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without any risk of being attacked since Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action secures the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, ensuring her success.
