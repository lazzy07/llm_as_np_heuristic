In the current situation, Blake (C2) is already happy because they have the item they want (I1). However, Alex (C1) is not happy because they do not have the item they want (I1). To ensure that Alex becomes happy, Blake can take the following action:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the living room (R22).
