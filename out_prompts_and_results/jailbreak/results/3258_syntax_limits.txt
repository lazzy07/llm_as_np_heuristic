Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his pack of cigarettes. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and the gym door is locked, which gives him a moment of respite. 

To protect himself and his friend Roy, Ernest takes the following action:

1. **Go to the Laundry Room**: Ernest moves to the laundry room to retrieve the civilian clothes. This action is necessary because he needs to disguise himself to escape the prison later.

2. **Steal the Civilian Clothes**: While in the laundry room, Ernest steals the civilian clothes. This is crucial for his plan to escape the prison without being recognized.

3. **Disguise Himself**: Ernest puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This is essential for his escape plan, as it will help him avoid detection by the guards.

4. **Go to the Hall**: Ernest then moves to the hallway, where he can access the vents leading outside.

5. **Vent to the Highway**: Finally, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway, where he can escape from the prison.

By taking these actions, Ernest successfully secures his safety and achieves his goal of being alive and free, while also avoiding any confrontation with the bully.
