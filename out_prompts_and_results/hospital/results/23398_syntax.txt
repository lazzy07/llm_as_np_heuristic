To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms as well. This is important to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment as well.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also essential for Young's recovery.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently there. This is necessary to ensure that Ross is also treated and becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is the last step needed to ensure that all patients are healthy.

7. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
