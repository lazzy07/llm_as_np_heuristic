To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Jones, Admissions, ExamRoomC)**: Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room. This action allows Jones to move to Exam Room C, where Hathaway can assess and treat them.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Jones, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure that all patients are accounted for and treated.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomA, ExamRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B. Since Young is currently in the admissions room, we will assume they have a symptom that Hathaway can identify. This action is necessary to determine Young's condition.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, ExamRoomB)**: Assuming Young has Jarkis (indicated by the rash), Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This action will make Young healthy.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomA, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room C. This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, ExamRoomC)**: Assuming Jones has Flaze (indicated by the fever), Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This action will make Jones healthy.

7. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, ExamRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition.

8. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, ExamRoomA)**: Assuming Ross has Flaze (indicated by the fever), Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This action will make Ross healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.
