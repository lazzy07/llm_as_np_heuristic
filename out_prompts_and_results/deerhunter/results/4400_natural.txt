To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the bank and the clerk has 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money. Since Bubba is hungry and wants money, he needs to ensure that the clerk cannot resist or retaliate.
   
2. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money that the clerk had, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Shoot the clerk:** This action is necessary for Bubba to gain access to the money without any opposition.
- **Pick up the money:** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."

``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of having 1 money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
