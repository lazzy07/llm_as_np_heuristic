To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can safely leave the bandit camp with the medicine and reach the cottage without being attacked or robbed. The following actions will help Tom achieve his goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Camp, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the bandit camp to head towards the cottage. This action is necessary for him to start his journey back.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom will continue on the path to the cottage. This action is essential for him to reach his destination.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Tom starts at the bandit camp with the medicine.
- He walks to the crossroads, which is the only path available from the camp.
- From the crossroads, he walks directly to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.

The actions taken are the shortest and most direct route for Tom to achieve his goal without any unnecessary interactions with other characters.
