Zoe, aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface of the planet is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows that she needs to make contact with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both of their safety and to foster a friendship. 

To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to the surface of the planet, where she believes the Lizard is located. This action is crucial because it allows her to initiate a conversation and potentially make peace with the Lizard, which is essential for both of them to feel safe and healthy.

Once Zoe teleports to the surface, she approaches the Lizard and makes peace with him. This action is necessary as it establishes a friendly relationship between them, aligning with both of their goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard and address the danger posed by the volcano.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, ensuring both characters can work together for their safety and friendship.

By completing these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
