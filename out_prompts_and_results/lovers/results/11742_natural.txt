To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex, which is essential for Alex's happiness.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers, which is what Alex wants to be happy.

3. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not directly related to Alex's goal but is necessary for Casey to eventually find the chocolates, which is what Casey wants.

4. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the chocolates, which is necessary for Casey's happiness.

5. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action brings Casey back to the living room, where the other characters are.

6. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to receive the chocolates, which is what Blake wants to be happy.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy, Blake has the chocolates and is happy, and Casey has the jewelry and is happy. 

The final situation is:
- Alex is happy with the flowers.
- Blake is happy with the chocolates.
- Casey is happy with the jewelry.
