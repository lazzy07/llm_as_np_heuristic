To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling satisfied after his recent actions. He has successfully stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and shot Bambi, which has left him with 1 money. Bubba is hungry, but he knows he has achieved his goal of having money. He decides to rest in the forest, content with his current state.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba stands in the forest** - This establishes Bubba's location and state of mind. He is aware of his surroundings and his achievements.
2. **Bubba feels satisfied** - This reflects Bubba's emotional state after achieving his goal of having 1 money.
3. **Bubba decides to rest** - This action signifies that Bubba is not in a rush to do anything else, as he has already accomplished what he set out to do.

Since Bubba has already achieved his goal of having 1 money, no further actions are necessary.
