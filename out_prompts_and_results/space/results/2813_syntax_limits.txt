Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the danger around her. She knows that to achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, she must act quickly. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take a proactive step to ensure their safety.

Zoe begins by initiating the action to **begin_erupt(Surface)**, which causes the volcano to start erupting. This action is a strategic move to demonstrate to the Lizard that they need to work together to escape the danger of the eruption. 

Next, Zoe and the Lizard, now united by the imminent threat, can work together to find a safe place. They both realize that they need to teleport to the spaceship to avoid the eruption. Zoe uses the action **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)** to get to safety. 

The Lizard, seeing Zoe's action and understanding the urgency, follows suit and also teleports to the ship. This action solidifies their friendship as they both prioritize their safety and health.

In the end, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard, who shares the same desires.
