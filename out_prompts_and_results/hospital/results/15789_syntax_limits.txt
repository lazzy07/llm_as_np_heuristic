### Story Completion

After assessing Young in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (SymptomB). Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they are at risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat another patient without reducing their workload. 

To ensure that all patients are treated correctly, Hathaway decides to treat Young immediately for Jarkis with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for the rash. This action will reduce Hathaway's workload by one and ensure that Young becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross, who are still waiting there. Since Hathaway has already treated Young, their workload is now at 2, allowing them to assess the next patient without the risk of making a mistake.

Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions, but since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot treat him yet. However, Hathaway can then walk to Admissions to assess Ross as well. 

After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that Ross is also showing symptoms of Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment, ensuring that Ross also becomes healthy.

Now, both Young and Ross are healthy, and Hathaway can return to Admissions to assess Jones again, but since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway will prioritize treating the patients already assessed.
