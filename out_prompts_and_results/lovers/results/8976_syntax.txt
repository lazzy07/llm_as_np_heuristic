To ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially trade or give items.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is a strategic move because it allows Alex to have an item, which may help in future interactions, even though it is not what Alex wants.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Blake and potentially trade or give items.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action is important because it allows Blake to have an item, which may help in future interactions, and it also opens up the possibility for a trade.

5. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers (I1) for the chocolates (I2) with Alex. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to finally obtain the flowers, which is what they want.

6. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21) to be in a familiar space after achieving their goal.

At this point, Alex has the flowers (I1), which makes them happy. The other characters may still be unhappy, but the goal is to ensure Alex is happy.
