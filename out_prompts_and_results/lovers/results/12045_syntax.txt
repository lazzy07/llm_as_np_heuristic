To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to interact with the items and characters effectively.

2. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to facilitate the next actions.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake and Casey trade items in the dining room. Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey in exchange for the flowers (I1). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates (I3), while Blake gets the flowers that Alex wants.

4. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the flowers. This is necessary for Casey to be in a position to give the flowers to Alex.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the living room. This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, and the story will conclude successfully.
