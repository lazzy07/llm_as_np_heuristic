**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Jones is necessary to identify if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. If Jones indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Rash, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with steroids, assuming he has Jarkis. If Ross indeed has Jarkis, he will become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Jones**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment. It is the first step in ensuring that Hathaway can help Jones.
  
- **Treating Jones**: This action follows the assessment and is critical for Jones's recovery. If Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's condition as Flaze, the treatment will be effective.

- **Assessing Ross**: Similar to Jones, assessing Ross is essential to identify his symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

- **Treating Ross**: This action is necessary to help Ross recover. If Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition as Jarkis, the treatment will be effective.

By completing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
