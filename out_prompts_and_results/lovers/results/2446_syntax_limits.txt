In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (the flowers), and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry. However, Blake is not happy because they do not have the chocolates, which is what they want.

To achieve their goal, Blake can take the following action:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This action is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and Casey to help achieve their happiness.

After this action, Blake will be in the same room as Alex and Casey, allowing for further actions to be taken in subsequent turns to help Blake achieve their happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: This action is essential for Blake to be able to communicate with Alex and Casey, as they are currently in the dining room. By moving to this location, Blake can potentially trade or give items to achieve their goal of happiness.
