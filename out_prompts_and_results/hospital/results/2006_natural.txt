**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that there are still patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Jones dies.

Then, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect, and Ross dies as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, and with the workload still at 3, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, and Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones, Ross, and Young, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at assessing and treating all patients, fulfilling the goal of ensuring that all patients were seen, even if the results were tragic.
