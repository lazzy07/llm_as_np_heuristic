To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness through their relationship. The next step is to acquire wealth, which can be done by obtaining the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the cave to the village to be with Talia and Vince, as he needs to strategize on how to get the treasure.
2. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave where the treasure is located.
3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, which will make him wealthy.

Now, Rory has achieved his goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by picking up the treasure). He is not hungry, as he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Rory to regroup with Talia and Vince, ensuring he has their support or knowledge about the treasure.
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to return to the cave to access the treasure, which is essential for achieving his wealth.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action directly leads to Rory acquiring the treasure, fulfilling his goal of becoming wealthy.
