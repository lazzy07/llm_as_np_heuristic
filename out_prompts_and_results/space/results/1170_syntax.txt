Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with other creatures. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard, sensing the danger of the volcano, decides to initiate an eruption to create a barrier that will protect them from potential threats. This action is taken to ensure that they can remain safe from external dangers while they build their friendship.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard completes the eruption, which creates a protective lava flow around them. This action solidifies the Lizard's goal of ensuring safety for both Zoe and itself, as the eruption will deter any other creatures that might pose a threat.

3. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: With the eruption complete, the Lizard and Zoe reaffirm their friendship. This action is crucial as it solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together in the future.

By taking these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
