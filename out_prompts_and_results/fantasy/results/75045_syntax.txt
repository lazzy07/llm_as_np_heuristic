To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to secure wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village to access the money that Vince has. This is necessary for Rory to become wealthy.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial as it directly increases Rory's wealth, fulfilling one of his primary goals.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

At this point, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is wealthy (having taken the money), happy (through marriage), and not hungry (as there is no indication of hunger in the story).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the Village**: This is necessary for Rory to access the money held by Vince.
- **Taking Money from Vince**: This action directly increases Rory's wealth, which is one of his goals.
- **Marrying Talia**: This fulfills Rory's goal of happiness, as marriage to Talia, who has accepted his proposal, brings him joy.
