To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom and potentially sell him items.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Market, where he believes he can find more coins.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will follow Tom to the Market, where she can sell her items.

4. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, giving her one more coin without committing a crime.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Camp)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Camp, where she can store her coins safely.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to acquire a coin legally and return to her preferred location without engaging in any criminal activity.
