Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to make peace with the Lizard instead of fighting. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing that they both want to be healthy and safe. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing their shared goals, agrees to become friends. 

As they are making peace, the volcano suddenly erupts, sending lava and ash into the air. Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, quickly teleport to the spaceship to escape the danger, but the eruption is too powerful, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise.

This story includes the following actions:
1. **Make Peace**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to become friends, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of safety and health.
2. **Eruption**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, which is a necessary conclusion to the story.

The actions are minimal yet effective in achieving the desired ending, where the volcano erupts, and the characters' relationship changes from enemies to friends.
