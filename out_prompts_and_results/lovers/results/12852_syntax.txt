To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R21) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) is in the same room and has the jewelry. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the flowers (I2) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey (C3) will have the flowers (I2) and will be happy as well, since they wanted to make Blake happy, and Blake (C2) will also be happy with the chocolates (I3) they have.

Now, Alex's goal of being happy is achieved.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R21)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to acquire the jewelry they desire, thus fulfilling their goal of happiness. It also indirectly supports Casey's goal of making Blake happy, as Casey will receive flowers in exchange, which they can use to make Blake happy later.
