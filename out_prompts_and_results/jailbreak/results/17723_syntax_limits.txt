**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows that Ernest is in the gym and that the bully is also there. To ensure his friendâ€™s safety and to escape, Roy quickly moves to the hallway.

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening either of them and gives Roy a chance to escape without further confrontation. 

With the gym door securely locked, Roy then crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he arrives at the highway, he takes off his disguise and successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
