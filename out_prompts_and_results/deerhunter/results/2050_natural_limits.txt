Bubba, after shooting Bambi, realizes he is still hungry and wants to eat. He decides to eat Bambi, which is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to feel fulfilled. Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can also take the opportunity to take the money from the bank clerk later, but for now, he focuses on eating.

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy that hunger. It also reinforces the fact that Bambi is dead, which is a key part of the story.

After this action, Bubba is no longer hungry, and he has consumed Bambi, ensuring that Bambi is dead. 

The final state is:
- Bubba is alive.
- The clerk is alive.
- Bambi is not alive.
- Bubba is no longer hungry.
- Bubba has 0 money.
- The clerk has 1 money.

Bubba can now go back to the bank to confront the clerk for the money, but since the goal is to have Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead, the story ends here.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:
