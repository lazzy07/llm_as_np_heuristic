To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either threaten the bank clerk or to hunt Bambi.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This is necessary for him to potentially encounter Bambi.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but adds to the narrative of Bubba's greed and hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Moves Bubba to a location where he can encounter Bambi.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Ensures Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the story's conditions.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Completes the narrative of Bubba's actions and desires.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, achieving the story's goal efficiently.
