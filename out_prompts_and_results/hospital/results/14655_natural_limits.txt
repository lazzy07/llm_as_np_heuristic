Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, assesses Ross, who is experiencing a fever. Recognizing the symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young, who is still waiting there. Hathaway assigns Young to Patient Room C. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcome for Young, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
