**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure the merchant can acquire coins without becoming a criminal. The merchant's actions are strategic, moving to the bandit camp to report the bandit, ensuring the bandit is eliminated, and then returning to the crossroads to safely conduct her business. The final action of buying an item with the bandit's coin allows her to achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.
