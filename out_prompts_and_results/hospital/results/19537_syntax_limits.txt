**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Hathaway then assesses Young, who is still in the admissions room. Finding that Young also has a rash, Hathaway treats Young with steroids as well, ensuring Young becomes healthy too.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Ross**: This action is crucial to identify Ross's condition and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot know what disease Ross has.
- **Treating Ross**: By treating Ross with steroids, Hathaway successfully cures him of Jarkis, fulfilling the goal of keeping patients healthy.
- **Treating Young**: Similarly, treating Young with steroids after assessing him ensures that both patients in the admissions room are healthy, which is Hathaway's ultimate goal.
