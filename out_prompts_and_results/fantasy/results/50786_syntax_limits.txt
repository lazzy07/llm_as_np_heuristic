To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia already has some money, which contributes to her wealth. However, she is not happy yet. 

The quickest way to achieve Talia's happiness is for her to marry Rory, as this will make both of them happy. Since Rory is currently in the cave, Talia will need to travel there to propose marriage.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels from the Village to the Cave to be with Rory, which is necessary for her to propose marriage.
2. **propose(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia proposes to Rory, which will lead to both of them being happy.

After these actions, Talia will be happy because she is now engaged to Rory.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to reach Rory, as she cannot propose marriage without being in the same location.
- **propose(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of happiness, as marrying Rory will fulfill her desire for happiness.
