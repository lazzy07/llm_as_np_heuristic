To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable after the previous events.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp and take the coins from the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then retrieves the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of maximizing her coin count.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: This action allows the Bandit to take Tom's coin, which is crucial for her goal of accumulating wealth without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed and cannot defend himself.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, ensuring she has a safe stash of wealth.
