Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high, decides to prioritize assessing and treating the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.**  
   - **Explanation:** Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room C. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - **Explanation:** By assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis. This is crucial for determining the correct treatment and ensuring Ross's health.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C with steroids.**
