To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, and Alex wants item I1 (which is currently with Casey), we need to facilitate a trade or transfer of items among the characters.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room to be closer to the other characters and the items.
   - **Reason**: This action allows Blake to interact with Alex and Casey more effectively.

2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that Casey wants item I2 (which is currently unknown to Alex).
   - **Reason**: This action is a strategic lie to create a situation where Alex might feel compelled to give up I1 to help Casey.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room to follow Blake.
   - **Reason**: This keeps the characters together, allowing for further interactions.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives item I1 to Casey.
   - **Reason**: Alex wants to make Casey happy, believing that this will also make Blake happy.

5. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the item I1.
   - **Reason**: This keeps the flow of items and characters moving, allowing for potential future interactions.

6. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up item I2 from the dining room.
   - **Reason**: This allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want.

At the end of these actions, Blake is happy because they have the item they wanted (I2). 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "give(C1, I1, C2, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)",
    "pick_up(C3, I2, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal while also considering the happiness of Alex and Casey.
