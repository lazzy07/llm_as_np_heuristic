Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She has already accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which means she has the potential for happiness through marriage. However, she currently has no money or treasure, which is essential for her wealth.

To achieve her goal, Talia needs to acquire wealth. Since Vince is in the cave with the money, Talia can travel there to obtain it. Once she has the money, she will be wealthy, fulfilling her goal.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where Vince is located. This action is necessary for her to reach the money.
2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is essential for her to become wealthy.
3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince. This action ensures her happiness, as she has accepted his proposal.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage) and wealthy (due to acquiring the money).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel**: Talia needs to move to the cave to access the money.
- **Take**: Acquiring the money is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.
