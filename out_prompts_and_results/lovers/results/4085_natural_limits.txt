In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Blake. To achieve their goal, Alex can simply ask Blake for the flowers.

**Action:**
1. Alex asks Blake for the flowers.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the flowers. Since Blake currently has the flowers, asking for them is the most straightforward way for Alex to achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex now has the flowers and is happy.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is still not happy because they still want the jewelry.
