Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to find a way to be safe and healthy. Meanwhile, the Lizard, safe in the cave, senses Zoe's presence and the threat of the volcano. 

To achieve their goal of making friends, the Lizard decides to take a peaceful approach. The Lizard teleports from the cave to the surface, where Zoe is. This action is crucial because it allows the Lizard to confront Zoe directly and establish a connection, rather than remaining hidden in the cave.

Upon arriving at the surface, the Lizard approaches Zoe and initiates a conversation, expressing concern for her safety and offering to help her find a safe place away from the volcano. This action is necessary for the Lizard to demonstrate its friendly intentions and to build a relationship with Zoe.

Zoe, recognizing the Lizard's willingness to help, agrees to follow the Lizard to safety. This mutual understanding leads to the two characters becoming friends, achieving both of their goals of safety and friendship.
