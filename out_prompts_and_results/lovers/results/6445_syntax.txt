1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to help fulfill their goal.

2. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This is important for Casey to understand what Alex desires, which may influence Casey's actions.
