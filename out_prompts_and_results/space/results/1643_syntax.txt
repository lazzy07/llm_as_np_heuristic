To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Given the current situation, the volcano is erupting, which poses a significant danger to both characters. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard. The Lizard shares the same goals. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to a successful outcome:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to get to a safer location away from the erupting volcano and to be closer to the Lizard, which is essential for building a friendship.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it shows the Lizard's willingness to be in the same location as Zoe, which is a step towards friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once both characters are in the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that they are no longer enemies, which is crucial for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by moving to the cave.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
