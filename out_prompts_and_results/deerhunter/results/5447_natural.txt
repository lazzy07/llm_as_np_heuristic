To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has 1 money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba eats the clerk.** (This action is not necessary for achieving the goal of acquiring money, but it can be included for narrative consistency.)
4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (Now that the clerk is dead, Bubba can take the money.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action is necessary to eliminate the only obstacle between Bubba and the money.
- **Eat the clerk:** While not necessary for the goal of acquiring money, it adds to the story's narrative and character actions.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
