Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to make peace with the Lizard, hoping to form a friendship that could help both of them survive. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to work together, emphasizing that they both want to be healthy and safe. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's sincerity, agrees to put aside their differences and they become friends.

However, as they are making peace, the volcano on the surface erupts violently. The eruption sends a wave of lava towards the cave, and despite their newfound friendship, Zoe is unable to escape in time. The lava engulfs her, resulting in her death.
