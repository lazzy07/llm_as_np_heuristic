To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway needs to first admit Ross to an exam room. However, since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Jones in PatientRoomA to confirm the symptoms before proceeding with Ross.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway needs to walk back to the admissions room to admit Ross.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room C, which is currently unoccupied.

4. **Walk to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will then walk to Exam Room C to assess Ross.

5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross**: Based on the symptoms assessed, Hathaway will treat Ross accordingly.

7. **Walk to Exam Room B**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room B to treat Young.

8. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

9. **Treat Young**: Based on the symptoms assessed, Hathaway will treat Young accordingly.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that both Ross and Young are treated properly, thus achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
