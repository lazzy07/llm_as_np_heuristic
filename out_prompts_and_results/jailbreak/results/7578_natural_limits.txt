**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He sneaks through the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently engaged in his workout. With the knife hidden in his pocket, Ernest locks the gym door behind him, ensuring they are alone. The bully, unaware of Ernest's intentions, continues to lift weights. 

Seizing the moment, Ernest confronts the bully and, in a swift motion, pulls out the knife. He knows this is his only chance to eliminate the threat once and for all. With a determined strike, he kills the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer in danger.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest takes a moment to catch his breath. He then heads back to the hallway, where he quickly puts on the civilian clothes he had seen in the laundry room earlier. Disguised and ready, he makes his way to the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
