**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, feeling threatened by the bully. Meanwhile, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison safely.

Roy locks the gym door from the hallway, preventing the bully from coming out. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, reducing the immediate threat to both him and Ernest. 

With the gym door locked, Roy then crawls through the vents to the highway. This action allows him to escape the prison without being detected by the guards or the bully. 

Once on the highway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, completing his disguise. This is the final step that allows him to blend in and escape from the prison.
