To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is greedy. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money, and the clerk is the only one who can provide it.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger, as he is currently hungry. 

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to get the money from the clerk's body. This action is necessary to fulfill his greed and achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk and take his money.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger after the confrontation.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money.
