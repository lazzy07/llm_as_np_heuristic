2. The bandit then walks back from the bandit camp to the market. This action is necessary to return to the market with the coins.

3. The bandit uses the coins in her possession to buy a sword from the merchant. This action is necessary to ensure the bandit is armed, which will help her in future encounters.

4. The bandit then walks from the market to the crossroads. This action is necessary to create distance from the guard and prepare for her next move.

5. Finally, the bandit walks back to the market, now armed and with coins, ready to confront any remaining threats or to further her criminal activities.

Through these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
