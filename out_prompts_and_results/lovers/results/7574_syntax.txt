To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates and is currently unhappy.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This action is essential for Casey to become happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to be with Casey. This is important for Blake to support Casey and also to facilitate the next action.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the key action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear the space and allows for a more organized outcome.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy, while Casey will have the chocolates, making them happy as well. Blake will also be happy as they have helped both Alex and Casey.
