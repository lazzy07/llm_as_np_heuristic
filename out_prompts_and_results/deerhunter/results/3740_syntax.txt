To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank with the clerk, and he is greedy and hungry. The clerk has money, and Bubba has a loaded rifle. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and he has the means to take it by force.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene after committing the theft.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is already dead (as a result of the previous shooting), Bubba can eat Bambi. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal of having the money, but it fulfills Bubba's hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba takes the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.
- **go**: Bubba moves to the forest to escape after the theft.
- **eat**: Bubba satisfies his hunger by consuming Bambi, which is a bonus since Bambi is already dead.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
