Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She knows that the Lizard is currently at the surface and is in danger. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help him, as she believes the surface is dangerous and wants to ensure both of their safety.

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** - By walking to the Lizard, Zoe can communicate and establish a connection, which is essential for making friends.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial for achieving her goal of making friends with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk back to the cave together.** - This ensures that both characters are safe from the erupting surface and can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
