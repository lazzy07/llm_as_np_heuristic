To complete the story with the goal of Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to steal from the bank clerk. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Although Bambi is already dead, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal of having money, but it fulfills Bubba's hunger.

The story can be summarized as follows:

Bubba enters the bank after having shot Bambi in the forest. He sees the bank clerk and, driven by greed, decides to steal the money from the clerk using his loaded rifle. After successfully stealing the money, he then goes back to the forest to eat Bambi, who is already dead.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling the goal of the story.
