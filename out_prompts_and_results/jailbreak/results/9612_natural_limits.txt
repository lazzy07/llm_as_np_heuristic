**Story Completion:**

As Roy is in the gym, he realizes that the bully is trapped inside with him, and the door is locked. With the knife in hand, he knows this is his chance to eliminate the threat once and for all. He approaches the bully, who is unaware of Roy's intentions. In a swift motion, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He then decides to put on the civilian clothes that he knows are in the laundry room. He sneaks through the vent back to the laundry room, quickly changes into the civilian clothes, and prepares to escape.
