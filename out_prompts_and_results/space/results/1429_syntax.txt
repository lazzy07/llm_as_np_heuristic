To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to initiate a friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows Zoe to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is one of her goals.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks to the cave to meet Zoe. This action is implied as the Lizard is already in the Surface location, and it is necessary for the Lizard to be in the same location as Zoe to solidify their friendship.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard reciprocates Zoe's peace offering. This action confirms their friendship and ensures both characters feel safe and healthy.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety.

This sequence of actions allows Zoe to achieve her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
