To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia is currently in a relationship with both Vince and Rory, but she has not yet married either of them. Since Vince has money, marrying him will help Talia achieve her goal of wealth. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where Rory and Gargax are located. This is necessary for her to interact with Rory and potentially marry him, but since she wants to be wealthy, she will ultimately choose to marry Vince.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's goal but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for the next actions to take place.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince in the village. This is the key action that fulfills Talia's goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (since Vince has money).

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Rory is not focused on wealth and is instead concerned about his hunger, which is a part of his character.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action demonstrates Gargax's nature as a dragon and serves to remove Rory from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her new life with Vince.

With these actions, Talia achieves her goal of happiness through marriage and wealth through Vince's money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Talia, Village, Cave)",
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Talia, Vince, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Talia's happiness and wealth while also maintaining the integrity of the characters and their motivations.
