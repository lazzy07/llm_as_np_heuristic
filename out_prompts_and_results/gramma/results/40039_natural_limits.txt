The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market and decides to take action. She approaches the guard and, knowing that the guard is not armed, she attacks him. The guard, caught off guard, is killed. The bandit then loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword and any coins he might have had. With the guard out of the way, the bandit now has the opportunity to take the medicine from the merchant's body, which she believes is still at the market. 

Now, with the medicine in her possession and the coins secured in her chest at the bandit camp, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can and having coins in the chest.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the guard**: The bandit attacks the guard because he is a threat to her safety and her goal of acquiring coins. Since the guard is not armed, she can successfully kill him.
2. **Loot the guard's corpse**: After killing the guard, the bandit loots his body to take any coins he might have, further increasing her wealth.
