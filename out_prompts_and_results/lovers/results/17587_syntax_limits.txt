In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (the jewelry) to be happy, and currently, Blake has item I2 (the chocolates) in the living room (R21). Casey (C3) is already happy because they have item I3.

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, Blake can give the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1), which will make Alex happy since Alex wants I3. This action is necessary because it directly addresses Blake's desire to make Alex happy, and it is the only action that can be taken to achieve this goal in the current situation.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want (I3).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they have the item they want (I3).
- Blake (C2) will not be happy yet because they still do not have the item they want (I2).
- Casey (C3) remains happy.

This single action is sufficient for Blake to achieve their goal of making Alex happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

{
  "plan": ["give(C2, I2, C1, R21)"]
}
