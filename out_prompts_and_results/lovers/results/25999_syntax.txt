To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants to have the item that makes them happy, which is not specified but can be inferred from the context. 

Given the current situation:
- C1 (Alex) is in R22 and has I1 (jewelry).
- C2 (Blake) is in R21 and does not have an item.
- C3 (Casey) is also in R21 and has I3 (chocolates).

Blake needs to get an item to be happy. Since Casey has chocolates (I3), Blake can trade with Casey to get the chocolates. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake trades with Casey, giving Casey the jewelry (I1) in exchange for the chocolates (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want (chocolates) while also ensuring Casey is happy with the jewelry.

After this trade, the situation will be:
- C1 (Alex) is in R22 with I1 (jewelry).
- C2 (Blake) is in R21 with I3 (chocolates).
- C3 (Casey) is in R21 with I1 (jewelry).

Now, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex is still not happy, but Blake's goal is achieved.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: This action is crucial as it allows Blake to obtain the item they want (chocolates) while also fulfilling the desire of Casey to have the jewelry. This trade directly leads to Blake's happiness, which is the goal of the story.
