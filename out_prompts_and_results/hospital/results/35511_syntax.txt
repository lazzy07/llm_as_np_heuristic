To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A and has a workload of 1, they can admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

2. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: Next, Hathaway can admit Jones to Exam Room C. This is also necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then walk to Exam Room B to assess Ross. This is important to determine Ross's symptoms so that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room C to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms for proper treatment.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is found to have the rash symptom (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is essential for Jones's recovery.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Jones are treated correctly, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
