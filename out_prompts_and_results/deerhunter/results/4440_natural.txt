To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal of having money, but it provides a logical conclusion to the story, as he may want to be in a safe place after committing the theft.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (This allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.)
- **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (This provides a conclusion to the story, indicating Bubba's departure from the scene of the crime.)

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba goes from the bank to the house."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of having 1 money while maintaining a logical flow in the story.
