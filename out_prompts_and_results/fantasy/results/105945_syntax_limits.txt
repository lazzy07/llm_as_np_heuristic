To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)** - Rory travels to the Village where Vince is located. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince to propose marriage to Talia, which will make him happy.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)** - Rory takes the money from Vince, who is in the Village. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy, as he currently has no money.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)** - Rory marries Talia in the Cave. This action is crucial because it fulfills Rory's desire to be happy through marriage.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved all of their goals: they will be happy from marrying Talia, wealthy from taking the money, and not hungry since they are not in a situation where they are starving.
