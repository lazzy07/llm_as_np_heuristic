**Story Completion:**

Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back down to the planet to find the Lizard and make peace. She teleports from the ship to the surface, which angers the Lizard, who perceives her as a threat to his territory. 

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard and approaches cautiously. The Lizard, feeling threatened, prepares to fight. However, Zoe quickly raises her hands in a gesture of peace, trying to communicate her intentions. The Lizard, confused but intrigued, hesitates. 

Zoe explains that she means no harm and wants to be friends. The Lizard, realizing that Zoe is not a threat, lowers its guard. They both sit down, and Zoe shares some food from her ship, which the Lizard finds delicious. 

As they bond over the food, the volcano begins to rumble ominously. Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize they need to escape the surface. They quickly teleport back to the ship together, just as the volcano erupts, sending lava and ash into the air.
