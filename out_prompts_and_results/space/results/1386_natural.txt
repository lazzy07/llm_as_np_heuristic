Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary to change their relationship from enemies to friends. Since both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends, this action aligns with their goals.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs naturally after the peace is made, fulfilling the requirement of the story. The eruption signifies the danger of the surface, which both characters are aware of.

3. **Zoe teleports to the surface.** This action is taken to confront the danger of the erupting volcano, which is a critical moment in the story. It shows Zoe's bravery and willingness to face challenges.

4. **The Lizard follows Zoe to the surface.** This action demonstrates the Lizard's commitment to ensuring Zoe's safety and reinforces their new friendship.

5. **Both characters are caught in the eruption.** This results in Zoe dying, which is a necessary outcome to fulfill the requirement of a character dying in the story.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while also establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the tragic event.
