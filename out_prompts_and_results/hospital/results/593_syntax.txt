To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Jarkis (the disease associated with a rash).

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross and confirming he has Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C. Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to determine them. If Jones has a fever, he has Flaze.

4. **Treat Jones**: If Jones is found to have Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, making him healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room. Young has SymptomB, which is also unknown, but if it is determined to be Flaze, Hathaway will treat him accordingly.

6. **Treat Young**: If Young is found to have Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
