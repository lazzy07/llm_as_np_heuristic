In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is in the possession of Casey, C2), and Blake knows that if Alex gets I3, Alex will be happy. 

To achieve this, Blake can take the following action:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I1) they have to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to help Alex, which is part of Blake's goal to be happy. Although this does not directly make Blake happy, it aligns with their desire to see Alex happy, which is a priority for Blake.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have chocolates (I1) and will be happy because they have received an item.
- Blake will not be happy yet, but they have taken a step towards making Alex happy, which is their goal.

The final plan in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R21)"]
}
``` 

This story is short and effective, as it only includes one action that directly contributes to Blake's goal of making Alex happy, while also allowing for the potential of future actions to further achieve happiness for all characters.
