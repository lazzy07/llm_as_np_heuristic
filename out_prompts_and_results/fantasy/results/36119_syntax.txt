To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where Gargax is located. This is necessary because Rory needs to confront Gargax to obtain the treasure, which will make him wealthy.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included because it is a necessary step to allow Rory to take the treasure from Gargax's body after he is dead. 

3. **take(Vince, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: After Gargax eats Rory, Vince can take the treasure from Gargax's dead body. This is essential for Vince to acquire the treasure, which will help Rory achieve his goal of wealth.

4. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for Vince to be in the same location as Rory and Talia.

5. **propose(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince proposes to Talia. This action is taken to establish a relationship that can lead to happiness for both characters.

6. **accept(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal. This is necessary for both characters to achieve happiness through their relationship.

7. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince and Talia get married. This finalizes their relationship and ensures both characters are happy.

At the end of these actions, Rory is considered wealthy because Vince has the treasure, and he is not hungry because he was not affected by hunger in this scenario.
