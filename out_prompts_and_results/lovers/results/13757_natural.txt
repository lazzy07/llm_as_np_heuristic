To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake wants the chocolates, which are currently in the dining room.

2. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.**  
   - This action is included because Alex is not happy and wants the jewelry. By giving the chocolates to Alex, Blake can create a situation where Alex might be willing to trade the jewelry.

3. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey is already happy with the jewelry. Since Alex now has the chocolates, they can give the jewelry to Casey, who wants it.

4. **Casey gives the jewelry back to Blake.**  
   - This action is included because Casey is happy with the jewelry and can now trade it back to Blake, who wants the chocolates.

5. **Blake is now happy.**  
   - This is the desired outcome, as Blake has successfully obtained the chocolates.

The sequence of actions leads to Blake achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates.
