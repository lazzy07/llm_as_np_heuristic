**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes. Roy moves through the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself further. With the disguise on, he makes a break for it and escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **go(Roy, Hall)**: Roy is already in the hallway, which is necessary for him to access the vents and escape.
2. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: This action allows Roy to bypass the gym where the bully is located and reach the highway directly.
3. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes to ensure he is not recognized as a prisoner, which is crucial for his escape.
4. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: This is the final action that allows Roy to successfully leave the prison and achieve his goal of being alive and free.
