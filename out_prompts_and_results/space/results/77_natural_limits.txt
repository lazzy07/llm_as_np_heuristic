Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back down to the planet to warn the Lizard. However, upon teleporting, she finds the Lizard still on the surface, unaware of the imminent eruption. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to communicate with the Lizard and help him.)
2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** (This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard and establish communication.)
3. **Zoe warns the Lizard about the volcano.** (This action is crucial for both characters' safety and to build a relationship.)
4. **The volcano erupts.** (This event is a natural consequence of the story's setting and adds urgency.)
5. **Zoe and the Lizard work together to escape the eruption.** (This action solidifies their friendship as they cooperate to survive.)

Through these actions, Zoe and the Lizard not only avoid the eruption but also form a bond, achieving their goals of safety and friendship.
