Gargax, feeling hungry and wanting to achieve wealth, decides to take action. He travels from the village to the cave where Talia and Rory are currently located. Upon arriving at the cave, Gargax sees Talia and Rory. Since Gargax is hungry and wants to become wealthy, he chooses to eat Rory, who is at the cave with Talia. After eating Rory, Gargax now has the treasure and is no longer hungry.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave**: This action is necessary for Gargax to reach Talia and Rory, where he can fulfill his goal of eating and obtaining wealth.
2. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger and also ensures he has the treasure, as he can take it from Rory's body after he is dead.

With these two actions, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
