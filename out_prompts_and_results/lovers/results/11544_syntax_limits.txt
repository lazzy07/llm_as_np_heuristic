In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I1). Currently, Alex is in the dining room (R22) and has just put down the flowers (I3) that Casey gave them. Blake is also in the dining room, and Casey is in the bathroom (R12) with the chocolates (I2). 

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action will take place:

1. **trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I2, R22)**: Blake can trade the jewelry (I1) that Casey has for the chocolates (I2) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is the jewelry, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy because they helped Alex achieve their goal.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex gets what they want, which is the jewelry. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, they are willing to trade the item they have for the item that Alex desires.
