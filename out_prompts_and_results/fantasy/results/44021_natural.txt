To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Rory needs to acquire it to increase their wealth.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the village to interact with Talia and Vince, who are both there, and to ensure he can share his newfound wealth.

3. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant for Rory's happiness but is included to maintain the narrative structure. 

4. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - This action is included to reinforce the bond between Talia and Rory, contributing to Rory's happiness.

5. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness.

6. **Rory gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to share his wealth, which contributes to both characters' happiness.

7. **Rory's happiness increases.**  
   - This is a result of the marriage and sharing the treasure, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.
