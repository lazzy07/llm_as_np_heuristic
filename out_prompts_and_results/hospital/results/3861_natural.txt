**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of Ross's condition.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still capable of making an accurate assessment.

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, assuming he might have Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, as Ross actually has Flaze, but Hathaway's workload is still manageable, and he does not make a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess and treat Jones. He admits Jones to Patient Room A again, increasing his workload to 3. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones's symptoms are still unknown, Hathaway cannot determine the correct treatment. However, he treats Jones with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze. This treatment is correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. He assesses Young in Patient Room B, and since Young's symptoms are unknown, he treats Young with steroids, assuming he has Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving his goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
