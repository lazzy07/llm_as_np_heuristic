**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to take action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young, who is in Exam Room A.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not make a mistake in this case because her workload is still manageable.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Young has Flaze (since the symptoms are unknown), this treatment is appropriate. If Young has Flaze, this will make Young healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is in Exam Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not make a mistake in this case either.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (since the symptoms are unknown), this treatment is appropriate. If Jones has Flaze, this will make Jones healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room B to Exam Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is in Exam Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not make a mistake in this case.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Flaze (since the symptoms are unknown), this treatment is appropriate. If Ross has Flaze, this will make Ross healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients (Young, Jones, and Ross) are treated appropriately and become healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients to ensure they become healthy.
- The sequence of walking to each exam room and assessing the patients is crucial to avoid mistakes and provide the correct treatment.
- The assumption that all patients have Flaze is based on the unknown symptoms, and since antibiotics are the treatment for Flaze, it is the logical choice.
