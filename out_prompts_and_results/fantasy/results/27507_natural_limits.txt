Rory, who is currently at the cave, realizes that Talia has the money and that the treasure is at the cave. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, he decides to take action.

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** This action is necessary for Rory to reach Talia, who has the money. By traveling to the village, he can interact with Talia and potentially improve his situation.

2. **Rory takes the money from Talia.** This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he takes the money that Talia has. Since Talia is married to Rory, she is willing to give him the money, which fulfills Rory's goal of being wealthy.

With these two actions, Rory achieves his goal of being happy (due to his marriage with Talia), wealthy (by taking the money), and not hungry (as he is not in a state of hunger).
