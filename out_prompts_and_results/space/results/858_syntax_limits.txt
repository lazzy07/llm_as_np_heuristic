Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship, aware that the surface of the planet is dangerous due to a volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is in a cave and is unaware of her presence. Zoe decides to teleport to the surface to warn the Lizard about the impending eruption.

1. **Action: teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to confront the Lizard and warn him about the volcano.

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard approaching from the cave. She realizes that they need to work together to ensure their safety. Instead of fighting, she decides to make peace with the Lizard.

2. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe reaches out to the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to escape the danger of the volcano.

As they stand together, the volcano erupts, but they manage to escape in time, solidifying their newfound friendship.
