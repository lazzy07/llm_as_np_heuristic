To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in the room). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to check for the item they want (I2). This action is necessary because Casey needs to be out of the way for Alex to pick up I3.

2. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This action is necessary to allow Alex to pick up I3 without interference.

3. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up I3 in the living room. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story.

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room. Similar to Casey's action, this is not necessary for Alex's happiness but keeps the characters together.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have I3, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to allow Alex to pick up I3 without interference.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake also moves to the dining room for the same reason.
- **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up I3, achieving their goal of happiness.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room, maintaining character presence.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room, keeping the characters together.
