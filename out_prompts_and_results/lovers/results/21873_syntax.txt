To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to interact with them.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers. This is essential as Casey needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the flowers to Alex.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
