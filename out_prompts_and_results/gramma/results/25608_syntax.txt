To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp, which is her preferred location, to secure her coins in the chest.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom will walk to the Market, where he can interact with the Merchant and potentially buy the medicine.

4. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom will buy the medicine from the Merchant using one of the coins he has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin while also fulfilling Tom's goal of carrying the medicine.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads to be closer to Tom and the potential for more transactions.

6. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads after purchasing the medicine, ensuring he is still in the vicinity of the Merchant.

7. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to maintain his presence in the area and keep an eye on Tom and the Merchant.

8. **walk(Bandit, Bandit Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads to check on the situation and see if she can take advantage of any opportunities.

9. **report(Merchant, spot: Bandit, place: Crossroads)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit's location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is targeted and potentially removed from the area.

10. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, as he is armed and the Bandit is not, leading to the Bandit's defeat.

11. **loot(Guard, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will loot the Bandit's coins from her corpse, which will increase the total number of coins in the Market.

12. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to continue her business and potentially sell more items.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, while also allowing Tom to carry the medicine he desires.
