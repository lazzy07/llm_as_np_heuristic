The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, sees an opportunity to further her goal of acquiring more coins. She decides to rob the merchant, who is armed but has the medicine that the bandit believes she can use to her advantage. 

1. **The bandit attacks the merchant.** This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the merchant as a threat and take the medicine, which could be valuable for her plans.
2. **The bandit loots the merchant's coin.** After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit takes the coins from the merchant, increasing her wealth.
3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** With her newfound coins, the bandit returns to her camp, where she can store her loot safely.

At this point, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she now has both the hero's coin and the merchant's coins.
