In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is in the same room. To achieve Alex's goal, the simplest action is for Blake to trade the jewelry with Casey for the chocolates (I2), which Blake wants. This way, Alex can then receive the jewelry from Casey.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) with Casey for the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R12). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to eventually get the jewelry, which is what they want to be happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be able to pick up the jewelry from Casey, making Alex happy.
- Casey will now have the chocolates, which they want, making them happy as well.
- Blake will have the jewelry, which they wanted to trade for, making them happy too.

Thus, all characters can achieve their happiness through this single trade.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
