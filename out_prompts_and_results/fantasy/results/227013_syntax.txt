To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory's happiness and wealth while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village to be with Vince, who has the Money. This is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.
  
2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the Money from Vince. This action is crucial as it directly increases Rory's wealth, which is one of his goals.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

Now, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is happy from marrying Talia, wealthy from taking the Money, and not hungry since he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel**: Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince to take the Money.
- **take**: This action is essential for Rory to gain wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
- **marry**: This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness, as marrying Talia makes both of them happy.
