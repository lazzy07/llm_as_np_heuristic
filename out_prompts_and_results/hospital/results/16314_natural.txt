**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose them. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with antibiotics, believing they might have Flaze. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to assess Jones and Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B and assesses him. Jones is also experiencing Unknown, but Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions. Ross is experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This treatment is also incorrect, and Ross dies.
