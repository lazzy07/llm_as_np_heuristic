To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory will travel back to the Village to be with Talia and Vince. This is necessary because Talia is currently in the Village and needs to interact with Rory to achieve her goal.

2. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince will also travel back to the Village. This is necessary for the same reason as Rory; Talia needs to be in the same location as both Rory and Vince to finalize her relationships.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia will marry Vince. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, this action will make both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness requirement.

4. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory will take the money from Vince. This is necessary because Talia needs to be wealthy, and since Rory has the treasure, he can take the money from Vince to help Talia achieve her wealth goal.

5. **give(Rory, Money, Talia, Village)**: Rory will give the money he took from Vince to Talia. This action will ensure Talia becomes wealthy.

Now, Talia is married to Vince (making her happy) and has the money (making her wealthy), thus achieving her goals.
