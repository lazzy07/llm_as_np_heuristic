In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Since both characters are currently safe in the cave, they have the opportunity to interact without the threat of immediate danger from the volcano.

To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, Zoe can take the action to make peace with the Lizard. This action will allow them to establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. After making peace, the volcano will erupt, leading to the death of one character.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's desire to make friends with other creatures. It also helps the Lizard achieve its goal of making friends.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After they have made peace, the volcano erupts, which is a predetermined event that will lead to the death of one character. Since the surface is now uninhabitable, Zoe will die as a result of the eruption.

The story ends with both characters achieving their goals of friendship, but at the cost of Zoe's life due to the eruption.
