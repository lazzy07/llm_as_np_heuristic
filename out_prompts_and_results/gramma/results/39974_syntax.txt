To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom at the Crossroads to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **Walk to Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit successfully robs Tom, taking the coin he was carrying. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of accumulating coins.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying coins and/or having them in the chest at the bandit camp.
