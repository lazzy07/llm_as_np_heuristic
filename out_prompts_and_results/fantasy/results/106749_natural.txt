To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Rory to take the money without competition. 

2. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body**: After Gargax eats Vince, Rory can take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Rory to become wealthy.

3. **Rory proposes to Talia**: Rory, now wealthy, proposes to Talia. This action is important because it allows Rory to pursue happiness through marriage.

4. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal, which is necessary for both characters to achieve happiness.

5. **Rory and Talia get married**: This final action solidifies Rory's happiness and fulfills his goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Gargax eats Vince**: Removes competition for the money and satisfies Gargax's hunger.
