Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, assesses Young in Patient Room A. Upon observing the rash, Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway will assess Ross in the next step. 

This sequence of actions ensures that both Young is treated correctly and that Ross is set up for assessment, allowing Hathaway to continue working towards the goal of patient health.
