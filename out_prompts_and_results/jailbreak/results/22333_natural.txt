Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. Knowing that Roy is in the gym with the bully, he decides to take action to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Ernest to reach Roy without being seen by the bully, as the gym door is locked.)

3. **Roy and Ernest both leave the gym and head to the hallway.** (This action ensures they are together and can plan their next move.)

4. **Ernest and Roy put on the civilian clothes.** (This action disguises them, allowing them to avoid detection by the guards and the bully.)

5. **Ernest and Roy crawl through the vents to the highway.** (This action takes them outside the prison, where they can escape.)
