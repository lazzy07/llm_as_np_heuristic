Bubba, driven by his hunger and desire for money, decides to take action in the forest where both Bambi and the rifle are present. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to either shoot Bambi or intimidate the bank clerk later.)
2. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** (Bubba wants to eat, and Bambi is a potential source of food. Shooting Bambi will also fulfill Bubba's goal of having money, as he can sell or use Bambi's meat.)
3. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** (This action is necessary to achieve Bubba's goal of eating and potentially gaining money.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** (Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger.)
5. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** (This action is included to ensure that Bubba has money, as he can take any valuables from Bambi after killing it.)

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money and has also satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi.
