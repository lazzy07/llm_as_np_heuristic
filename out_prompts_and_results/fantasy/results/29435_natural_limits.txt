To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia is currently at the village and the treasure is at the cave, she needs to either travel to the cave or have someone bring the treasure to her. However, since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, and they are both at the cave, they can help her achieve her goal.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** (Rory wants to help Talia and is aware that she is unhappy and has no wealth. By traveling to the village, he can bring the treasure back to her.)
2. **Rory gives Talia the treasure.** (This action directly makes Talia wealthy, which is one of her goals.)

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy, which will make her happy as well.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Rory travels from the cave to the village:** This action is necessary because Talia needs to be given the treasure to achieve her goal of wealth. Rory is the only character who can travel to bring the treasure to Talia.
- **Rory gives Talia the treasure:** This action directly fulfills Talia's desire to be wealthy, thus making her happy as well.
