1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk, killing him. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the threat and take the money from the clerk.
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of having money, and Bambi remains alive in the forest, but the story's focus is on Bubba's greed and hunger.

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
