In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Crossroads and has already attacked both Tom and the Merchant, leaving them both dead. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit has already attacked the Merchant, she can now loot the Merchant's corpse to obtain the medicine and any coins the Merchant may have had.

After this action, the Bandit will have the medicine and any coins from the Merchant, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The Bandit loots the Merchant because the Merchant is dead, and the Bandit can take items from her without any risk of retaliation. This action directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of accumulating wealth.
