To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess another patient without reducing their workload. However, since Ross is in a different exam room, Hathaway can assess him without increasing their workload further. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross in PatientRoomB, Hathaway can assess him again in PatientRoomC. This is necessary to ensure that both patients are evaluated properly.

3. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: Since Young has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway can treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomB, which is not specified but can be assumed to be antibiotics for Flaze. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. If Ross has a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Admit Jones to an exam room**: Finally, Hathaway should admit Jones to an exam room to assess his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated.

6. **Assess Jones in the admissions room**: Hathaway can assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

7. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are healthy.
