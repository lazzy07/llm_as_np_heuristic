To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and some ammunition, and he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he should also consider the bank clerk, who is still alive and has no money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next steps.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get more money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the rifle from the clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to intimidate the clerk and assert control over the situation.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to get money from the clerk. This action is necessary as it aligns with Bubba's greedy nature and his goal of obtaining money.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk and ensure that he can take the money without resistance.

6. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is necessary to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Allows Bubba to intimidate the clerk.
4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)** - Aligns with Bubba's greedy nature.
5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Eliminates the clerk as a threat.
6. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)** - Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
