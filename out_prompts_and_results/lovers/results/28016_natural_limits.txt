In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve his goal, Blake decides to take action. He picks up the jewelry from the living room and gives it to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to become happy, which in turn makes Blake happy since he wants Alex to be happy and knows that Casey is happy with the jewelry.

After this action, the situation is as follows: 
- Alex is still unhappy because he does not have the jewelry.
- Blake is now happy because he has helped Casey achieve happiness.
- Casey is happy because she has received the jewelry.

This minimal action allows Blake to achieve his goal of being happy by ensuring that Casey is happy with the jewelry.
