**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A, where Ross is located. Young is still in the admissions room, and Jones has just walked to Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway decides to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, he can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake. 
   
   - **Action**: `assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)`

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

   - **Action**: `treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomA)`

3. **Admit Young**: Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room B, where Jones is currently located. This is necessary to ensure that Young can be assessed and treated as well.

   - **Action**: `admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB)`

4. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2 again (after treating Ross), he can accurately assess Jones. 

   - **Action**: `assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)`

By following these actions, Hathaway ensures that both Ross and Jones are assessed and treated correctly, leading to Jones achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Ross allows Hathaway to determine the correct treatment for him, ensuring he becomes healthy.
- Treating Ross with steroids is the correct action based on his symptoms, which prevents any potential mistakes due to workload.
- Admitting Young to Patient Room B is necessary to keep the flow of patients moving and to ensure he can be treated.
- Assessing Jones allows Hathaway to identify his symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment, ensuring Jones's health.
