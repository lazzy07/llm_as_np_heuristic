Zoe stands on the surface, feeling the ground tremble beneath her feet as the volcano begins to rumble ominously. She knows she needs to act quickly. The Lizard, sensing the danger, approaches Zoe cautiously, unsure of her intentions. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - Zoe realizes that they both want to be healthy and safe, and that they need to work together to survive the impending eruption. By making peace, they can establish a friendship and focus on escaping the danger together.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - As Zoe and the Lizard are making peace, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. The eruption is sudden and catastrophic, and the surface becomes increasingly dangerous.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - Despite their newfound friendship, Zoe is caught in the eruption and tragically loses her life. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also highlighting the peril of the situation.

4. **The Lizard mourns Zoe.** - The Lizard, now feeling a bond with Zoe, mourns her loss. This action solidifies their friendship, as the Lizard recognizes the importance of their connection, even if it was brief.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard feeling a sense of friendship towards Zoe, despite her death. The story emphasizes the themes of connection and the fragility of life in the face of danger.
