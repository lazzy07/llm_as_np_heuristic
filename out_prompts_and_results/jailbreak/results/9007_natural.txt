**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy realizes that the bully is a significant threat to both him and Ernest. He knows he needs to act quickly to ensure their safety and secure a way to escape. 

1. **Roy moves to the kitchen.** (Roy needs to retrieve the knife to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
2. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to have a means of protection against the bully.)
3. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (Roy needs to get closer to the gym where the bully is located.)
4. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him without fear of retaliation.)
5. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)
7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, making it easier to escape without being recognized.)
8. **Roy goes to the highway.** (This is the final step to reach freedom.)
9. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.)
