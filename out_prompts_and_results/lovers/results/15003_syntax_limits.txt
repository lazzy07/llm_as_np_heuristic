In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is currently with Casey, C2), while Blake wants item I2 (which is currently unknown). 

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Blake to trade with Casey. Since Casey has item I3, which Alex wants, Blake can trade their item (which is I1) for I3. This will make Alex happy, and since Blake is also happy with the trade, Blake achieves their goal.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Blake trades their item I1 for Casey's item I3 in the living room (R22). This action makes both Blake and Alex happy, as Blake now has I3, and Alex also gets what they want.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item that will make them happy while simultaneously fulfilling Alex's desire for I3. This single action is sufficient to achieve Blake's goal of happiness.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
