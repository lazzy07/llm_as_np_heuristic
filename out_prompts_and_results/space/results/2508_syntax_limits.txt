In this story, Zoe and the Lizard have already made peace in the cave, establishing a friendly relationship. However, the volcano on the surface is still a threat, and it is about to erupt. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have Zoe take an action that leads to this outcome.

Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, which will anger the Lizard. This action will create a conflict, and since the volcano is about to erupt, it will lead to a dangerous situation for Zoe.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, which makes the Lizard angry. This action is necessary to create tension and set up the eruption of the volcano.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing danger on the surface. Since Zoe is now on the spaceship, she is safe, but the eruption will lead to the death of the Lizard, who is still on the surface.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe remains safe.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is crucial as it creates a conflict with the Lizard, who wanted to maintain peace. It also sets the stage for the eruption of the volcano.
- **erupt**: This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, leading to the Lizard's demise.
