To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a position to interact with the hero and the bandit, as she needs to sell items or acquire coins.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant of the medicine.**  
   - The bandit, being a criminal, can rob the merchant since she is not armed. This action allows the bandit to gain an item of value, but it also creates an opportunity for the merchant to react.

3. **The guard arrives at the crossroads.**  
   - The guard, who is at the market, will move to the crossroads to confront the bandit, as he is aware of her criminal activities.

4. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit, allowing the merchant to reclaim her medicine and ensuring that the bandit cannot take any more coins or items.

5. **The merchant loots the bandit's corpse.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to acquire the bandit's coins, thus increasing her total without committing a crime.

6. **The merchant walks back to the camp.**  
   - This final action allows the merchant to return to her preferred location with the coins she has acquired, achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The merchant's initial movement to the crossroads is essential for her to engage with the other characters.
- The bandit's robbery of the medicine creates a conflict that leads to the guard's involvement, which is crucial for the merchant's success.
- The guard's attack on the bandit resolves the threat and allows the merchant to benefit from the situation.
- Looting the bandit's corpse is a direct way for the merchant to gain coins without any criminal implications.
- Returning to the camp signifies the completion of her goal, as she now has more coins.
