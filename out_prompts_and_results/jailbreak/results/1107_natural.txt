**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decides to take advantage of the bully being in the gym.

1. **Roy moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and protect Ernest.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can deal with the threat without interference.)
3. **Roy takes out the knife from his pocket.** (This action is crucial as it gives Roy the means to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
4. **Roy kills the bully.** (This is the final action that eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to Ernest without fear of being threatened. He can also share the pack of cigarettes with Ernest, fulfilling both of their desires for safety and a smoke.
