To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom at the Crossroads to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, taking the coin he is carrying. This is essential for the Bandit to increase her wealth and get closer to her goal of having coins.

2. **Walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After successfully robbing Tom, the Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to store the coins in the chest, ensuring that she has coins secured at her preferred location.

The Bandit now has the coins she desired, either in her possession or secured in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
