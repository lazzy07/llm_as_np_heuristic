Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends, they need to establish a connection without fighting.

1. **Zoe initiates a conversation with the Lizard**: This action is necessary for Zoe to express her intentions of friendship and to understand the Lizard's perspective. Since they are not fighting, this is a peaceful approach to build a relationship.

2. **The Lizard responds positively**: The Lizard, being the guardian of the surface, recognizes Zoe's intentions and also expresses a desire for friendship. This mutual understanding is crucial for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard agree to work together**: They decide to collaborate to ensure the safety of the surface, especially with the volcano erupting. This action solidifies their friendship and aligns their goals.

4. **Zoe teleports back to the spaceship**: This action is taken to gather resources or information that can help them manage the volcanic activity on the surface. The Lizard understands this is necessary for their safety.

5. **Zoe returns to the cave with resources**: Upon returning, Zoe shares the resources with the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship and commitment to each other's safety.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard celebrate their new friendship**: They take a moment to acknowledge their bond, ensuring both feel healthy and safe in their relationship.
