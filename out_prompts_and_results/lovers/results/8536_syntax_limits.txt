In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. Currently, Casey is unhappy because they do not have the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

To achieve their goal, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry. Since Alex (C1) is already happy with the flowers (I1) they received from Casey, they can help Casey by giving them the jewelry. 

Hereâ€™s the action that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want.

- at(C2) = R21; 
- at(C3) = R22;
