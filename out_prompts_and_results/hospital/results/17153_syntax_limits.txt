### Story Completion

After assessing Young in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). To ensure Young receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis.

Next, Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit the other patients, Jones and Ross, to the exam rooms. Since both patients are currently in the admissions room, Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B and Ross to Exam Room C. 

After admitting both patients, Hathaway assesses Jones and Ross in their respective exam rooms. Since both patients are healthy, Hathaway believes they are alive and healthy. 

Finally, Hathaway treats both Jones and Ross with the appropriate treatments based on their symptoms, ensuring that all patients are healthy.
