To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can obtain from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will allow him to regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to obtain money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money without any resistance.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk. This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
