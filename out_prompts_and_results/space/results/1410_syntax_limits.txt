To complete the story, we will have Zoe teleport to the surface of the planet, where the volcano is about to erupt. This action will lead to the eruption of the volcano, resulting in Zoe's death. The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, will witness this event and, in the aftermath, will feel a sense of loss and a desire to make friends with Zoe's memory, thus establishing a bond with her spirit.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet, where the volcano is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the dangerous environment where the volcano can erupt.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to Zoe's death. This action fulfills the condition of the volcano erupting and results in a character dying.

After these actions, the Lizard, who is safe in the cave, will reflect on the loss of Zoe and decide to honor her memory by making friends with other creatures in the future, thus achieving a sense of companionship and safety.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **erupt(Surface)**: This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting and results in Zoe's death, which is a critical part of the story's conclusion.
