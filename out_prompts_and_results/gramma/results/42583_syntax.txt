To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit leaves the Market and heads to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to create distance between the Bandit and the Merchant, allowing the Merchant to operate without immediate threat.

2. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Merchant to be in a position to interact with the Bandit.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom walks from the Market to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for Tom to be in a position to interact with the Merchant and potentially buy coins.

4. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys a coin from Tom using the coin she has. This action is necessary for the Merchant to increase her coin count without committing a crime.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market. This action is necessary for the Merchant to be in a safe location where she can continue her business.

6. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard walks from the Market to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Guard to maintain presence in the area and ensure no criminal activity occurs.

7. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Crossroads to the Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to return to her base and secure her coins.

8. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to return home with the medicine.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully acquired a coin from Tom without engaging in criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.
