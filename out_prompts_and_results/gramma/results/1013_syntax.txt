To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can conduct business and potentially sell items for coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will also walk to the Market, where she can attempt to rob or interact with the Merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant of the coin she has. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins, but it also allows the Merchant to avoid becoming a criminal since she is not the one committing the robbery.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads after robbing the Merchant, taking the coin with her.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads to regroup and assess her situation after the robbery.

6. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy back her coin from Tom, using the coin she just received from the Bandit. This action allows her to regain her lost coin without becoming a criminal.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully acquired coins without engaging in criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's initial walk to the Market allows her to be in a place where she can interact with other characters and conduct business.
- The Bandit's robbery of the Merchant is a necessary action for the Bandit to achieve her goal, but it does not implicate the Merchant as a criminal since she is the victim.
- The Merchant's subsequent actions of walking back and buying her coin back ensure she retains her status as a non-criminal while still achieving her goal of acquiring coins.
