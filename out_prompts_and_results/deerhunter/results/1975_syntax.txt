To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba is at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk, which will allow him to take the money without any resistance.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only obstacle preventing him from taking the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to collect the money after the clerk has been dealt with.
