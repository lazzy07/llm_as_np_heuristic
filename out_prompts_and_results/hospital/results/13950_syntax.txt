To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A with Ross, the first action is to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway should walk to Exam Room B to assess Jones. This is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway should walk to Exam Room C to assess Young. This step is essential to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is critical to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
