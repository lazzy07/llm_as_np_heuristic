To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the clerk, and he is hungry and greedy. He has a rifle and ammunition, which he can use to intimidate the clerk into giving him money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to secure the bank without opposition.
   
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of getting money. By shooting the clerk, he removes any potential resistance and secures the bank for himself.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money. After the clerk is incapacitated, Bubba can safely take the money without any further obstacles.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of acquiring money while navigating the constraints of the story.
