To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the guard is armed and poses a threat to the bandit. By attacking the guard, the bandit can eliminate this threat and potentially take the guard's sword, which would allow for further actions without fear of being attacked.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.** After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit can loot the guard's corpse to take the guard's sword. This action is crucial as it provides the bandit with an additional weapon, enhancing her ability to defend herself or attack others in the future.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** With the guard eliminated and the bandit now armed, she can safely walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure her position and ensure that any coins she has can be stored in the chest at the camp.

4. **The bandit places her coins in the chest.** Finally, the bandit places her coins in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins secured in a safe location.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. The bandit attacks the guard to eliminate the threat he poses.
2. The bandit loots the guard's corpse to acquire the guard's sword, ensuring she is armed for future encounters.
3. The bandit walks to the bandit camp to secure her coins in a safe location.
4. The bandit places her coins in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins stored safely.
