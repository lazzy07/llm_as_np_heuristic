Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 3. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are seen and treated.
