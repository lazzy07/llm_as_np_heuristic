In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is happy with the jewelry. Since Blake is not happy, they need to take action to achieve their goal.

Blake decides to tell Casey that Alex wants the chocolates. This is a lie, but it serves Blake's purpose. Casey, believing Blake, moves to the dining room to get the chocolates for Alex, thinking it will make Alex happy. This leaves Blake alone in the bathroom with the flowers.

Blake then picks up the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.

**Explanation of Actions:**

2. **Casey moves to the dining room**: This action is a consequence of Blake's lie, allowing Blake to be alone in the bathroom.
3. **Blake picks up the flowers**: This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.
