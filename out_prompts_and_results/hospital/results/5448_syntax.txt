To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A and Ross is assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can then assess Young in Exam Room C. This is necessary to identify Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway can assess Jones, who is currently in the Admissions room. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on Young's symptoms.
