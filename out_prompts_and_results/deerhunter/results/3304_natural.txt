To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, to ensure the story flows logically, we can include a few actions that reinforce the situation without changing the outcome.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry, and since he is in the forest, he can choose to eat something. This action is necessary to show that Bubba is addressing his hunger.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: Since Bambi is alive and in the forest, Bubba can choose to shoot Bambi to eat. This action is included to demonstrate Bubba's survival instincts and the consequences of his previous actions.
3. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi, which allows him to eat. This action is necessary to show the direct consequence of Bubba's decision to eat.
4. **Bubba decides to eat**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer. This action reinforces Bubba's need to satisfy his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, and he has also satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi.
