To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive and in the same location as Bubba. The bank clerk is at the bank with 1 money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger. Additionally, it will lead to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
   
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and results in Bambi being dead. 

3. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can take any money that Bambi might have had (in this case, we assume Bambi has no money, but this action is included to ensure Bubba has something to take).

4. **Bubba goes to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money from the clerk.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi:** Satisfies Bubba's hunger and leads to Bambi's death.
- **Bubba eats Bambi:** Confirms Bambi is dead.
- **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi:** Although Bambi has no money, this action is included to ensure Bubba has something to take.
- **Bubba goes to the bank:** Moves Bubba to the location of the clerk to confront him.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** Achieves Bubba's goal of having money.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead.
