To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard will initiate a peace-making action with Zoe. Since they are both in the cave and not fighting, this action will help improve their relationship and allow them to become friends.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary for the Lizard to ensure its safety, as the surface is currently dangerous but it needs to be there to fulfill its role as a guardian.
