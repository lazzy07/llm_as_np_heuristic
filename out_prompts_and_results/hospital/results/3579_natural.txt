**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Again, Hathaway cannot identify the disease, but the workload remains manageable.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms as well. After assessing all three patients, Dr. Hathaway realizes that all patients are alive and healthy, but the symptoms remain unknown.

To ensure all patients are treated correctly, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat each patient with the appropriate treatment for both diseases, as a precaution. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Jones becomes healthy. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy.

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.
