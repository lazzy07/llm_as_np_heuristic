In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit has already robbed the Merchant of a coin and purchased medicine from Tom using that coin. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads with the medicine and one coin.

1. **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit can walk to the bandit camp and take the coins that are in the chest. This action allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

This is the only action needed to fulfill the Bandit's objective, as she already has one coin and the medicine.
