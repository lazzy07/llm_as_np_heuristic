To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the surface to interact with the Lizard and to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important as it allows Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a friendly interaction.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard in the cave. This action is crucial for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, as it establishes a positive relationship between them.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is included to show that the Lizard is willing to join Zoe outside, indicating a willingness to engage further.

5. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard will also attempt to make peace with Zoe on the surface. This reinforces the friendship and mutual understanding between them.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
