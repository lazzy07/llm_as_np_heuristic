The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, takes the following actions:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant and the guard are located, allowing her to interact with them.

2. **The bandit attacks the merchant.**  
   - The bandit is armed and the merchant is not, making this a viable action. By attacking the merchant, the bandit can potentially take the hero's coin that the merchant is carrying.

3. **The bandit loots the item from the corpse of the merchant.**  
   - After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit can loot the coin that the merchant had, thus achieving her goal of carrying more coins.

At this point, the bandit has successfully acquired the coin from the merchant, fulfilling her desire to carry as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is essential for the bandit to move to the market where the merchant is located.
- The second action allows the bandit to eliminate the merchant, who is a barrier to obtaining the coin.
- The third action enables the bandit to collect the coin from the merchant's corpse, directly achieving her goal.
