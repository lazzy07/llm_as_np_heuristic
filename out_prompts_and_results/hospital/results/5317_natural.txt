**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C to ensure all patients are seen. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect, and Ross dies.

Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is incorrect, and Young dies.

Finally, Hathaway returns to the admissions room to assess Jones. Since Jones is still in admissions and has unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Despite the mistakes made due to the high workload, Hathaway's goal of treating all patients is achieved, albeit with tragic outcomes.
