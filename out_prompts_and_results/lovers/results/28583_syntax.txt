3. **Blake moves to the living room (R22)**: Blake needs to move to the living room to be closer to Casey and to facilitate the next action.

4. **Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey in the living room (R22)**: This action allows Casey to receive the item they want, which will make them happy.

5. **Casey picks up the flowers (I3) in the living room (R22)**: Finally, Casey picks up the item they want, achieving their goal of happiness.
