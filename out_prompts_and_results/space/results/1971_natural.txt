To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be on the surface where the volcano is located to be affected by its eruption.

2. **The volcano on the surface begins to erupt.**  
   - This event is crucial as it sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's death.

3. **The volcano on the surface finishes erupting.**  
   - This action will result in the death of the Lizard, as it is now on the surface when the eruption occurs.

4. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - Zoe needs to teleport to the surface to witness the aftermath of the eruption and to ensure that she can still be friends with the Lizard, even after its death.

5. **Zoe makes peace with the memory of the Lizard.**  
   - This action allows Zoe to process the loss of her friend and solidifies their friendship, even in death.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe to maintain her friendship with the Lizard through her actions.
