To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano and the death of one character. The goal is to create a scenario where Zoe and the Lizard can become friends, but the eruption will ultimately lead to one of them dying.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is taken to establish a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. Since they are both in the cave and not fighting, they can become friends. This aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

2. **Erupt the surface**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and leads to the death of one character.

3. **Zoe dies**: Since the eruption occurs on the surface, and Zoe is not in a safe location (the cave), she will die as a result of the eruption.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. Zoe walks to the Lizard in the cave and makes peace with him.
2. The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface.
3. Zoe, who is not safe on the surface, dies due to the eruption.

This sequence ensures that both characters achieve their goal of making friends, but ultimately leads to Zoe's death due to the eruption.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their desire for companionship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action triggers the volcano to erupt, which is a critical event in the story.
- **kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)**: This action signifies that Zoe dies as a result of the eruption, completing the story with the required outcome. 

This sequence of actions leads to the desired ending while ensuring that the characters' motivations are respected.
