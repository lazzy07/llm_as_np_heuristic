To complete the story where the Secret Agent achieves their goal of killing the Mastermind, we need to ensure that the Secret Agent can acquire the gun and then move to the Mastermind's location to execute the kill. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Courtyard to the Lobby. This is necessary because the Secret Agent needs to access the Office or the Cache to find the gun, and the Lobby is the connecting point to both locations.

2. **find(SecretAgent, Gun, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent discovers the gun in the Lobby. This action is essential as the Secret Agent needs the gun to kill the Mastermind.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Office. This is where the Mastermind is believed to be, and the Secret Agent needs to confront them.

4. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind in the Office. This is the final action that achieves the Secret Agent's goal.
