To achieve the goal of getting Tom to the cottage with the medicine, we can follow these actions:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit, who is armed, can rob the Merchant to take the medicine. This is necessary because Tom is not armed and cannot take the medicine himself. The Bandit wants to carry coins, but since the goal is to get the medicine to Tom, this action is essential.

2. **Walk to the Cottage**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit can walk to the cottage. This action is necessary to move the medicine to Tom's desired location.

3. **Give the Medicine to Tom**: The Bandit can then give the medicine to Tom. This action is crucial for Tom to achieve his goal of having the medicine at the cottage.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Rob(Merchant, Medicine, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant to take the medicine. This is necessary because Tom needs the medicine, and the Bandit is the only one armed and able to take it.

2. **Walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Bandit walks to the cottage with the medicine. This is necessary to get the medicine to Tom's desired location.

3. **Give(Bandit, Medicine, Tom)**: The Bandit gives the medicine to Tom. This final action ensures that Tom has the medicine at the cottage, fulfilling his goal.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "rob(Merchant, Medicine, Bandit, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "give(Bandit, Medicine, Tom)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions effectively leads to Tom being at the cottage with the medicine in the shortest possible way while adhering to the constraints of the story.
