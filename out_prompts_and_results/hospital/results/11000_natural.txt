**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now realizing the urgency, walks to Admissions to assess the other patients.

4. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Ross has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment. Since Ross does not have Jarkis, he dies as well.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young.

7. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Young has Jarkis.

8. **Treat Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment. Since Young does not have Jarkis, he dies as well.

At the end of these actions, Dr. Hathaway has treated all patients, but unfortunately, due to her mistakes caused by the high workload, all patients have died. However, she has completed her goal of assessing and treating all patients.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing each patient is necessary to determine their condition, even though mistakes are made due to the high workload.
- Treating each patient is essential to fulfill the goal of ensuring all patients receive care, even if the treatments are incorrect.
- Walking between rooms is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach each patient for assessment and treatment.
