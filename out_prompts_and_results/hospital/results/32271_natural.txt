**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients waiting in Admissions, Jones and Ross, who are both experiencing unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can begin the process of diagnosing and treating him.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**  
   - This allows Dr. Hathaway to also assess and treat Ross, ensuring that both patients receive care.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This is crucial for identifying whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever (symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy. If he has Jarkis, this would be a mistake, but the workload is still low enough to avoid errors.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross in Patient Room A.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), this treatment will make him healthy. If he has Flaze, this would be a mistake, but again, the workload is manageable.

10. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**  
    - Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to check on Young, ensuring all patients are accounted for.

11. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
    - This final assessment is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide treatment.

12. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
    - Assuming Young has a fever, this treatment will make him healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients effectively. The sequence allows for the admission of patients, assessment of their symptoms, and appropriate treatment based on the diseases and symptoms presented. The actions are structured to avoid exceeding the doctor's workload, which could lead to mistakes in diagnosis.
