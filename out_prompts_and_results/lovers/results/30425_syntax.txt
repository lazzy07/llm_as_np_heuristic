To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to give them to Blake.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the chocolates and will be happy.
- Casey will have given away the chocolates, but their happiness is not the focus here.
- Alex's happiness is not directly affected by these actions, but they are still supportive of Blake.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as the chocolates, allowing for the next action to occur.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: This action directly gives Blake the item they want, thus achieving Blake's goal of happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:
