Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows that her safety and the safety of the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, are at risk. Despite the danger, Zoe has successfully made peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship. 

To ensure both their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and plan her next steps. Although this action might anger the Lizard, she believes it is the best choice for both of them at this moment.

**Action:**
- teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)

**Explanation:**
This action is taken because Zoe prioritizes her safety and the safety of the Lizard. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the eruption of the volcano and potentially return later to help the Lizard or continue building their friendship from a safe distance.
