To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and prefers to be at the Market. This action moves the Bandit away from Tom, reducing the risk of confrontation.

3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard is at the Market and believes the Bandit is at the Crossroads. This action allows the Guard to move towards the Bandit, but since the Bandit is already at the Market, this action does not affect Tom's goal.

4. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: Tom returns to the Crossroads to ensure he is not in the same location as the Bandit or the Guard.

5. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks back to the Cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

The actions are necessary to ensure that Tom can safely reach the Cottage without being attacked or confronted by the Bandit or the Guard. The Bandit moves to the Market, which keeps her away from Tom, and the Guard's actions do not interfere with Tom's goal.
