To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to pick up the item they want.
   
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, which will help them be happy.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially trade items.

4. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just picked up for the jewelry (I1) that Blake has. This is necessary because it allows Alex to receive the item they want.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
