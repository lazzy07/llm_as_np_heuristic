The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She knows that the merchant is dead and that the guard is distracted. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads, where she sees the hero. The bandit then decides to rob the hero, who is unarmed and carrying only a coin. 

The bandit approaches Tom and demands his coin. Tom, believing he is at the crossroads and that the bandit is a threat, reluctantly hands over his coin to avoid conflict. The bandit now has one more coin, which she can add to the chest at her camp.

With her goal of carrying as many coins as possible achieved, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, satisfied with her haul.
