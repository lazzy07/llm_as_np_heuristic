To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army, being armed and present in the USA, can take the Ark from Indiana Jones. This action is necessary because the US Army wants the Ark, and they are in a position to take it by force.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: After taking the Ark, the US Army can open it. Since Indiana Jones believes the Ark is dangerous, he would not have opened it himself. However, the US Army, believing it is safe, will open it. Given that the Ark is indeed dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it.

At this point, the US Army is dead, and the Ark is still in the possession of Indiana Jones. However, since the Nazis are already dead from their previous action of opening the Ark, the story concludes with the US Army having the Ark (as they took it) and the Nazis being dead.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army takes the Ark from Indiana Jones. This is necessary because the US Army wants the Ark, and they are armed, allowing them to take it by force.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army opens the Ark, believing it to be safe. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement that the US Army has the Ark, but it results in their demise due to the Ark being dangerous.

The final outcome is that the US Army has the Ark (though they are dead), and the Nazis are also dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.
