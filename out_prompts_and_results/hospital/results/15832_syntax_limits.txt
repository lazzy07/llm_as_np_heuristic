### Story Completion

After assessing Young in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Young is showing symptoms of Flaze (a fever). However, Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Young receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Young immediately with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

Next, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting. Since Hathaway believes that Jones is alive and healthy, they need to assess Jones to determine if he has any symptoms. After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that Jones is also showing symptoms of Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics as well.
