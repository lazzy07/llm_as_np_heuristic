Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against Bambi, who is also in the forest. 

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat. By shooting Bambi, he can obtain food.
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** This action is the culmination of his decision to shoot. Now that Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain strength and focus on his goal of obtaining money.
4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has the loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba not only satisfies his hunger but also successfully acquires the money he desires.
