To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with Blake and potentially trade items.

2. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This allows both Casey and Blake to be in the same room, facilitating a potential trade.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Blake has. This is crucial because it allows Casey to give Blake what they want (the chocolates) while receiving the jewelry that Alex wants.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
