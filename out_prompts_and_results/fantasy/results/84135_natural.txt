To achieve Vince's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to ensure he acquires the treasure and maintains his happiness. Since Talia and Rory are already married to each other and to Vince, their happiness is not a concern for Vince's goal. The key actions will involve Vince traveling to the cave to acquire the treasure and then returning to the village.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** (This action is necessary for Vince to reach the location of the treasure.)
2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.** (This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which contributes to his wealth.)
3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (This action is necessary for Vince to return to the village with the treasure.)
4. **Vince's wealth increases to 1 (from the treasure).** (This action is implied as a result of picking up the treasure.)
5. **Vince's happiness increases to 1.** (This action is implied as a result of achieving his goal of wealth.)

Now, Vince has the treasure, which makes him wealthy, and he is not hungry since he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave** is essential for Vince to access the treasure.
- **Picking up the treasure** is the key action that fulfills Vince's desire to be wealthy.
- **Traveling back to the village** is necessary for Vince to return to a safe location where he can enjoy his wealth.
- The increase in wealth and happiness is a natural consequence of acquiring the treasure.
