**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment.

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is actually experiencing Unknown, this treatment is a gamble, but it is the only option available at this moment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to and to reduce the workload.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Exam Room B. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway again cannot identify the disease. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway can still make an accurate assessment.

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Again, this is a gamble since Ross is experiencing Unknown.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Exam Room A. This ensures that all patients are being seen and treated.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Young is also experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway can still make an accurate assessment.

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This is another gamble, but it is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated.

In the end, all patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is achieved, despite the uncertainty of their conditions.
