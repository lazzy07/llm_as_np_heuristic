To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit leaves the Market, which reduces the immediate threat to the Merchant and allows her to act without fear of being attacked.

2. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves to the Crossroads, where she can potentially encounter the Bandit or the Guard.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant returns to the Market, where she can continue her business and interact with the remaining characters.

4. **rob(Merchant, TomCoin, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant, now armed with a sword, robs the Bandit, taking the coins that Tom had previously given to the Merchant. This action is possible because the Bandit is not armed with a sword at this moment.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Camp)**: The Merchant then walks back to the Camp, where she can safely store her coins and avoid any further conflict.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to maximize her coins without engaging in criminal behavior, as she only robs the Bandit who is a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking**: The Merchant needs to move to different locations to avoid danger and to find opportunities to acquire coins.
- **Robbing**: This action is crucial for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as she is taking from a known criminal (the Bandit).
