To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are currently not fighting and have a positive relationship, Zoe can initiate a peace agreement with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures a cooperative relationship moving forward.

2. **Zoe walks to the cave**: After making peace, Zoe can walk to the cave to find a safe place away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are safe from the danger on the surface.

3. **Lizard walks to the cave**: Following Zoe, the Lizard can also walk to the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are in a safe location together.

4. **Erupt the volcano**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by moving to the cave.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship.
