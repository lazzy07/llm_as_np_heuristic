To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients in the exam rooms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat more than one patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to assess and treat one patient at a time.

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is found to have Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By focusing on one patient, Hathaway avoids the risk of making a mistake due to an overloaded workload.
