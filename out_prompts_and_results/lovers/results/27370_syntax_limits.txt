In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, while Casey (C2) wants the chocolates (I2) and Blake (C3) wants the flowers (I3). Since Alex is in the same room as Casey and Blake, they can take action to help themselves achieve happiness.

To achieve Alex's goal, the best action is for Alex to give the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2). This action will make Casey happy, and since Alex wants Casey to be happy, it indirectly fulfills Alex's goal as well.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey in the dining room. This makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want (chocolates), and since Alex wants Casey to be happy, Alex also feels fulfilled.

### Explanation of the Action:
