To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to confront Tom and take the coins he has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and has the TomCoin. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin from Tom.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads to head towards the Bandit Camp.

4. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coin she just acquired from Tom and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to reach the Market to interact with Tom. 
- Robbing Tom is essential because it allows the Bandit to acquire the coin without any risk of being attacked, as Tom is unarmed.
- Walking back to the Crossroads is necessary to get to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins.
- Taking the coin to the chest at the Bandit Camp fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins secured.
