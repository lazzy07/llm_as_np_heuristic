In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is in the room with them), and Casey wants item I2 (which is currently unknown). Since Blake is aware that Alex wants I3 and is in the same room, Blake can help Alex achieve happiness by giving them the item they want.

**Story Completion:**
1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because it directly helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness by providing them with the item they want (I3). 

After this action, Alex is happy because they have I3, and Blake is also happy because they helped Alex achieve their goal.

**Explanation of the Action:**
- The action of giving the jewelry (I1) to Alex is the only necessary action to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy. Since Alex's happiness is tied to receiving I3, and Blake has the ability to give I1, this action fulfills both Blake's and Alex's desires.
