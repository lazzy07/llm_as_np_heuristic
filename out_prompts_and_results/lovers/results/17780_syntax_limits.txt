In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the chocolates (I3) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the item they want, which is the jewelry. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) is happy because they have traded for the chocolates (I3), which they do not want but have achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
- Casey (C3) is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2).

This single action fulfills Blake's goal of making Alex happy.
