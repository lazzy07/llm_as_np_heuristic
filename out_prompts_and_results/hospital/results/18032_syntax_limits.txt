In this story, Young is currently in Patient Room B, and Hathaway is also in Patient Room B with a workload of 3. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Patient Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, Hathaway will administer antibiotics for Flaze. If Young has a rash, Hathaway will administer steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to check on the other patients, Jones and Ross. This action is not directly related to Young's health but is necessary for Hathaway to manage their workload and ensure all patients are attended to.
