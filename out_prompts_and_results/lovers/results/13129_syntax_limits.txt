In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, the following action will help Casey achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey (C3) will trade the item they have (the flowers, I1) with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R21). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, which is the item they want to be happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3), making them happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I1), which is not what Blake wants, but since Casey is happy, Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy is still indirectly supported.

Thus, Casey achieves their goal of happiness through this trade.
