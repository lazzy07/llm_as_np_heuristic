Zoe stands on the dangerous surface of the planet, aware of the erupting volcanoes around her. She knows she needs to find a way to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's safety while also making a friend. 

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** This action is necessary to initiate a conversation and establish a connection, as they are currently not fighting and can potentially become friends.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard agree to leave the surface together.** This action ensures that both characters prioritize their safety by moving away from the dangerous environment of the erupting surface.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action takes them to a safer location where they can continue to build their friendship without the immediate threat of the volcano.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** This final action solidifies their relationship, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with another creature.
