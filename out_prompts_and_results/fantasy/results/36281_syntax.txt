To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, she can marry either of them. Marrying will make her happy, which is one of her goals. 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be with Talia and Vince.
   - This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Talia to propose marriage again.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia in the cave.
   - This action is crucial as it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village.
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness but helps maintain the story's flow and keeps Vince in the narrative.

4. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry.
   - This action is included to set up the potential for Gargax to eat Vince, which could create tension in the story.

5. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince.
   - This action is included to show the consequences of Gargax's hunger and to remove Vince from the story, which simplifies the relationships.

After these actions, Talia is married to Rory, which makes her happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling**: Rory and Vince need to be in the same location as Talia to interact with her. 
- **Marrying**: This is the key action that directly leads to Talia's happiness.
- **Getting Hungry and Eating**: These actions are included to create a narrative arc and show the consequences of Gargax's desires, but they do not affect Talia's happiness directly.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)",
    "travel(Vince, Cave, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Gargax)",
    "eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures Talia achieves her goal of happiness through marriage while also providing a narrative that includes all characters and their motivations.
