To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard take actions that lead to the volcano erupting, while also ensuring they become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano starts to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to put aside their differences and become friends. This action is crucial as it fulfills their goal of making friends with each other.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which will lead to the death of one of the characters. This action is necessary to conclude the story with a character dying.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard dies as a result of the eruption. This action is included to ensure that the story ends with a character dying, as required.

The final sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends before the eruption occurs. 

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt**: Initiates the volcanic eruption, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **make_peace**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **erupt**: Executes the eruption, leading to the climax of the story.
- **kill**: Finalizes the story with the Lizard's death due to the eruption.
