To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe needs to return to the surface to interact with the Lizard and establish a friendship. This action is necessary because she cannot make friends while on the ship.

2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important as it allows her to approach the Lizard directly and initiate a conversation.

3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendly relationship, which is one of her goals.

4. **Walk from Cave to Surface**: After making peace, Zoe will walk back to the surface with the Lizard. This action signifies their newfound friendship and ensures they are both safe together.

5. **Erupt (Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends and have moved to the surface together, they can escape the danger.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard.
