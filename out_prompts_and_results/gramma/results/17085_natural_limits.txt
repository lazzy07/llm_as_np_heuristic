In this story, the merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The merchant currently has the medicine and is at the crossroads, while the hero is at the market with one coin. The bandit is also at the crossroads, and the guard is at the market.

To achieve her goal, the merchant can take the following action:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.** This action allows the merchant to be in the same location as the hero, who has a coin. By being at the market, the merchant can potentially buy the coin from the hero, thus increasing her wealth without committing any crimes.

This single action is sufficient for the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins while remaining within the bounds of legality.
