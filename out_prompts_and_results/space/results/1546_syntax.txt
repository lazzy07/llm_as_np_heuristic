To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe is currently in the cave. She needs to go to the surface to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact further.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she can make peace with the Lizard. This action will solidify their friendship, as they are no longer fighting and have a positive relationship.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action will lead to the death of one of the characters on the surface.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: Since the Lizard is on the surface when the volcano erupts, it will die as a result of the eruption.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the surface where the Lizard is located, allowing for further interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is crucial for establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action triggers the volcano eruption, which is a key event in the story.
- **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: This action represents the consequence of the eruption, resulting in the Lizard's death.
