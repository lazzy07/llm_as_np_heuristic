**Story Completion:**

As day one progresses, Ernest finishes his chores in the laundry room and realizes that he needs to protect himself and Roy from the bully. He decides to take action. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape and that he and Roy can confront him safely.)
3. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (Roy joins Ernest in the hallway, ensuring they can work together against the bully.)
4. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action allows Roy to disguise himself, preparing for a potential escape if needed.)

With the gym locked, the bully is trapped inside, and both Ernest and Roy are now in a position to confront him without the immediate threat of violence. They can plan their next move, whether it be to negotiate or to escape together.
