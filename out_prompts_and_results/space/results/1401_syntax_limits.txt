Zoe, having just made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano's imminent eruption. She decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. 

1. **Erupt the volcano**: Zoe knows that the volcano is about to erupt and that it poses a threat to the Lizard, who is currently on the surface.
