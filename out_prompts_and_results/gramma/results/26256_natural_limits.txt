The bandit, believing that the hero is at the cottage, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the cottage to the crossroads, where she encounters the guard and the merchant. The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant as an easy target since the merchant is not armed. 

1. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the hero's coin. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
2. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her newly acquired coin in the chest.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying coins.
