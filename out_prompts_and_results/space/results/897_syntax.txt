To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano, which is a key event in the story.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to be closer to the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.
3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard also walks to the cave, allowing both characters to be in the same location and facilitating their interaction.
4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace, which allows them to become friends despite the dangerous situation.
5. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts, which will result in the death of one character. Since Zoe is in the cave and the eruption occurs on the surface, the Lizard, who is on the surface, will die.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends before the eruption.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe closer to the Lizard, setting the stage for their interaction.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: Ensures the Lizard is also present in the cave, allowing for the peace-making action.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, resulting in the Lizard's death.
