Tom, having looted the medicine from the merchant, realizes he needs to get back to the cottage to use it. He knows the bandit is nearby and could pose a threat. To ensure his safety, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard, who is also at the market.

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is necessary because it alerts the guard to the presence of a criminal, which aligns with the guard's goal of eliminating criminals. This also provides Tom with a sense of security, as the guard will likely take action against the bandit.

2. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.** This action is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

With these two actions, Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, ensuring he can use it as intended.
