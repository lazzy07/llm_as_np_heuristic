In this story, we want to ensure that Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we need to take actions that will allow Hathaway to assess and treat Ross effectively.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if he treats without assessing first. By assessing, Hathaway can accurately identify whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

- **Action 1**: `assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB)`. This action is taken to determine Ross's symptoms accurately, which is essential for providing the correct treatment. 
- **Action 2**: `treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomB)`. This action is taken to treat Ross based on the symptoms identified in the previous step, ensuring that he receives the appropriate care to become healthy.

By following these two actions, Ross will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
