To ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure that they receive the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Casey (C3) wants. This action is necessary because Blake wants to make Alex happy, and by trading the jewelry for the chocolates, they can help Casey achieve their goal.

2. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) will give the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1). This action is included because it allows Casey to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy by giving the chocolates to Alex, who wants the flowers (I1).

3. **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) will put down the flowers (I3) they have in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary to clear the way for the next step.

4. **give(C1, I3, C2, R22)**: Alex (C1) will give the flowers (I3) to Blake (C2). This action is included because it allows Alex to make Blake happy, which is also part of the interconnected happiness of the characters.

After these actions, Casey will have the chocolates, which means they are happy.
