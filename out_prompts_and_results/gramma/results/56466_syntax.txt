To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the stolen coin in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, seeing Tom in the Market, decides to rob him. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit successfully takes the coin from him.
- With the coin in hand, the Bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store the coin in the chest, achieving her goal.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
