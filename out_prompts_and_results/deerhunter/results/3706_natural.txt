To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the forest, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The clerk is at the bank with 1 money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will allow Bubba to achieve his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to reach the clerk to steal the money.)
3. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to take the money.)
4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **Deciding to steal the money**: This action aligns with Bubba's goal of wanting to have money. It sets the intention for the subsequent actions.
2. **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to execute the theft.
3. **Shooting the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money, as it eliminates the clerk's ability to resist.
4. **Picking up the money**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to steal money",
    "go from forest to bank",
    "shoot clerk with rifle",
    "pick up money from clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of having 1 money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
