To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to either shoot Bambi or intimidate the bank clerk to get the money.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

3. **Bubba shoots the bank clerk.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only character with money. Since Bubba is hungry and wants to eat, he can also take the money from the clerk after shooting.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving the goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Load ammunition into the rifle:** Essential for Bubba to be able to shoot.
- **Go to the bank:** Necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and access the money.
