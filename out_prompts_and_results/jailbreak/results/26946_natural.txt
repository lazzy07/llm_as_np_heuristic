3. **Roy crawls back through the vents to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to return to the gym where the bully is, now armed with the knife.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring his and Ernest's survival while also allowing him to escape the prison. The sequence of sneaking to the kitchen, arming himself, and confronting the bully is crucial to eliminate the immediate threat. Locking the gym door ensures that the bully cannot retaliate or escape, and finally, putting on the civilian clothes and escaping is the culmination of Roy's efforts to achieve freedom.
