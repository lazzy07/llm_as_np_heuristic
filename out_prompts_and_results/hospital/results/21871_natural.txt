Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, he is able to accurately assess Jones without making a mistake. He discovers that Jones is experiencing a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.
