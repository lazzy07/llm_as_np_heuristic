To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Merchant walks to the Bandit Camp to confront the Bandit and potentially negotiate or take advantage of the situation.

2. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: The Merchant, armed with a sword, robs the Bandit of the coins she has. This action is taken because the Merchant needs to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, and since the Bandit is a criminal, this action is justified.
