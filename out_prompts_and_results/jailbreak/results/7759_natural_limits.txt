**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Roy stood in the hallway, contemplating his next move. He knew that Ernest was in the laundry room, and the bully was in the gym, still furious about the stolen cigarettes. Roy had a plan to help both himself and Ernest.

Roy decided to sneak into the kitchen to grab the knife. He knew that if he could get the knife, he could confront the bully and protect both himself and Ernest from the bully's threats. 

After successfully sneaking into the kitchen and taking the knife, Roy moved back to the hallway. He then locked the gym door, trapping the bully inside. With the bully now unable to escape, Roy felt a surge of confidence. 

With the knife in hand, Roy entered the gym. The bully, surprised and enraged, lunged at Roy, but Roy was ready. In a swift motion, he defended himself and killed the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest would no longer be threatened.

With the bully gone, Roy returned to the hallway, put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, and made his way to the highway. Disguised and free, he escaped from the prison, achieving his goal of survival and freedom.
