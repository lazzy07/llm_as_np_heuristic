Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of another patient. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload remains manageable.

Finally, Hathaway returns to Exam Room A to assess Young again. Young is now showing symptoms of a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him as well.

With both patients treated and healthy, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
