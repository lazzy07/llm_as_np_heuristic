In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. After eating both Talia and Vince, Gargax travels back to the cave with the money he took from Vince. To achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, Gargax will pick up the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave, which fulfills his desire for wealth.
