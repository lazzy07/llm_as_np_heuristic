The bandit, armed with both the bandit's sword and the merchant's sword, sees the guard at the market. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her plans, she decides to take action. The bandit approaches the guard and attacks him with the bandit's sword, successfully killing him. With the guard out of the way, the bandit loots the guard's corpse, taking his coins. Now, with the coins she has acquired, the bandit returns to her camp, where she can safely store her newfound wealth.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the guard**: The bandit attacks the guard because he poses a significant threat to her safety and her goal of acquiring coins. Since the guard is not armed, the bandit can successfully kill him.
2. **Loot the guard's corpse**: After killing the guard, the bandit loots his body to take his coins, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
