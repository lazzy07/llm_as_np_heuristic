To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry, and Blake currently has it. By giving the jewelry to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Casey to be closer to the action, potentially setting up for future interactions.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but allows Blake to be in a different room, possibly to find the chocolates later.

4. **Casey picks up the flowers from Alex.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but allows Casey to achieve happiness by obtaining the flowers, which they want.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the jewelry and is happy, while Blake and Casey can pursue their own happiness with the chocolates and flowers, respectively.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Blake gives the jewelry to Alex",
    "Casey moves from the living room to the dining room",
    "Blake moves from the dining room to the living room",
    "Casey picks up the flowers from Alex"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry, while also allowing the other characters to pursue their own happiness.
