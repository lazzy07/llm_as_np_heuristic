Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She understands that the Lizard is the guardian of the surface and that they need to work together to survive the eruption. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and address the situation directly, as she believes the surface is dangerous and wants to help the Lizard.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the previous actions. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

4. **Zoe teleports to the ship.** - This action allows Zoe to escape the eruption safely. The Lizard, now a friend, can also find a way to safety, but Zoe must prioritize her own safety first.

5. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard, having established a friendship with Zoe, can now seek refuge in the cave, which is a safer location away from the eruption.
