In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are currently in the possession of Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the flowers from Casey. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex suggests a trade with Casey, offering the jewelry (I3) that they have for the flowers (I1). Since Casey wants the jewelry (I3) and is willing to trade the flowers (I1), this action allows Alex to obtain the flowers they desire.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Alex to acquire the item they want (flowers) while giving Casey an item they desire (jewelry). This satisfies both characters' goals and leads to Alex's happiness.
