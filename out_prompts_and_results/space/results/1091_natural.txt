Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is taken because the cave is a safer location compared to the surface, which is currently dangerous due to the volcano. By walking together, they reinforce their friendship and work towards their mutual goal of safety.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard enter the cave.** This action is necessary to ensure both characters are out of danger from the erupting volcano. The cave provides shelter and a safe space for them to continue their friendship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in a safe location helps solidify their relationship and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to stay in the cave until the danger passes.** This action is implied as they both agree to remain in the cave, ensuring their safety and allowing them to continue building their friendship.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
