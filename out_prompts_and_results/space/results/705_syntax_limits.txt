Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and is in danger due to the erupting volcano. Understanding that the Lizard is also seeking safety and friendship, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship. 

Zoe walks out of the cave and heads to the surface, where she finds the Lizard. Instead of attacking or teleporting, she approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, hoping to convince the Lizard that they can work together to ensure their mutual safety.

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe leaves the cave to find the Lizard on the surface, as she knows that they need to be in the same location to make peace.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship that aligns with both of their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

By making peace, Zoe achieves her goal of forming a friendship with the Lizard, ensuring both of their safety from the erupting volcano.
