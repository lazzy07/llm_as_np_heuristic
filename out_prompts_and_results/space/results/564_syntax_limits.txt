Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface is beginning to erupt, which poses a danger to both of them. 

To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, which makes the Lizard angry because it feels abandoned. The Lizard, feeling threatened by the eruption and Zoe's sudden departure, decides to attack Zoe. However, Zoe, realizing the danger of the volcano, quickly stuns the Lizard to prevent any further conflict. 

While the Lizard is stunned, Zoe teleports back to the surface to escape the impending eruption. Unfortunately, the volcano erupts just as Zoe arrives, and the Lizard, still stunned in the cave, is caught in the eruption and dies. 

Despite the tragic outcome, Zoe reflects on her experience and realizes that she and the Lizard had formed a bond, even if it was brief. She vows to remember the Lizard as a friend.
