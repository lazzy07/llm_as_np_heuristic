In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She is currently married to both Rory and Vince, which means she has the potential for happiness. However, her wealth is only 1, and she needs to increase it to achieve her goal.

To achieve her goal, Talia can take the following action:

1. **Talia takes the money from Vince.** This action is necessary because Talia currently has 1 wealth (from the treasure) and needs to increase her wealth to 2 to feel wealthy. By taking the money from Vince, she will achieve her goal of being wealthy.

After this action, Talia will have 2 wealth, which fulfills her desire to be wealthy. Since she is already married to both Rory and Vince, she will also be happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Talia takes the money from Vince:** This action directly increases Talia's wealth from 1 to 2, allowing her to achieve her goal of being wealthy. Since she is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action also ensures that she remains happy.
