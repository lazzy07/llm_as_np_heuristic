To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory will travel to the cave to find the treasure. This action is necessary because the treasure is located in the cave, and Rory needs to acquire it to increase their wealth.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory will pick up the treasure from the cave. This action is essential for Rory to achieve their goal of being wealthy, as the treasure will significantly increase their wealth.

After these actions, Rory will have the treasure, which fulfills their goal of being wealthy. Since Rory is already happy from marrying Talia and is not hungry (as they have not taken any actions that would make them hungry), they will have achieved all their goals.
