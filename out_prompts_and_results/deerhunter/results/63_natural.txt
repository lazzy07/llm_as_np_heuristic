To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 0 money. Since he already has 0 money, he does not need to take any further actions to change his financial status. The story can conclude with Bubba remaining in the forest, satisfied with his current state.

Here’s the completed story:

1. Bubba decides to eat Bambi. (Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, so he can eat her.)
2. Bubba eats Bambi. (This action satisfies Bubba's hunger.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating will fulfill that need. It also aligns with the story's context, as Bambi is now dead.
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action directly satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to feel content without needing to pursue any further actions related to money.

Since Bubba's goal is to have 0 money, and he already has that, he does not need to take any actions to acquire money or change his financial status. The story ends with Bubba having achieved his goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

  "plan": ["decide to eat Bambi", "eat Bambi"]
