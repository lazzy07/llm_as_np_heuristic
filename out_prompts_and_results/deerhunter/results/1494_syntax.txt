To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle and is hungry, while the bank clerk is in the bank with some money. Bambi is also in the forest, and since she wants to be alive, she will not take any actions that would lead to her death.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat her. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the kill.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action fulfills the condition of Bubba having the money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Shooting Bambi**: This is the first step to either achieving the goal of Bubba having money or Bambi being dead. Since Bambi is a deer and Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot her.
  
- **Eating Bambi**: This action helps Bubba satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi, which is a natural progression for a character in a survival scenario.

- **Going to the Bank**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money, which is his goal.

- **Stealing from the Clerk**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money, completing the story.
