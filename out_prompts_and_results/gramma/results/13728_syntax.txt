To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action ensures that the bandit has coins stored safely, further achieving her goal.

The sequence of actions is designed to maximize the bandit's coin count while ensuring she is not caught by the guard or merchant. The bandit successfully robs Tom, moves to her camp, and secures her coins.
