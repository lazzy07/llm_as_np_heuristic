**Story Completion:**

After Hathaway walks to the admissions room, she decides to admit Young to exam room B. This action increases her workload to 2, but she is still able to manage her patients effectively.

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room A. She finds that Ross has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Since her workload is still manageable, she correctly identifies the disease.

Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.
