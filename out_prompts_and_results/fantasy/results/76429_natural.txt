To complete the story, we need to ensure that Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry. Gargax currently has the money but needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. The following actions will help Gargax achieve their goal:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location of the treasure.

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, which contributes to their wealth.

3. **Gargax travels from the cave back to the village.**  
   - This action is needed for Gargax to return to the village after obtaining the treasure.

4. **Gargax eats Talia.**  
   - This action ensures that Gargax is not hungry anymore, as Gargax's hunger is currently at 0, and eating Talia will fulfill their hunger requirement.

After these actions, Gargax will have both the money and the treasure, achieving their goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Travel to the cave:** Gargax needs to go to the cave to get the treasure.
