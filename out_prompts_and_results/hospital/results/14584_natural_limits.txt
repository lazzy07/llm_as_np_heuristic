1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, Jones and Young.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.** This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not be able to identify the disease yet.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.** Similar to the previous action, this allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is also experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.
