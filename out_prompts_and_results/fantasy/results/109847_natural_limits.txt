In the cave, Gargax, feeling hungry, sees Talia and Rory. To satisfy his hunger, Gargax decides to eat Rory, who is at the cave. After eating Rory, Gargax now has a human's wealth and is no longer hungry. Talia, now alone in the cave with Gargax, realizes that she has the treasure and that Gargax is wealthy. 

To achieve her goal of becoming wealthy, Talia decides to take the money from Vince's body, as he is still at the village. She travels back to the village, picks up the money from Vince's body, and returns to the cave. Now, Talia has both the treasure and the money, making her wealthy.
