**Story Completion:**

After Ernest finishes his chores in the kitchen, he realizes he needs to act quickly to secure his safety and get the pack of cigarettes back from the bully. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, so he decides to take a risk.

1. **Go to Hallway**: Ernest moves from the kitchen to the hallway to get closer to the gym where the bully is located. This action is necessary to position himself for the next steps.

2. **Lock Gym**: Once in the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door. This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference. This action is crucial for Ernest's safety.

3. **Vent to Gym**: Ernest crawls through the vents to enter the gym. This allows him to bypass the locked door and confront the bully directly. 

4. **Kill Bully**: Inside the gym, Ernest uses the knife he stole earlier to kill the bully. This action eliminates the threat the bully poses to him and Roy, allowing them to be safe.

5. **Go to Laundry**: After dealing with the bully, Ernest moves to the laundry room to retrieve the civilian clothes. This is necessary for his escape plan.

6. **Disguise with Clothes**: Ernest puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This is essential for blending in and avoiding detection as he makes his escape.

7. **Go to Highway**: Finally, Ernest moves from the laundry room to the highway. This is the last step before he can escape the prison.

8. **Escape**: Ernest successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
