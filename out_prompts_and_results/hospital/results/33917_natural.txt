**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, assesses Young and confirms that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating Jarkis. Given that Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but since Young's symptoms are clear, Hathaway decides to treat Young for Jarkis with steroids.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Young becomes healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones and Ross, who are still in Admissions. Since both patients are experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A and Jones to Patient Room B. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room A, but due to the workload being 2, there is still a risk of confusion. However, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross is experiencing a fever, indicating Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones is also experiencing a fever, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics as well, and Jones becomes healthy.

At this point, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.
