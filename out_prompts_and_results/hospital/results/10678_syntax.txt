To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat more than one patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first assess one patient, treat them, and then move on to the next patient.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This action is necessary to avoid a mistake due to the high workload.
   
2. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial for ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to return to the admissions room to assess and treat the next patient.

4. **Admit Ross to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will admit Ross to an exam room to prepare for his assessment.

5. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified.
