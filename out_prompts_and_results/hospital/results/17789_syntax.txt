To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the exam room, this is a necessary step to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young based on the identified symptoms. If Young has a fever, they will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, or if they have a rash, they will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Hathaway from PatientRoomC to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are currently waiting there.

4. **Admit Jones to PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will admit Jones to PatientRoomA. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated.

5. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is essential to identify the correct treatment for Jones.

6. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomA**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

7. **Admit Ross to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will admit Ross to PatientRoomB. This allows Hathaway to assess and treat Ross as well.

8. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Ross.
