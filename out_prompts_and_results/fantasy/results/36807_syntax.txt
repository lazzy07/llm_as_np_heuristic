To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to obtain money and ensure he is not hungry. Since Rory is currently in the Cave with Talia and Gargax, and Vince is in the Village with the Money, the best course of action is for Rory to travel to the Village, take the Money from Vince, and then return to the Cave. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village to reach Vince, who has the Money. This is necessary for Rory to obtain the Money he desires.
  
2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the Money from Vince. This action is crucial as it allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of his goals.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the Cave with the Money. This is necessary for him to be in the same location as Talia, who he has a relationship with.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger status is updated, as he needs to be aware of his hunger level.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story, as it leads to Rory's demise, but it is a necessary part of the narrative.

After these actions, Rory has achieved his goal of being wealthy (by obtaining the Money), but he is no longer alive, which is a consequence of Gargax's action. However, the focus is on Rory's wealth and the actions taken to achieve it.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)",
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goal of wealth, even though it leads to his demise.
