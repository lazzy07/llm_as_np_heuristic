To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and head to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

2. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon reaching the surface, Zoe feels threatened by the Lizard's presence and decides to attack. This action is taken to create a conflict that can lead to a resolution later.

3. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard, in response to Zoe's attack, stuns her. This action is necessary to shift the dynamics of their interaction and create an opportunity for peace later.

4. **break_free(Zoe, Surface)**: After being stunned, Zoe manages to break free. This action allows her to regain her agency and continue interacting with the Lizard.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: With the tension from the fight resolved, Zoe and the Lizard decide to make peace. This action is crucial for them to become friends, aligning with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts. This action is the climax of the story, resulting in the danger that was present on the surface becoming lethal.

7. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: As the volcano erupts, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and dies. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

In summary, the actions taken lead to a conflict that is resolved through peace, but ultimately results in the Lizard's demise due to the volcanic eruption. This sequence of events satisfies the conditions of the story while ensuring that both characters' goals are addressed.
