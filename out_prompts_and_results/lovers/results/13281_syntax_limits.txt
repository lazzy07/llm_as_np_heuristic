In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Since Alex is already happy (having received the item they wanted, which is the jewelry), Blake can focus on making Casey happy. 

To achieve this, Blake can tell Casey that they want the chocolates (which is true), and since Casey is currently unhappy and wants the chocolates, this will motivate Casey to take action to obtain them. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(Blake, Casey, I2, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates. This action is necessary because it informs Casey of Blake's desire, which can lead to a potential exchange or action that will make Casey happy.

After this action, Casey will understand that Blake wants the chocolates, and since Casey wants to make Blake happy, they will likely take steps to ensure Blake's happiness, thus indirectly achieving Blake's goal of being happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["tell(Blake, Casey, I2, R21)"]
}
``` 

This single action is sufficient to set the stage for Casey to pursue their happiness, which aligns with Blake's goal of ensuring Alex's happiness as well.
