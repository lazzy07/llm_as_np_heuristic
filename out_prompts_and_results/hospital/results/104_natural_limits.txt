Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, first assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Upon assessment, Hathaway confirms that Ross is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him of the disease. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B and confirms the diagnosis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Jones. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway is cautious but decides to treat him with antibiotics, believing it might be Flaze. Unfortunately, this is a mistake, and Jones dies. However, Hathaway has successfully treated both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring that the majority of patients are healthy.
