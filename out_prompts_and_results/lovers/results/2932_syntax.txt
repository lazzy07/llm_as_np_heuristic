To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to trade items with Casey.

2. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be in the same room as Blake. This is essential for the trade to occur.

3. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I3) for the jewelry (I2) with Casey in the dining room. This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to conclude the story with Casey in a different room.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they now possess the jewelry they wanted.
