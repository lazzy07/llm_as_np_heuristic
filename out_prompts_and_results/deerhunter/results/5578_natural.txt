Bubba is currently at the forest, hungry and wanting to have money. The only way for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money is to steal it from the bank clerk, who is at the bank with 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to reach the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba can eliminate the clerk, ensuring he can take the money without resistance.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, achieving his goal.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a direct action to eliminate any threat and secure the money.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
