To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is already in the Forest and has previously gone to the Bank. He needs to return to the Bank to confront the Clerk and obtain the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba is at the Bank, he can use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action will ensure that the Clerk is dead, and Bubba can take the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the Bank, achieving his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and it also results in Bambi being alive since Bubba does not interact with Bambi in this scenario.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the Clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money after the Clerk has been dealt with.
