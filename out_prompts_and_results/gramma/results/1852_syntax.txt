To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is essential for her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action is necessary to ensure that she has the coins stored safely, thus achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain coins directly from Tom, who is currently vulnerable after the attack on the Merchant.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a secure location where she can store her coins safely.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
