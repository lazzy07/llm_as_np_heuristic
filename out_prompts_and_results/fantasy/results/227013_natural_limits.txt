In the cave, Rory, who has the treasure, realizes that he needs to ensure his happiness and wealth. Since he is already married to Talia, he decides to take action to secure his wealth. He approaches Gargax, the dragon, and proposes a deal: he will give Gargax the treasure in exchange for some of Gargax's wealth. Gargax, wanting to be wealthy and not hungry, agrees to the deal. Rory hands over the treasure to Gargax, and in return, Gargax gives Rory some of his wealth. 

This action is necessary because it allows Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy and happy. By trading the treasure, Rory increases his wealth, which contributes to his happiness.
