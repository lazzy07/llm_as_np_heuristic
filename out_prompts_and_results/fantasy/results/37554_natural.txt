To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human and Rory is the only human present. By eating Rory, Gargax will satisfy their hunger, and Rory will no longer be alive, which will allow Rory to achieve happiness through the fulfillment of their desires in a different way (as they are now free from the struggles of life).

2. **Rory takes the treasure from Rory's dead body**: After Gargax eats Rory, Rory's body is now dead. Vince can take the treasure from Rory's dead body, which will increase Vince's wealth.

3. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince, who is now wealthy after taking the treasure, can propose to Talia. This action is necessary for Vince to achieve happiness.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which makes both of them happy.

5. **Talia and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies their happiness as a couple.

In this sequence, Rory achieves their goal of happiness through the fulfillment of their desires, even though it comes at the cost of their life. The actions taken are necessary to ensure that Rory's goals are met, while also allowing Vince and Talia to find happiness through marriage.
