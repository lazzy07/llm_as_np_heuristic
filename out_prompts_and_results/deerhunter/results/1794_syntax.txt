To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already at the bank and has loaded a rifle, he can use intimidation to achieve his goal. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any resistance and take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the clerk's money, and the clerk is the only obstacle in his way.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it allows Bubba to fulfill his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to remove the bank clerk as an obstacle and to ensure Bubba can take the money without any interference.
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to collect the money he desires after eliminating the clerk.
