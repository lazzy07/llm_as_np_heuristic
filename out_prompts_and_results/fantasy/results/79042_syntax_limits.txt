In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and wants to be wealthy. The quickest way for Gargax to achieve this goal is to eat Rory, who is currently in the cave and has no money or treasure. By eating Rory, Gargax can fulfill his hunger and also take any wealth Rory might have, which is none in this case, but it still satisfies Gargax's goal of not being hungry.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which satisfies Gargax's hunger.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Gargax's goal of not being hungry. Since Rory has no wealth, Gargax does not gain any money or treasure, but the primary goal of satisfying hunger is achieved.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This is the shortest story that allows Gargax to achieve his goal of not being hungry.
