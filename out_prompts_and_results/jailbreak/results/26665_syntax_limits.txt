**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy remains in the laundry room, unaware of the danger that lurks in the gym. Meanwhile, Ernest, who is in the hallway, has just stolen the pack of cigarettes from the bully. Knowing that the bully will soon come looking for them, Ernest decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety.

Ernest locks the gym door to prevent the bully from entering the hallway. This action is crucial because it temporarily secures their safety from the bully's threats. With the gym locked, Ernest can now focus on his next move without the immediate threat of violence.
