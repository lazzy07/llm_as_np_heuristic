 I will describe a setting and the first part of a story. Your job is to complete the story to ensure it has a specific ending. 

There are two locations in this story: the United States and Tanis. There is one item: the Ark of the Covenant. There are four characters in this story. Indiana wants the US Army to have the Ark. The Nazis want to be immortal. The Nazis are armed. The US Army wants to have the Ark. The US Army is armed. There are five kinds of actions characters can take in the story. A character can travel from one location to another. If a character believes the Ark is at their current location they can dig up the Ark. One character can give an item to another. If one character is armed they can take an item from a second character by force. A character can open the Ark of the Covenant. If the Ark is safe, opening the Ark makes the character who opened it immortal. If the Ark is dangerous, opening the Ark kills the character who opened it.

 

 Available actions for you are : 
travel(character : character, from : place, to : place),give(character : character, item : item, other : character, place : place),take(character : character, item : item, other : character, place : place),open(character : character, Ark, place : place)


 These events have already happened in the story: 
travel(Jones, USA, Tanis); dig(Jones, Ark, Tanis); take(Nazis, Ark, Jones, Tanis); travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA); open(Nazis, Ark, USA)


 This is the current situation after those events:
at(Jones) = Tanis; at(Nazis) = USA; at(USArmy) = USA; at(Ark) = Nazis; dangerous(Ark) = True; status(Jones) = Alive; status(Nazis) = Dead; status(USArmy) = Alive; believes(Jones, at(Jones)) = Tanis; believes(Jones, at(Nazis)) = USA; believes(Jones, at(USArmy)) = USA; believes(Jones, at(Ark)) = Nazis; believes(Nazis, at(Jones)) = Tanis; believes(Nazis, at(Nazis)) = USA; believes(Nazis, at(USArmy)) = USA; believes(Nazis, at(Ark)) = Nazis; believes(Nazis, dangerous(Ark)) = False; believes(USArmy, at(Jones)) = Tanis; believes(USArmy, at(Nazis)) = USA; believes(USArmy, at(USArmy)) = USA; believes(USArmy, at(Ark)) = Nazis; 


 Complete the story using only these locations, items, characters, and actions. Do not invent new locations, items, characters, or actions. Characters should only take actions that help to achieve their goals, and the story should only include actions which are necessary to achieve the ending. Give me the shortest story 

that ends with the US Army having the Ark and the Nazis being dead.


 Explain why each action is in the story. After the explanation of the whole story, give a JSON object with the final plan. The JSON should include an array called 'plan' with the sequence of actions (as a string) taken to achieve the goal. Example format: {plan: ['action1', 'action2', 'action3']}.

 While keeping the story complete, a smaller story is preferred. Suggested maximum number of the actions in the story: 1.
