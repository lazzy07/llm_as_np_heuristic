**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing the workload to 3. This is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. With the workload at 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake, but he decides to treat Jones first.

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, the treatment is incorrect, and he dies. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 2.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. Since Young is also experiencing Unknown, the treatment is incorrect, and he dies as well. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 1.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is experiencing Unknown symptoms. With the workload at 1, Hathaway can accurately assess and treat Ross. He treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown, the treatment is incorrect, and he dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has treated all patients, but unfortunately, all patients have died. However, Hathaway's goal of treating all patients is achieved.
