In the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but she is unhappy and has no wealth. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and has no wealth either. To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the simplest action is for Gargax to eat Vince, as Vince has the money, which will then be available for Talia.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:
