**Story Completion:**

As Ernest stands in the gym, he feels the weight of the bully's threat hanging over him. He knows he needs to act quickly to ensure his survival. Meanwhile, Roy, still in the laundry room, is aware of the danger they are both in due to the bully's anger over the stolen cigarettes.

1. **Ernest decides to sneak through the vents from the gym to the hallway.** This action is crucial because it allows him to escape the immediate threat posed by the bully without confrontation. By moving to the hallway, he can plan his next move without being in the bully's line of sight.

2. **Once in the hallway, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he had previously stolen.** This action is essential as it disguises him, allowing him to blend in and avoid detection. With the disguise, he can safely make his way to the highway and escape the prison.

With these two actions, Ernest successfully avoids the bully's threat and secures his freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Sneaking through the vents allows Ernest to escape the gym without facing the bully directly, which is vital for his safety.
- Putting on the civilian clothes is necessary for disguise, enabling him to escape from the prison without being recognized.
