Zoe stands on the dangerous surface of the planet, aware of the erupting volcano nearby. She knows she needs to ensure her safety and make a friend in the Lizard. Instead of fighting, she decides to approach the Lizard peacefully.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and be safe. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the dangerous situation on the surface.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action is necessary for both characters to find safety from the erupting volcano. The cave provides a secure location away from the danger, allowing them to remain healthy and safe together.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
