In this story, the merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the merchant is at the bandit camp, and the bandit is at the market with the medicine. The merchant has the hero's coin, which is one coin, and the bandit has the medicine, which the hero wants to retrieve.

To achieve her goal, the merchant can take the following action:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the market.** This action allows the merchant to return to the market where she can potentially interact with the bandit and the hero.

After this action, the merchant can then negotiate or attempt to buy the medicine back from the bandit, but since the story only allows for one action, we will stop here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The merchant walking to the market is necessary for her to be in a position to interact with the bandit and potentially acquire more coins or negotiate for the medicine. This action does not make her a criminal and keeps her within her goal of maximizing her coins.
