**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Ernest wakes up in the cell block, feeling the weight of the bully's threat hanging over him. He knows he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's survival. 

1. **Ernest decides to do his chores in the laundry room.** This action is necessary because it allows him to move out of the cell block and into a location where he can potentially find a way to defend himself or help Roy. 

2. **After finishing his chores, Ernest moves to the hallway.** This action is crucial as it gives him access to the vents, allowing him to sneak around the prison without being seen by the bully.

3. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** This action is taken to confront the bully without being directly threatened in the cell block. 

4. **Once in the gym, Ernest locks the gym door.** This action is vital because it prevents the bully from escaping and gives Ernest a moment to strategize.

5. **Ernest finds the knife in the kitchen (which he had previously overlooked) and takes it.** This action is necessary for him to defend himself against the bully.

6. **With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully.** This action is the climax of the story, where Ernest takes a stand against the bully's threats.

7. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** This action resolves the immediate threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to breathe a sigh of relief.

8. **Ernest then goes back to the hallway and puts on the civilian clothes.** This action is taken to disguise himself and prepare for a potential escape.

9. **Finally, Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway and escapes from the prison.** This action ensures that he overcomes the bully's threats and secures his freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to help Ernest navigate the threats posed by the bully while also ensuring his survival. By doing chores, he moves to a more strategic location.
