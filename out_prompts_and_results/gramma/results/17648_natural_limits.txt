The bandit, armed with both the bandit's sword and the merchant's sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She approaches the merchant, who is unarmed and unaware of the bandit's intentions. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the medicine that the merchant is carrying. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit now has what she wanted: to carry as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. The bandit robs the merchant: This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying valuable items (in this case, the medicine) without risking confrontation with the guard, who is also at the market.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal with this single action.
