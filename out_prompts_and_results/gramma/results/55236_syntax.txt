To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine, and by walking to the cottage, he fulfills his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it directly moves Tom from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine. Since he already possesses the medicine, this action completes his objective.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
