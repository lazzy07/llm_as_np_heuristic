To achieve Blake's goal of obtaining the chocolates, we need to ensure that the characters take actions that lead to Blake being happy. The following sequence of actions will accomplish this:

1. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Casey to leave the bathroom and potentially find the chocolates, which are currently unknown to all characters.

2. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to acquire the chocolates, which are now in the living room. 

3. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Casey returns to the bathroom to interact with Alex and Blake.

4. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake in the bathroom.**  
   - This action allows Blake to receive the chocolates, fulfilling Blake's desire and making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the bathroom with the jewelry.
- Blake is in the bathroom with the chocolates.
- Casey is in the bathroom.
- Alex is not happy (still wants flowers).
- Blake is happy (has chocolates).
- Casey is not happy (still wants jewelry).

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:
