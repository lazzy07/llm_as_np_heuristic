To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the surface to interact with the Lizard and to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important as it allows Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a friendly interaction.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard in the cave. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

4. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk back to the surface. This action is taken to ensure that both characters can be safe from the volcano, which is still a threat.

5. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary for the Lizard to join Zoe and ensure both characters are safe together.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now on the surface, they are safe together. This action concludes the story with both characters achieving their goals of safety and friendship.

The sequence of actions ensures that Zoe and the Lizard can become friends while also avoiding the danger posed by the erupting volcano.
