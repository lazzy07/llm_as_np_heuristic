To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Ross, the first action is to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Young, who is currently there. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated.

4. **Admit Young to an exam room**: Hathaway will admit Young to an exam room (let's say PatientRoomC) to prepare for assessment and treatment.

5. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms, similar to what was done for Ross.

6. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

7. **Walk back to PatientRoomA**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk back to PatientRoomA to check on Jones, who is still in the Admissions room.

8. **Admit Jones to an exam room**: Hathaway will admit Jones to an exam room (let's say PatientRoomB) to prepare for assessment and treatment.

9. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

10. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Treating patients** with the correct treatment is necessary to ensure they recover.
- **Walking between rooms** allows Hathaway to reach the patients who need assessment and treatment.
- **Admitting patients** to exam rooms is necessary for Hathaway to assess and treat them properly.

    "admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)",
