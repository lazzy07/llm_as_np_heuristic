To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to fulfill his goal of being there with the medicine. This action moves him directly to his desired location.

This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal, as he is already carrying the medicine and simply needs to reach the Cottage.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the Cottage with the medicine. Since he is currently at the Crossroads, walking to the Cottage is the most direct and efficient way to achieve his goal.
