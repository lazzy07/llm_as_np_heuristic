Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the ground tremble beneath her feet as the volcano begins to erupt. She knows she must act quickly to ensure her safety and to foster a friendship with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goal of safety. This action is crucial as it solidifies their relationship and ensures they are not enemies, which is essential for both characters to feel safe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe decides to lead the Lizard to the cave, a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to protect both characters from the imminent danger on the surface.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring they both reach safety together. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and mutual goal of safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are safely in the cave, they are unharmed. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions to move to safety.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard further solidify their friendship, ensuring that they can work together in the future. This final action emphasizes their successful relationship and shared goals.

Through these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
