In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is happy with the jewelry. Since Blake has the flowers, he can help himself by giving the flowers to Alex, which will not help Blake achieve his goal. Instead, Blake should focus on getting the chocolates.

Blake decides to tell Casey that the chocolates are in the dining room, which is a lie, but it will prompt Casey to move. 

1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the dining room.** This action is necessary because it misleads Casey, causing her to leave the bathroom in search of the chocolates, which will allow Blake to take the flowers without interference.

After this action, Casey, believing Blake, moves to the dining room to look for the chocolates, leaving Blake alone in the bathroom with Alex. 

2. **Blake picks up the flowers from his possession.** This action is necessary because it allows Blake to finally have the flowers, which he wants.

Now, Blake is happy because he has the flowers, and Casey is still happy with the jewelry. Alex remains unhappy, but Blake has achieved his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the dining room.",
    "Blake picks up the flowers."
  ]
}
