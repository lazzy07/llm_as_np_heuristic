To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to leave the bank with the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk:** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has the only money available.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action is the means by which Bubba can achieve his goal of having money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money.
- **Bubba goes from the bank to the house:** This action is included to signify that Bubba has left the bank after successfully stealing the money, completing his goal.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
