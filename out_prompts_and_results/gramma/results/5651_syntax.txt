To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the TomCoin that Tom has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable after the attack on the Merchant.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then moves to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins safely.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire the coin that Tom has, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins, thus achieving her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
