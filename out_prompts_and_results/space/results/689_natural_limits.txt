Zoe looks around the dangerous surface and realizes that staying here is not safe for either her or the Lizard. She wants to ensure both of them are healthy and safe, so she decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can discuss their next steps in a safer environment. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety and health, as the surface is dangerous. It also allows her to create a plan for future interactions with the Lizard.

2. **Zoe invites the Lizard to teleport to the spaceship.** - Since they are friends, Zoe wants to ensure the Lizard's safety as well. By inviting the Lizard, she can help him escape the dangerous surface.

3. **The Lizard teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action ensures that the Lizard is safe and healthy, just like Zoe. Now, they can both work together to make plans for future exploration and friendship.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also ensuring the Lizard is safe and healthy, fostering their friendship.
