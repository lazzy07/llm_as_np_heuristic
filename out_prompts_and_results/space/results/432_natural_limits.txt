Zoe, feeling safe aboard her spaceship, decides to check on the surface situation. She teleports from the ship to the surface, where she finds the volcano rumbling ominously. The Lizard, sensing the danger, teleports from the cave to the surface to warn Zoe. 

Upon arrival, the Lizard and Zoe realize they need to work together to ensure their safety. They quickly make peace again, reinforcing their friendship. However, as they converse, the volcano erupts unexpectedly, sending lava flowing towards them. In a desperate attempt to escape, Zoe teleports back to the ship, but the Lizard, unable to escape in time, is caught in the eruption and perishes.
