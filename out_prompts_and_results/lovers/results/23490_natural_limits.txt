In the living room, Alex holds the flowers and is happy. Blake, who is not happy, wants the chocolates, and Casey, also not happy, wants the jewelry. To help Blake and Casey achieve their happiness, Alex decides to give the flowers to Casey, believing that this will make Casey happy.

**Action:**
1. Alex gives the flowers to Casey.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it allows Casey to receive the flowers, which Alex believes will make Casey happy. Since Alex is already happy with the flowers, this action does not affect Alex's happiness negatively. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still happy (having achieved their goal).
- Casey is now happy (having received the flowers).
- Blake remains unhappy, but Alex's goal of being happy is achieved.
