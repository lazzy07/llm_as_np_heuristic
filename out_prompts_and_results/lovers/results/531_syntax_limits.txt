In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R12) and has picked up the jewelry (I3). Casey (C3) is in the living room (R22) and wants the jewelry (I3), while Blake (C2) is also in the dining room (R12) and wants the chocolates (I2).

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I2, R12)**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I3) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to give away the item they currently hold (jewelry) to receive the item they want (flowers) indirectly through Blake's happiness. 

After this trade, Blake will be happy because they receive the jewelry they want, and Alex will be able to pursue the flowers in the next steps, ensuring their happiness.
