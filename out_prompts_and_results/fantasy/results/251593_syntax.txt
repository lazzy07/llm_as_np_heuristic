To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she can acquire. The story will unfold as follows:

1. **Talia proposes to Vince**: Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, but she also has a relationship with Vince that is currently proposed. To achieve her goal, she needs to solidify her relationship with Vince, who has money. 

2. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal**: This action will make both Talia and Vince happy, as they are now married.

3. **Talia takes the money from Vince**: Since Talia is now married to Vince, she can take the money he has, which will make her wealthy.

4. **Talia travels to the village**: This action is not strictly necessary for her goal but can be included to signify her return to a familiar place after achieving her wealth.

5. **Talia becomes hungry**: This action is included to show that Talia is not concerned about hunger, aligning with her character's traits.

6. **Talia eats**: This action is included to resolve her hunger, even though she does not care about it.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **propose(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia solidifies her relationship with Vince, who has money.
- **accept(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married, making them both happy.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince, achieving her goal of wealth.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village, signifying her new status.
- **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry, reflecting her character's indifference to hunger.
- **eat(Talia, Talia, Village)**: Talia resolves her hunger, even though it is not a priority for her.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "propose(Vince, Talia, Cave)",
    "accept(Talia, Vince, Cave)",
    "take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)",
    "travel(Talia, Cave, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Talia)",
    "eat(Talia, Talia, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy while adhering to the constraints of the story.
