To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: Tom needs to get away from the crossroads where the bandit is present. He will walk to the bandit camp to avoid any confrontation and to find a safe place to regroup.

2. **take(Tom, Medicine, Chest, Bandit Camp)**: Since Tom is now at the bandit camp, he can safely take the medicine from his own inventory and place it in the chest. This action is necessary to ensure he can carry the medicine without being attacked by the bandit.

3. **walk(Tom, Bandit Camp, Crossroads)**: Tom will then walk back to the crossroads. This is a necessary step to get back on the path to the cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the crossroads to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

The actions are designed to ensure Tom avoids confrontation with the bandit while still achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
