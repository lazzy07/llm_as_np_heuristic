To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk from the Camp to the Crossroads to meet Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads with the Medicine. This action is necessary for the Merchant to interact with Tom and potentially trade.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom using her own coin. This action allows the Merchant to gain an additional coin without resorting to criminal activity.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will then walk back to the Market. This action is necessary for her to be in her preferred location and to continue her business.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, carrying the Medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to fulfill his goal of being at the Cottage with the Medicine.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired an additional coin without engaging in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's first action of walking to the Crossroads is essential to facilitate a transaction with Tom.
- The purchase of the coin from Tom is a direct action that increases the Merchant's wealth while keeping her within legal boundaries.
- Walking back to the Market allows the Merchant to return to her preferred location, where she can continue her business activities.
- Tom's action of walking to the Cottage with the Medicine fulfills his goal, but it does not interfere with the Merchant's success.
