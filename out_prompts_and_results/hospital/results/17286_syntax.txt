To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is important to ensure that both patients are treated appropriately.

3. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing the other two patients, Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room C. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will then assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify the correct treatment for Jones.

5. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This is also necessary for Young to become healthy.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.
