**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, walks to Exam Room A where Jones is located. Since Jones is the only patient in Exam Room A, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 2.

Next, Hathaway walks to Exam Room B where Ross is located. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well. This further reduces Hathaway's workload to 1.

Finally, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Young, who has not yet been assigned to an exam room. After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him. With all patients now healthy, Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
