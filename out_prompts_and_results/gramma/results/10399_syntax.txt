To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his goal.

The other characters (Guard and Bandit) are present at the Crossroads, but they do not take any actions that interfere with Tom's goal. The Bandit is not in a position to attack Tom since Tom is not carrying a sword, and the Guard is not focused on Tom at this moment.

Thus, the story is very straightforward, with only one action needed for Tom to achieve his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to leave the Crossroads, where he currently is, and head directly to the Cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine he looted from the Merchant.
