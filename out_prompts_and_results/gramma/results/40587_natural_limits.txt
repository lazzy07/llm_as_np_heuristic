The story unfolds as follows:

1. The bandit, armed with two swords, decides to rob the merchant at the camp. She walks from the crossroads to the camp, where the merchant is located.
2. The bandit attacks the merchant, killing her and taking the medicine. Now, the bandit has the medicine and the merchant's coins, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
3. The bandit then walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely store her loot.

In this scenario, the merchant does not achieve her goal of collecting coins, but the bandit does. However, since the goal is for the merchant to achieve her goal, we need to adjust the actions.

To ensure the merchant achieves her goal, we can have the following actions:

1. The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads, where she meets the bandit.
2. The merchant offers to sell the medicine to the bandit for the hero's coin. The bandit, wanting to have more coins, agrees and gives the merchant the coin.
3. The merchant now has the coin and the medicine, achieving her goal of collecting coins without becoming a criminal.

The actions are necessary because they allow the merchant to successfully trade the medicine for the coin, fulfilling her desire to collect coins without engaging in criminal activity.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:
