The Secret Agent is determined to eliminate the Mastermind. After finding the gun in the office, the agent knows they must confront the Mastermind before they can carry out their plan. 

1. **Action: move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)** - The Secret Agent moves from the Office to the Lobby, where they believe the Mastermind is located. This action is necessary to get closer to the Mastermind and prepare for the confrontation.

2. **Action: kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)** - Once in the Lobby, the Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind. This action directly achieves the Secret Agent's goal of ensuring the Mastermind is dead.
