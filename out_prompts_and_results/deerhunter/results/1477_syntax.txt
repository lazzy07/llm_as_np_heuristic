To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to get money. He needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located to potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can return to the forest to ensure he is away from the bank and the clerk.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where he can obtain money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of having money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to escape the bank after committing the theft, ensuring he is not caught.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.
