To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, Hathaway will give him steroids. This action is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomB. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is essential to avoid treating Ross incorrectly.

2. **Treat(Ross)**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate medication. If Ross has Flaze, he receives antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he receives steroids. This action is critical to ensure Ross's health and fulfill Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway can ensure that Ross is treated correctly, thus achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
