Zoe and the Lizard are both on the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They have already established a friendly relationship, which is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with other creatures. 

To ensure both characters are safe and to solidify their friendship, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where it is safer from the volcanic activity. This action is necessary to avoid the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it keeps both characters together and safe from the eruption.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they remain allies. It is essential for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are in the cave, they are safe. This action demonstrates the danger of the surface and highlights the importance of their previous actions to ensure safety.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
