**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he has the cigarettes, which he can use as leverage.

1. **Roy moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and use the cigarettes to negotiate safety for both himself and Ernest.)
   
2. **Roy enters the gym and offers the cigarettes to the bully.** (This action is intended to appease the bully and distract him from threatening Ernest, ensuring that both Roy and Ernest remain alive.)

3. **The bully accepts the cigarettes and is momentarily distracted.** (This action allows Roy to buy time and think of a way to protect both himself and Ernest.)

4. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action is crucial as it prevents the bully from leaving and threatening Ernest while also giving Roy a moment to strategize.)

5. **Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen through the vents.** (This action is necessary for Roy to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)

6. **Roy returns to the gym with the knife.** (This action allows Roy to confront the bully directly, ensuring he has the means to protect himself and Ernest.)

7. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is the final step to ensure that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully.)

8. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes and escapes through the highway.** (This action allows Roy to successfully escape the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's survival while eliminating the threat posed by the bully. The sequence of actions is designed to first distract the bully, then secure the environment, and finally confront the bully with the means to protect himself and escape.
