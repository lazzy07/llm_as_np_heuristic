In this story, Young is in exam room B, and Hathaway is currently in the same room. Since Hathaway's workload is at 3, they are at risk of making a mistake. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze; if they have a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This is essential because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the appropriate medication based on the symptoms. This action is vital for Young to recover and achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

The story is kept short with only two actions, ensuring Young's health is prioritized while minimizing the risk of Hathaway making a mistake due to their workload.
