To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money rather than earning it through other means.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will decide to eat, as he is hungry. This action is necessary for Bubba's survival and well-being.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank. This action is included to ensure that he can continue to interact with the bank clerk if needed.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If Bubba feels threatened or if he believes the clerk might report him, he will shoot the clerk. This action is a last resort to eliminate any risk of being caught after stealing the money.

6. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, if Bubba encounters Bambi in the forest, he will eat her. This action is included to satisfy his hunger and ensure he has food.

The story ends with Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money and satisfying his hunger.
