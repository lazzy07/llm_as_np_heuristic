To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants to get more money. Since the bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, Bubba can go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary to confront the clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal from the clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba decides to get money, which is a reflection of his greed and confirms that he has successfully achieved his goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk.
4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Confirms Bubba's greed and goal achievement.
