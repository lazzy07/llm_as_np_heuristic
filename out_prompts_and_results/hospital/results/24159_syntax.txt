To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to PatientRoomC**: Young will walk from the Admissions room to PatientRoomC to be assessed by Hathaway. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also evaluated and treated if needed.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young's health is also taken care of.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that both Ross and Young are healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat(Ross)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment.
3. **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Young walks to PatientRoomC.
