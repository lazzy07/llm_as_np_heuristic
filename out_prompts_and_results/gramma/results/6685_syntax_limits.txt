In this story, the Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads, where Tom, the Merchant, and the Guard are also present. The Bandit can take advantage of the situation to achieve her goal.

1. **Action: rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)** - The Bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, who is unarmed. This action allows the Bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

2. **Action: take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)** - After robbing Tom, the Bandit can now walk to the Bandit Camp and take the coins from the chest, further increasing her total amount of coins.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to the Bandit achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Taking from the Chest**: This action is essential for the Bandit to maximize her coin collection, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
