To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the market and the crossroads while avoiding conflict with the bandit and the guard. Here’s the shortest story:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks directly from the crossroads to the cottage, carrying the medicine. This action is necessary as it allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine.

The story is straightforward because Tom already has the medicine and is at the crossroads, which is the only location he needs to move to in order to achieve his goal. There are no conflicts or additional actions required since the other characters do not interfere with Tom's path to the cottage.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively outlines the single action needed for Tom to achieve his goal without any unnecessary complications.
