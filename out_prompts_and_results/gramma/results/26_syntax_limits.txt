**Story Completion:**

After robbing Tom of his coin at the crossroads, the Bandit decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that Tom is unarmed and vulnerable. 

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks back to her camp with the coin she just took from Tom. This action is necessary for her to secure her loot and be in a safe location where she can store her coins.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the camp, the Bandit places the coin into her chest. This action is crucial as it helps her achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

With these two actions, the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of walking to the camp is essential for the Bandit to secure her position and ensure she is not in danger from Tom or the guard.
- The second action of taking the coin to the chest is necessary for her to fulfill her goal of accumulating wealth without being caught.
