The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She knows that the merchant is dead and that the guard is distracted. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where she sees the guard standing over the merchant's body. 

Seeing an opportunity, the bandit attacks the guard, who is unprepared for the assault. The bandit successfully kills the guard, who is not armed with a sword, and loots the guard's sword and the coins he was carrying. With the guard out of the way, the bandit now has access to the merchant's medicine and can take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp later.

Now, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
