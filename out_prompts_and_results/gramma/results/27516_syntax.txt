To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can take the coin that Tom is carrying. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has the maximum number of coins possible.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first robbing Tom for his coin and then taking the coins from the chest at the camp.
