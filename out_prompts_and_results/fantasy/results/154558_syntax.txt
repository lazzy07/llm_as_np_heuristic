To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness. The next step is to acquire wealth, which can be done by obtaining the treasure located in the cave. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory is currently in the cave, and he needs to travel to the village where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for him to access the treasure.

2. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money that is currently with Vince's dead body in the village. This action is essential for Rory to increase his wealth.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave with the money he just picked up. This action is necessary for him to be in the location where the treasure is.

4. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

Now, Rory has both the money and the treasure, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy. He is already happy due to his marriage to Talia, and he is not hungry since he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger.
