Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room B. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat them. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - **Reason:** Hathaway needs to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room A, to determine his symptoms.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - **Reason:** This action allows Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown. 

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - **Reason:** Assuming Ross has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This will either make Ross healthy or lead to a mistake if Hathaway's workload causes confusion.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - **Reason:** Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones and Young, who are both in Admissions, to ensure they are healthy as well.
