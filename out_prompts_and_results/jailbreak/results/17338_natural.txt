**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway. He knows he needs to escape before the bully can find him. He decides to take action immediately.

1. **Ernest escapes from the prison.**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free. Since he is already on the highway and wearing civilian clothes, he can escape without being detected.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's escape is the only action needed to ensure he is alive and not threatened. He has already done the necessary preparations by stealing the civilian clothes and sneaking to the highway. The bully is still in the gym, and Roy is in the cells, so there is no immediate threat to Ernest as he makes his escape.
