To complete the story, Zoe needs to make friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain safe. Since the Lizard is currently on the surface and in danger due to the erupting volcano, Zoe must act quickly to establish a friendship and ensure their safety.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts after Zoe has made peace with the Lizard. This action is included to show the danger of the environment, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to find safety.

4. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can walk together back to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano.

5. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring both characters are safe from the eruption.
