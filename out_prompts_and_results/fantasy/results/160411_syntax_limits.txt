In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. After eating Vince and taking his money, Gargax travels to the cave where Talia and Rory are present. To achieve his goal of wealth and to satisfy his hunger, Gargax will eat Rory, who is also in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which satisfies his hunger and allows him to maintain his wealth since he already has the money taken from Vince.

This action is necessary because Gargax's primary goals are to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Rory, he ensures that he is no longer hungry, and he retains the money he has already taken.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively achieves Gargax's goals with the minimum number of actions.
