To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Jones.

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Hathaway walks to Exam Room A and assesses Jones. Given that Jones is alive and in Exam Room A, Hathaway will check for symptoms. If Jones has a fever, Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Flaze and proceed to treat him with antibiotics.
- After the assessment, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze, thus achieving the goal of making him healthy.

This sequence of actions is minimal and directly leads to Hathaway's goal of ensuring the health of the patients.
