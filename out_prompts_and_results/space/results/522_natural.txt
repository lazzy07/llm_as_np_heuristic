Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface and wanting to ensure her safety, decides to teleport back to the spaceship. This action, while making the Lizard angry, is necessary for her immediate safety. 

Once on the spaceship, Zoe can observe the planet from a safe distance and consider her next steps. Meanwhile, the Lizard, feeling threatened by Zoe's presence on the surface, decides to walk from the cave to the surface to confront her. However, upon arriving, the Lizard sees that Zoe is no longer there, and instead of fighting, the Lizard decides to make peace with Zoe, hoping to establish a friendship.

Zoe, now safe on her spaceship, sees the Lizard on the surface and decides to teleport back down, this time with the intention of making peace. The Lizard, seeing Zoe return, is open to friendship. They both express their desire to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. 

In this way, both characters achieve their goals: Zoe is safe on the spaceship and can now approach the Lizard without fear, and the Lizard, by making peace, can fulfill its desire for friendship.
