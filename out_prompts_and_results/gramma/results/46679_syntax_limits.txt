In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where she has just robbed Tom of a coin and purchased a sword. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Market to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins in the chest. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to secure her stolen coin in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

This single action is sufficient for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
