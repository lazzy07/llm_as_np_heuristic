1. **Bubba picks up Bambi**: Since Bambi is not alive, Bubba can pick up Bambi's body. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to have something to eat, which will help satisfy his hunger.

2. **Bubba decides to eat**: After picking up Bambi, Bubba can decide to eat Bambi. This action is necessary because it will satisfy Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his goal of getting money.

3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk and achieve his goal of obtaining money.
