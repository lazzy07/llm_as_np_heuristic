To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard is already at the Cave, and it will walk to the Surface. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard to the same location as Zoe, allowing for further interactions.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once the Lizard arrives on the Surface, Zoe and the Lizard can make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption, which will lead to the next action.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is the final action that results in the death of one character. Since both characters are on the Surface, they will both be affected by the eruption.

In this sequence, the characters achieve their goals of making friends while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to their demise. 

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- The Lizard walking to the Surface is essential for interaction.
- Making peace allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, which is a key goal for both characters.
- Beginning the eruption sets the stage for the volcanic activity.
- The eruption itself results in the death of both characters, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
