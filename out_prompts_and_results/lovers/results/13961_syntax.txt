To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R12). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to receive an item, and it also helps Blake to be happy since they want Alex to be happy.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the bedroom (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex again.

4. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the bedroom (R22). This is the crucial action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness, as they now have the item they want.

After these actions, the happiness states will be:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they do not have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is unhappy because they do not have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) is happy because they now have the jewelry (I3).

The actions taken are necessary to ensure that Casey ends up with the jewelry, fulfilling their desire for happiness.
