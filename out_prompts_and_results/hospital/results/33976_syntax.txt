To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomB with Young, the first action is to assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Young's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. If Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are currently there. This is important because Hathaway needs to check on their conditions to provide the necessary treatment.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Once in Admissions, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is essential for the same reason as assessing Young; Hathaway needs to know what Jones is suffering from to treat them correctly.

5. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in Admissions to determine their symptoms. This is the last step needed to ensure all patients are treated.

7. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of making them healthy.
