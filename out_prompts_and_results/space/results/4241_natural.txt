Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and health.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous. By teleporting, she can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** The Lizard chooses to walk to the cave to find a safe place away from the surface's dangers. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being safe.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs naturally in the story, emphasizing the danger of the surface. Since Zoe is now on the spaceship and the Lizard is in the cave, they are both safe from the eruption.

4. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure that they can continue their friendship. This action is motivated by her desire to make friends with other creatures.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they remain allies, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully avoids the danger of the volcano, while the Lizard finds safety in the cave. Their friendship is solidified, and they both achieve their goals of being healthy and safe.
