Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety from the erupting volcano. Since she is not fighting with the Lizard, this action does not anger the Lizard, and it allows her to regroup and think of a plan to help the Lizard.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to help the Lizard. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends now, and the urgency of the situation overrides any potential anger.

3. **Zoe walks with the Lizard to the cave.** - They both move to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps both characters achieve their goal of being healthy and safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - This reinforces their friendship and ensures that they both feel secure in their alliance, which is essential for their mutual goal of safety and health.

By the end of these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard are safe in the cave, away from the danger of the erupting volcano, and their friendship is solidified.
