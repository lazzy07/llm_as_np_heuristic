To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Talia is currently at the cave, and Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, can eat her. This will remove Talia from the story, allowing Rory to focus on his goals without the complications of multiple marriages.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's body**: After eating Talia, Gargax can take the treasure from her body. This action is crucial because it allows Gargax to become wealthy, which is a step towards Rory's goal since Rory currently has the treasure.

3. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax will then eat Vince, who is also at the village. This action is necessary to eliminate another character and ensure that Rory can focus on his own happiness and wealth without competition.

4. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money from him. This action is important because it allows Gargax to become wealthy, which indirectly helps Rory since he is now the only human left.

5. **Rory travels from the village to the cave**: Rory will then travel to the cave where Gargax is. This action is necessary for Rory to confront Gargax and negotiate or take action regarding the treasure.

6. **Rory proposes to Gargax**: Rory will propose to Gargax, seeking a partnership that could lead to mutual benefits. This action is essential for Rory to secure his happiness and wealth through collaboration.

7. **Gargax accepts Rory's proposal**: Gargax accepts the proposal, leading to both characters being happy. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve his goal of happiness.

8. **Rory and Gargax get married**: Finally, Rory and Gargax get married, solidifying their partnership. This action ensures that Rory is happy and wealthy, as he now has a dragon partner who possesses the treasure and money.

By following these actions, Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
