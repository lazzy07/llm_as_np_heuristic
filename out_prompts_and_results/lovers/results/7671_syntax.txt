To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is not happy because they want item I3 (the flowers), which is with Casey. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the bedroom where Alex is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.
   
2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I3) to Alex. This action makes Alex happy because they receive the item they want.

3. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to clear the way for future actions if needed.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves back to the dining room. This is necessary for Blake to be in a different room after giving the flowers to Alex.

Now, with Alex happy, Blake is also happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake needs to be with Alex to help them.
- **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: This directly makes Alex happy, which is Blake's goal.
- **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: While not necessary for Blake's happiness, it helps maintain organization.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake returns to the dining room, completing their actions.
