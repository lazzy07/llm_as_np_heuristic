**Story Completion:**

After admitting Young to Exam Room C, Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C. This action is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision. 

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Young**: This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify the correct disease Young has, which is essential for providing the right treatment. Without this assessment, Hathaway would not know how to proceed.
  
- **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to ensure Young's health. Since Young has Flaze, administering antibiotics will cure the disease, allowing Young to achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
