**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym and believes that Roy is safe in the laundry room with the stolen cigarettes. To ensure their safety and to eliminate the threat, Ernest uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to confront the bully. He sneaks into the gym through the hallway, where he locks the door behind him to prevent the bully from escaping. With the knife in hand, he confronts the bully and kills him, ensuring that both he and Roy are no longer threatened.
