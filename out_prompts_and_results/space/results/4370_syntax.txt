1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further their friendship and ensure they are in the same location to interact positively.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will again attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and solidifies their bond.

4. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will then walk back to the surface. This action is taken to ensure they are both in a safe location together.

5. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe will initiate the eruption of the volcano. This action is taken to create a sense of urgency and danger, prompting both characters to work together for safety.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to create a dramatic conclusion where both characters must escape together, solidifying their friendship and ensuring their safety.
