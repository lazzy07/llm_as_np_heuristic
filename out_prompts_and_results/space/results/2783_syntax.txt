To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)** - The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard to the same location as Zoe, allowing them to interact directly.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe and the Lizard make peace on the surface. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts on the surface. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where a character dies due to the eruption.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)** - The Lizard dies as a result of the eruption. This action is included to ensure that one character dies, which is part of the desired outcome.

The final sequence of actions leads to the following outcomes:
- The Lizard and Zoe become friends before the eruption.
- The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- The Lizard needs to be on the surface to interact with Zoe, hence the first action of walking to the surface.
- Making peace is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of friendship.
- The eruption of the volcano is a critical event that leads to the death of the Lizard.
- The final action confirms the death of the Lizard due to the eruption.
