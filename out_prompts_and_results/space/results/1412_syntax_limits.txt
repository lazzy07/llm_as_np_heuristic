Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard instead of continuing to fight. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing that they both want to be healthy and safe. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's sincerity, agrees to make peace. 

However, just as they are about to solidify their friendship, the volcano erupts, sending lava and ash into the air. Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, manage to escape the immediate danger, but the eruption causes chaos on the surface. In the end, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and tragically dies, while Zoe narrowly escapes back to her spaceship.

The actions taken are:
1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, aligning with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends and be safe.
2. **erupt(Surface)**: This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, leading to the Lizard's demise, which is a key part of the story's conclusion.
