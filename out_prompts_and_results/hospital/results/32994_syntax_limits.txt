In this story, we will ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats Young, who is currently showing symptoms of SymptomA. We will also admit and assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, to ensure they are healthy as well.

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomA to confirm the symptoms. Since Young is showing SymptomA, Hathaway can determine the appropriate treatment.
   
2. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with the correct treatment for SymptomA, which is antibiotics (assuming SymptomA corresponds to Flaze). This will make Young healthy.

3. **Admit and Assess Jones**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B and assesses him to check for any symptoms. This will ensure that Jones is also healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will achieve their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
