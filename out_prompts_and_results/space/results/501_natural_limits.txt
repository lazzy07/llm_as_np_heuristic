Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She knows that the Lizard is at risk on the surface and that they need to establish a relationship to survive together. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and assess the situation on the surface. By walking, she avoids angering the Lizard, which is crucial for building a friendship.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Upon reaching the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. This action is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and friendship. By making peace, they can work together to escape the danger of the erupting volcano.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - As Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can face the eruption together. However, since the volcano erupts while they are on the surface, it results in the Lizard dying. This action concludes the story with the volcano erupting and highlights the tragic outcome of their friendship.

In summary, the actions taken are aimed at ensuring Zoe's safety, establishing a friendship with the Lizard, and ultimately leading to the eruption of the volcano, which results in the Lizard's death.
