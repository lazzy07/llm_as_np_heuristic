**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently in Patient Room A, where Ross and Young are present. Since Dr. Hathaway is overwhelmed, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. However, Ross is in the correct room for assessment.

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Despite the risk of misdiagnosis due to the high workload, it is essential for Ross's treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms (which could be either Flaze or Jarkis), this action is crucial for Ross to become healthy. If treated correctly, Ross will recover.

3. **Dr. Hathaway reduces workload by treating Ross.**  
   - This action is implicit in the treatment step, as it allows Dr. Hathaway to manage their workload better, potentially leading to better care for other patients.

4. **Ross walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - After treatment, Ross can leave the exam room, indicating that he is healthy and ready to go.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- The treatment is the decisive action that determines whether Ross will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
- Reducing the workload is a necessary consequence of the treatment, allowing Dr. Hathaway to focus on other patients.
