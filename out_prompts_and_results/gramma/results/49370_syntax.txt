To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to ensure that the Merchant does not have any items that could be used against her, and it also allows the Bandit to gain an item that could be useful later.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, which is part of her goal.

3. **Take the Coins from the Chest**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action is essential as it directly fulfills her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit takes the medicine from the Merchant, ensuring she has an advantage and removing a potential threat.
2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: The Bandit moves to her preferred location to secure her loot.
