**Story Completion:**

1. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Kitchen)**  
   - Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier from the laundry. This action is crucial as it allows him to disguise himself and prepares him for an escape.

2. **Action: go(Roy, Hall)**  
   - Roy moves from the kitchen to the hallway. This is necessary for him to access the highway where he can escape.

   - Roy successfully escapes from the prison by using the disguise. This is the ultimate goal he wanted to achieve, ensuring his survival and freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising is essential because without the civilian clothes, Roy would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would not be able to escape. 
- Moving to the hallway is a necessary step to reach the highway, as it connects the kitchen to the outside world.
- Finally, escaping is the culmination of Roy's efforts to ensure he is alive and free, fulfilling his goal.
