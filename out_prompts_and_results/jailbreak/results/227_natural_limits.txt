As the day progressed, Roy realized he needed to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decided to sneak back through the vent to the kitchen, where he knew the knife was located. 

Once in the kitchen, Roy quietly grabbed the knife, knowing it would be essential for their survival against the bully. He then made his way back to the hallway, where he could hear the bully's threats echoing from the cell block.
