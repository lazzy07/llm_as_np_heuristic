To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess and admit Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment.

5. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

6. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Young also has a chance to become healthy.
