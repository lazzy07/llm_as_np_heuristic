To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, while Bambi is alive in the forest. Bubba's goal is to have money, and Bambi's goal is to stay alive. 

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and has a loaded rifle. Shooting Bambi will allow him to eat, which satisfies his hunger and also leads to Bambi's death.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action directly results in Bambi being dead, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the dead animal, which satisfies his hunger.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can now take any money that Bambi might have had, ensuring that he has money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi:** This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his hunger and eliminate Bambi.
- **Bubba shoots Bambi:** This action results in Bambi's death, which is one of the required outcomes.
- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger after killing Bambi.
- **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi:** This action ensures that Bubba has money, fulfilling his goal.

The final story ends with Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.
