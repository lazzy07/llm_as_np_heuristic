**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Roy, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decided to take action. He knew that Ernest was still in the cells and that they needed to escape the bully's wrath. 

Roy took a deep breath and made a bold decision. He crawled through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully was still locked inside. Once he reached the gym, he pulled out the knife he had stolen from the kitchen. With the element of surprise on his side, he confronted the bully. 

In a swift motion, Roy used the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest would no longer be threatened. With the bully out of the way, Roy felt a sense of relief wash over him. He quickly made his way back to the hallway, where he could now safely retrieve the civilian clothes from the laundry room. 

With the civilian clothes in hand, Roy put them on to disguise himself. He then crawled through the vents again, this time heading towards the highway. Once outside, he successfully escaped from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
