Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A, where Young is experiencing a fever. To ensure Young's health, Hathaway needs to treat Young for Flaze, the disease associated with fever. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

To reduce the workload and ensure Young receives the correct treatment, Hathaway will first assess Young again to confirm the symptoms. After confirming the fever, Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Young healthy.

Next, Hathaway will admit Ross to Patient Room B, where he is currently in Admissions. This will allow Hathaway to manage Ross's care without increasing the workload further, as Hathaway will not be treating Ross yet.

2. Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A with antibiotics for Flaze.
