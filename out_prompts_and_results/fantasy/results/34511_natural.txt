To achieve Vince's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince has, which is the only wealth present in the cave. This action will also lead to Vince's death, which allows Gargax to take the money from Vince's body.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This action fulfills Gargax's desire to be wealthy and not hungry.

3. **Gargax becomes hungry**: Gargax's hunger is now at 0 after eating Vince, but since Gargax does not care about being happy, this action is not necessary for Gargax's goals. However, it is implied that Gargax will not need to take further actions to satisfy hunger.

4. **Gargax's wealth increases**: After taking the money from Vince, Gargax's wealth increases, fulfilling Gargax's goal of being wealthy.

5. **Vince's happiness is 0**: Since Vince is dead, he cannot achieve happiness anymore.

In this scenario, Vince does not achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, as he is eaten by Gargax. However, Gargax achieves its goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
