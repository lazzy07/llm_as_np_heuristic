To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen from the clerk. He is hungry and has 1 money, while the clerk has none. Bambi is in the forest and is alive.

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba wants to find Bambi, who is alive, and he may want to eat her.)
3. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot Bambi, fulfilling his goal of either having the money or killing Bambi.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Now that Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her.)

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of either having the money or killing Bambi, as he ends up killing Bambi.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger before taking further actions.

- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi.
