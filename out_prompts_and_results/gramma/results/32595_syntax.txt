To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is already at the Market, so she will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is at the Crossroads. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can take one of the coins that Tom is carrying.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp and take the coins from the chest, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Market and needs to move to the Crossroads to interact with Tom.
- Robbing Tom is a strategic move since he is unarmed and the Bandit can take a coin from him.
- Finally, the Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Camp, maximizing her coin count.
