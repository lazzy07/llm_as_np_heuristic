To achieve Talia's happiness or wealth, we can focus on the actions that will directly benefit her. Since Talia is already married to both Vince and Rory, we can leverage their wealth to make her happy or wealthy. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. Gargax, who is hungry and wants to be wealthy, decides to eat Rory, who is at the cave with the treasure. This action eliminates Rory, allowing Gargax to take the treasure.
2. Gargax then travels to the village, where Talia and Vince are. Gargax can take the money from Vince, which will make Talia wealthy since she is married to Vince.

Now, Talia will be wealthy because she is married to Vince, who has the money. 

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because it allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, which is a valuable item. By removing Rory from the story, it also simplifies the situation for Talia, as she no longer has to compete with Rory for wealth.
2. **Gargax travels to the village and takes the money from Vince**: This action allows Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth while simultaneously making Talia wealthy through her marriage to Vince. 

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json

  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Rory",
    "Gargax travels to the village and takes the money from Vince"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia becomes wealthy, fulfilling her goal.
