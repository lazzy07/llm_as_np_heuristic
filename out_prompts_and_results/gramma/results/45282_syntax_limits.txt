In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp with the Medicine, and the Bandit is at the Crossroads. The Bandit has a sword and is a criminal, which poses a threat to the Merchant. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to be in the same location as the Bandit, who is carrying coins. 

At the Crossroads, the Merchant can then attempt to negotiate or interact with the Bandit to acquire coins without resorting to criminal actions. However, since the goal is to keep the story short and the Merchant's goal is to maximize coins without becoming a criminal, the action of walking to the Crossroads is sufficient to set up the potential for future interactions.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant walking to the Crossroads is the only action needed to position herself to potentially acquire coins from the Bandit. This action does not involve any criminal activity, thus keeping the Merchant within her goal of not becoming a criminal.
