To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to identify his symptoms. This is essential for determining the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but for the sake of this story, we will assume Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's disease.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the identified symptoms. This action is vital for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

With these two actions, Ross will successfully become healthy.
