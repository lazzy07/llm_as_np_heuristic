To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex, which is what Alex wants.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

3. **Blake moves to the bathroom.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but sets up Blake to potentially find the chocolates later.

4. **Casey moves to the bathroom.**  
   - This action is also not necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Casey to potentially interact with Blake regarding the chocolates.

5. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the chocolates, which is what Blake wants.

6. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the bathroom.**  
   - This action allows Casey to receive the chocolates, making Blake happy.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is already happy with the jewelry.
