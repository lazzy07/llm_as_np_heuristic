**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway is currently in Patient Room A, where Young is experiencing a rash. Since Dr. Hathaway knows that a rash indicates Jarkis, they can treat Young accordingly. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** This action is necessary because Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (rash), and treating them with steroids will make Young healthy, which is Dr. Hathaway's goal.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced by one, and Young becomes healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are currently in the admissions room.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** Assuming Jones has a fever (the only symptom left), this action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary to admit Ross to an exam room.

7. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** Assuming Ross also has a fever, this action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients (Young, Jones, and Ross) are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Young for Jarkis is the first step to ensure at least one patient is healthy.
- Walking to Admissions allows Dr. Hathaway to manage the other patients.
- Admitting and assessing Jones and Ross ensures they receive the necessary treatment based on their symptoms.
- Treating both Jones and Ross for Flaze ensures that all patients are healthy.
