To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit then walks to the market, where the merchant and the guard are located. This is crucial as the bandit needs to interact with the merchant to acquire coins.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The bandit robs the merchant, taking the coins that Tom is carrying. This action is possible because the bandit is armed and the merchant is not carrying a sword.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to Crossroads and Market**: These actions are necessary for the bandit to reach the locations where she can interact with the merchant and potentially rob her.
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as the merchant is not armed.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin collection, fulfilling her goal.
