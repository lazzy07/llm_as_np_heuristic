In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and a character dies, we can have Zoe take an action that leads to her demise.

1. **Erupt the volcano**: The volcano on the surface is already in a dangerous state, and we can choose to have it erupt, which will lead to Zoe's death.

This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of having a character die and to conclude the story with a dramatic event.

Here’s the complete story:

Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the volcano. Despite her desire to make friends with the Lizard, she knows that the eruption is unavoidable. As the ground shakes beneath her feet, she realizes that she must act quickly. In a moment of desperation, she decides to trigger the eruption, hoping to escape to the ship before it’s too late. However, the eruption is too powerful, and she is caught in the blast, leading to her demise.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death.
