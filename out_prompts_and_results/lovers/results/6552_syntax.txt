To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves from the bedroom (R12) to the living room (R21). This action is included to ensure that Blake is present to witness Alex's happiness and to maintain the social dynamic.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake's movement is included to keep the story dynamic and ensure all characters are involved.
