In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (flowers) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) wants the item I3 (jewelry) to be happy, and Blake (C2) wants the item I2 (chocolates) to be happy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey for the flowers (I1) that they want. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be unhappy.
- Blake will remain unhappy as they still do not have the chocolates (I2).

This single trade action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows Alex to achieve their goal with the minimum number of actions.
