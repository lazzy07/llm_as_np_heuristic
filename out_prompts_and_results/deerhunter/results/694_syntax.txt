To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he is hungry. He also believes that the bank clerk has money. The only way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to confront the bank clerk and take the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the bank after committing the theft.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Now that Bubba has the money, he can focus on his hunger. This action indicates that Bubba is considering his next steps, possibly to buy food.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba decides to hunt and eat Bambi, which fulfills his hunger. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking care of his needs after achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to confront the clerk to get the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This is the action where Bubba successfully takes the money from the clerk.
