In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, but their relationship is currently strained. To achieve her goal of safety and friendship, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**  
- This action is taken because Zoe wants to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy. By making peace, they can work together to navigate the dangers of the erupting volcano.

After making peace, the Lizard realizes that Zoe is not a threat and that they can collaborate to ensure their safety. However, the volcano erupts shortly after, leading to a dangerous situation.

**Action: erupt(Surface)**  
- This action is included because the volcano has begun to erupt, and it is a critical event that affects the safety of both characters. Since Zoe is in the cave, she is safe, but the Lizard, being on the surface, is in danger.

In the end, Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, but the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also achieving the goal of friendship.
