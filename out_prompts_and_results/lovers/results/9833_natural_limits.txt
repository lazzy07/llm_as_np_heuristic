In the dining room, Alex sees the chocolates on the table. Knowing that Casey has the flowers, Alex decides to take action to achieve their goal of happiness. 

**Action:**
- Alex picks up the chocolates in the dining room.

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, but since Casey has them, Alex cannot directly obtain them. However, by picking up the chocolates, Alex can potentially trade them with Casey later, which could lead to Alex getting the flowers. This action is the only one needed to set up a future trade, as it allows Alex to have an item of value that can be exchanged.
