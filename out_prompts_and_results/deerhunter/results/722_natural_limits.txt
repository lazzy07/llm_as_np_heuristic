Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, decides to take action. He knows that the clerk at the bank has money, and he believes that with the rifle loaded, he can intimidate the clerk into giving it to him. 

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action allows Bubba to eliminate the threat and take the clerk's money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

After these actions, Bubba successfully takes the clerk's money and satisfies his hunger by planning to eat later.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger indirectly by eliminating the clerk as a threat.
