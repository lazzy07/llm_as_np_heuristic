To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi is a potential target for Bubba's hunger.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - Bubba has a loaded rifle and is hungry. Shooting Bambi allows Bubba to obtain food, which is essential for survival. This action also aligns with Bubba's goal of getting money indirectly, as he may sell or trade the meat later.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a priority for him.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank, where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to interact with the clerk and potentially obtain money.

5. **Bubba steals the clerk's money.**  
   - With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can steal the clerk's money. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
