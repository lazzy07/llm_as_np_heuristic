**Story Completion:**

Ernest, after finishing his chores in the laundry room, decides to sneak into the kitchen to retrieve the knife. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he needs to defend himself and Roy. 

1. **Action: Ernest moves to the kitchen.**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to obtain the knife, which he needs to protect himself and Roy from the bully.

2. **Action: Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.**  
   - By acquiring the knife, Ernest is now armed and can defend himself against the bully's threats.

3. **Action: Ernest moves to the gym.**  
   - Ernest needs to confront the bully in the gym, where the bully is currently located.

4. **Action: Ernest kills the bully with the knife.**  
   - This action ensures that the bully can no longer threaten either Ernest or Roy, allowing them both to feel safe.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on finding a way to escape with Roy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is focused on achieving Ernest's goal of staying alive and not being threatened. By moving to the kitchen, he secures a weapon (the knife) to defend himself. Moving to the gym allows him to confront the bully directly, and ultimately killing the bully removes the immediate threat to both him and Roy.
