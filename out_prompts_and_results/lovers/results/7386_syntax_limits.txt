To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, we need to ensure that Casey receives the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Alex is already happy with the chocolates (I1), the focus will be on helping Casey.

Here's the completed story:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they want, which will make them happy. Since Alex is already happy, this action directly contributes to Alex's goal of ensuring Casey's happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is happy with the chocolates (I1).
- Casey (C3) is now happy with the jewelry (I3).
- Blake (C2) is happy with the chocolates (I2) they received from the trade.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of ensuring Casey's happiness.
