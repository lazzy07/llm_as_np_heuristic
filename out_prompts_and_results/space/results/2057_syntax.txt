To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion. The actions will be carefully chosen to achieve the desired ending.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the planet's surface where she can interact with the Lizard and the volcano is located.
   
2. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard in the cave, facilitating their interaction and potential friendship.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is crucial as it establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual desire for companionship.

4. **The volcano erupts**: This action is the climax of the story, leading to the destruction of the surface and resulting in a character's death.

5. **Zoe dies**: As a result of the eruption, Zoe is killed, which adds a tragic element to the story while still allowing for the friendship established with the Lizard.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired ending where the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the Lizard and Zoe become friends before the tragic conclusion.
