Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano, which has already begun to rumble ominously. 

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano starts to erupt, creating a sense of urgency for both Zoe and the Lizard. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger that will lead to the climax of the story.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, realizing the threat of the volcano, decide to put aside their differences and work together. This action solidifies their friendship, which is essential for the story's resolution.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing chaos on the surface. This action results in the death of Zoe, as she is unable to escape in time. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also highlighting the consequences of the dangerous environment they are in.

In summary, the actions taken lead to the eruption of the volcano, the death of Zoe, and the establishment of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, as they unite against a common threat.
