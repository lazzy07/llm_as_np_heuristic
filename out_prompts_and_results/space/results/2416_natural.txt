Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve a resolution, Zoe needs to establish a friendship with the Lizard while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to transition from being enemies to friends. Since they are both in the cave and not fighting, they can communicate and find common ground, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have made peace. The eruption signifies the danger of the planet's surface and serves as a dramatic climax to the story. Since the surface is already uninhabitable, the eruption does not directly affect Zoe and the Lizard, but it emphasizes the peril of their previous location.

The story concludes with Zoe and the Lizard as friends, having successfully navigated their initial enmity, while the volcano erupts, showcasing the volatile nature of the planet they are on.
