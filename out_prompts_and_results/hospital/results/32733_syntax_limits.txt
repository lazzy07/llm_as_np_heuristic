In this story, we need to ensure that Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Ross**: This action is essential to identify Ross's condition. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but it is still necessary to attempt to assess Ross to provide him with the correct treatment.
  
- **Treating Ross**: This action directly addresses Ross's health. By treating him with the correct medication based on the assessment, Hathaway can ensure that Ross becomes healthy, which is his ultimate goal.
