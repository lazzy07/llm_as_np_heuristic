**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take a risk. He quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, knowing that he needs to secure a way to protect himself and Roy. Once in the hallway, he crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where the bully is currently occupied. 

Once inside the gym, Ernest finds the bully and, with the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen, he confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he takes revenge and kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Roy are no longer threatened. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now enjoy the pack of cigarettes he stole earlier without fear.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Move to the hallway:** Ernest needs to get to a position where he can access the gym without being threatened by the bully. The hallway serves as a transition point.
   
2. **Crawl through the vents to the gym:** This action allows Ernest to bypass any potential confrontation with the bully in the laundry room and directly confront him in the gym.

3. **Kill the bully with the knife:** This is the decisive action that eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to live without fear.
