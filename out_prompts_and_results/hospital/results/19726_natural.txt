**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A with Jones, realizes that her workload is high and she needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to check for symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to her high workload. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. Since Jones does not actually have Flaze, he dies from the incorrect treatment.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess the other patients, Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C, increasing her workload again.

5. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B, further increasing her workload.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes he has Flaze.

7. **Treat Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, leading to his death as well.

8. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. She mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to her workload.

9. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, resulting in his death as well.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although well-intentioned, lead to the deaths of all patients due to her misdiagnosis caused by her high workload. However, she has treated all patients, which aligns with her goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, albeit with tragic results.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing and treating Jones was necessary to determine his condition and attempt to make him healthy.
- Walking to Admissions was required to check on the other patients.
- Admitting Ross and Young was necessary to manage their care.
- Assessing and treating Ross and Young followed the same logic as with Jones, aiming to help them despite the misdiagnosis.
