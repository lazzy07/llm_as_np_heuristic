Bubba is in the forest, having just shot Bambi. He is hungry and wants to have money. Since he has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he decides to go to the bank to get money from the clerk.

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to reach the bank to get the money he desires.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal the money from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can now eat Bambi, which is dead.)

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money and has also satisfied his hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Stealing the money** is the direct action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money, as he has the means (the loaded rifle) to do so.
- **Deciding to eat** is a final action that satisfies Bubba's hunger after having shot Bambi.
