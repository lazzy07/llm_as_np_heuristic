In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that Blake has, as Blake is currently unhappy because they do not have the item they want. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey achieving their goal:

1. **Trade**: Casey can trade the item they have (I2, which is chocolates) with Blake for the item Blake has (I3, which is jewelry) in the living room (R21).

This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy. Since Blake also wants to be happy and is currently unhappy, they will agree to the trade, as they will receive chocolates, which they may want.

After this trade, the situation will be:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness while also considering Blake's happiness, fulfilling the story's requirements.
