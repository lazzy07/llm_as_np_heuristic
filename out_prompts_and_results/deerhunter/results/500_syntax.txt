To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle loaded with ammunition, and he is hungry. He also has a desire for money, which he can obtain by either stealing from the bank clerk or by killing Bambi and eating her.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba will shoot Bambi, which will result in Bambi being dead. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger and also eliminates a potential threat (Bambi) in the future.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is one of his immediate needs.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to pursue his goal of obtaining money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle. This action fulfills Bubba's greed and allows him to obtain the money he desires.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba eliminates Bambi, which satisfies his hunger and removes a living target.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, fulfilling his hunger.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba travels to the bank to pursue his goal of obtaining money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the bank clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead.
