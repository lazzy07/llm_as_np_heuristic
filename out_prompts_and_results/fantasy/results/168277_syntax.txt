To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the same location as Gargax, and since Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, eating Rory will help fulfill that need. This action will also eliminate one of the humans, which may simplify the situation for Gargax.

2. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax will travel to the Cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for Gargax to obtain the treasure, which will contribute to their wealth.

3. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax will pick up the treasure in the Cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

4. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax will become hungry again after picking up the treasure, but this is not a concern since Gargax has already achieved their goal of wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Gargax eats Rory to satisfy hunger and eliminate a competitor.
- Gargax travels to the Cave to access the treasure.
- Gargax picks up the treasure, achieving wealth.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, as they have the treasure and have eaten.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)",

  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Gargax's goals are met efficiently, leading to the desired outcome.
