Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially help the Lizard. She knows that the Lizard is at risk and that they need to communicate to avoid conflict. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard directly and assess the situation. She needs to be on the surface to understand the Lizard's perspective and the imminent danger.

2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard.** - This action allows Zoe to initiate a conversation with the Lizard, which is crucial for establishing a relationship and potentially making peace.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can become friends. This action is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and friendship.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This action ensures both characters are safe from the eruption, allowing them to escape the danger together.

In this story, the actions taken lead to the eruption of the volcano, but because Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, they are able to escape together, ensuring their survival and the beginning of a friendship.
