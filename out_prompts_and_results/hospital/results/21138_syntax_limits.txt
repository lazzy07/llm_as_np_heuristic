**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. If Jones indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Rash, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room C. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomC**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. If Young indeed has Jarkis, he will also become healthy.
