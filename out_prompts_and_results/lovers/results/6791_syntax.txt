To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Hereâ€™s a concise story that accomplishes this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R22) to be closer to Alex, who is in the same room and has the jewelry.
   
2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic lie to mislead Alex into thinking that Casey is not interested in the jewelry, which allows for a smoother exchange later.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to find Blake, who has the chocolates (I2) and is unaware of Casey's true desire for the jewelry.

4. **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R21). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.

5. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to see what is happening, but they are not involved in the exchange of items.

At the end of these actions, Casey has the jewelry they wanted, making them happy. Alex is also happy because they helped Casey achieve their goal, and Blake remains neutral as they did not interfere with the exchange.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to communicate and receive the item.
- **tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)**: This action is a strategic move to mislead Alex, ensuring they do not realize Casey's true desire for the jewelry.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to find Blake, creating an opportunity for the exchange without interference.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: This is the crucial action where Casey receives the jewelry, fulfilling their goal.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake's movement is to observe but does not affect the outcome.
