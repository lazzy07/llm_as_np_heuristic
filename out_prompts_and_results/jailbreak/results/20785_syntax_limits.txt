**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Roy knows he has a chance to confront the bully without any immediate threats. He takes a deep breath, grips the knife tightly, and decides to take revenge on the bully. 

In the locked gym, Roy approaches the bully, who is unaware of the danger he is in. With a swift motion, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now safely escape the prison. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. 

As the day ends, Roy makes his way to the hallway, then crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once there, he confidently walks away, free at last.
