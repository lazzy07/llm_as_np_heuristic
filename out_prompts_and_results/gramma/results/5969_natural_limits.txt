**Story Completion:**

The bandit, seeing the guard at the market, decides to take action. She approaches the guard and reports her location, claiming that she has seen a criminal nearby. The guard, believing the bandit, leaves the market to investigate the claim, leaving Tom and the merchant alone.

With the guard gone, Tom seizes the opportunity. He approaches the merchant and offers her the hero's coin in exchange for the medicine. The merchant, eager to make a sale without becoming a criminal, agrees and hands over the medicine to Tom.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **The bandit reports her location to the guard.** This action is necessary because it distracts the guard, allowing Tom and the merchant to interact without the threat of the guard intervening.
   
2. **Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using the hero's coin.** This action fulfills the merchant's goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as she successfully sells the medicine to Tom.
