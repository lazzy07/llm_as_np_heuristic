In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Here's the completion of the story:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake (C2) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) in the living room (R21). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the jewelry they want, which will make Alex happy. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) now has the jewelry (I1) and is happy.
- Blake (C2) has the flowers (I3) and is also happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
- Casey (C3) is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (chocolates, I2).
