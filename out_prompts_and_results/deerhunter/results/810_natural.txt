To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given that Bubba is currently at the bank and wants to get money, he will take actions that lead him to achieve this goal. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba becomes greedy.** (This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of wanting to have money.)
2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully stolen the money from the clerk, achieving his goal. Bambi remains alive, but since the requirement is only for Bubba to have the money or for Bambi to be dead, we can conclude the story here.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba becomes greedy:** This action is necessary to motivate Bubba to take further actions towards acquiring money.
- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk:** This action is a logical step for Bubba to take since he is at the bank and has a loaded rifle, which gives him the power to intimidate the clerk.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action directly results in Bubba achieving his goal of having money.
