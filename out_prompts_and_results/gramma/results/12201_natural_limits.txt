Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant, who has the medicine he desires. The bandit, armed and at the market, poses a potential threat, but Tom is focused on his goal. 

To achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, Tom decides to take action. He reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence, allowing the guard to take action against the bandit, thus ensuring Tom's safety as he retrieves the medicine.

After reporting, Tom walks back to the market, where the merchant is still located. He then takes the medicine from the merchant, fulfilling his goal of carrying it. 

Finally, Tom walks from the market back to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
