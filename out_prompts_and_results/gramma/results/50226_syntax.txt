To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market where Tom is located. This is necessary because the bandit needs to confront Tom to achieve her goal of obtaining coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit robs Tom of the coin he is carrying. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit returns to the crossroads. This is necessary to position herself for the next action.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins. This is the final step to ensure her goal is met.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The bandit first moves to the market to confront Tom, who has a coin.
- She then robs Tom, successfully increasing her coin count.
- After robbing Tom, she returns to the crossroads to prepare for her next move.
- Finally, she walks to the bandit camp to secure her coins.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of carrying coins.
