To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the actions that can lead to her happiness or wealth. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave with Rory, Vince, and Gargax. Vince has the money, and the treasure is also at the cave. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the equation, allowing Talia to take the money and treasure without any competition. 

2. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body**: After Vince is eaten, Talia can take the money that Vince had. This action directly contributes to Talia's wealth.

3. **Talia takes the treasure**: Talia can then take the treasure that is at the cave. This action increases her wealth further.

4. **Talia becomes happy**: With the money and treasure, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy, which in turn makes her happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action eliminates a competitor for the money and treasure, allowing Talia to access them.
- **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body**: This action directly increases Talia's wealth.
- **Talia takes the treasure**: This action further increases Talia's wealth.
- **Talia becomes happy**: Achieving wealth leads to Talia's happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

    "Gargax eats Vince",

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia becomes wealthy and, consequently, happy, fulfilling her goals effectively.
