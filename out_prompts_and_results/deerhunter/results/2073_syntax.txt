To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money rather than earning it through legitimate means.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba, who is hungry, will decide to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after the stressful events of stealing.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank to find Bambi, the deer, who he can eat. This action is necessary because Bubba needs food to satisfy his hunger.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba will shoot Bambi, killing her. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain food, as he is hungry and needs to eat.

6. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger after the earlier events.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money and satisfying his hunger.
