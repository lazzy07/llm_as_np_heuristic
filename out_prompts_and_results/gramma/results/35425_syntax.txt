To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying coins. This action allows the Bandit to take the coins from Tom, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring her goal of having coins in the chest is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is necessary for the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to commit a more violent crime, as Tom is unarmed and thus vulnerable.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is essential for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can secure her stolen coins.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins stored safely, fulfilling her objective.
