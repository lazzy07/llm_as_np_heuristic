In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is currently with Casey, C2), and Blake has item I1. To achieve their goal, Blake can give item I1 to Casey, which will allow Casey to be happy since they want item I2 (which is currently unknown to Blake). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I1) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to potentially become happy, depending on whether they want the chocolates or not. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Blake is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I3).
- Casey is now happy if they wanted the chocolates (I1) or if they can trade it for the item they want (I2).
- Alex remains unhappy as they still do not have I3.

However, since the goal is for Blake to achieve happiness, and they have successfully given an item to help Casey, Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy is indirectly supported by helping Casey.
