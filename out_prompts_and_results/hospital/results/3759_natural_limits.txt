Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in Admissions. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in Admissions (Jones, Ross, and Young) to assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not know the exact disease yet.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - Similar to the previous action, this allows Dr. Hathaway to check Young's symptoms. Again, since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not know the exact disease yet.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to assign Young to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to treat Young later.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has assessed both Ross and Young, and has admitted Young to an exam room. Dr. Hathaway can now treat Young for the unknown symptoms, ensuring that all patients are on the path to health.
