To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action takes him directly to his desired location, fulfilling his goal of being at the Cottage.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine in his possession from the previous events. There are no obstacles in his way, and he does not need to interact with any other characters to achieve his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it directly moves Tom from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be. Since he already has the medicine, this action completes his objective.
