Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and friendship.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, where they can continue to build their friendship and ensure their health and safety.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave.** Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and commitment to working together for their mutual safety.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave.** This action allows them to avoid the dangers of the surface, including the potential eruption of the volcano. By staying in the cave, they can ensure they remain healthy and safe.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.
