Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has a loaded rifle, he aims and shoots Bambi. This action fulfills his hunger by providing food, and he can also take the opportunity to collect Bambi's body for a meal. However, since Bubba's primary goal is to have money, he then decides to go back to the bank to confront the clerk.

In this case, Bubba's actions are necessary to achieve his goal of having money. By shooting Bambi, he not only satisfies his hunger but also positions himself to potentially steal money from the clerk later, as he is now armed and can intimidate the clerk.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary action:

1. Bubba shoots Bambi. (This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger and potentially gain food.)

Now, Bubba can go back to the bank to confront the clerk, but since the goal is to achieve money, we can stop here as the story is already complete with the action taken.
