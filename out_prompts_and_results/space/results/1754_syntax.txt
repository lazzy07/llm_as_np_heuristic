To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and head to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, sensing Zoe's presence, walks back to the cave. This action is included to create a scenario where both characters are in the same location, allowing for a potential conflict or resolution.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is crucial as it sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to one character's demise.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, now both on the surface, decide to make peace with each other. This action is vital for them to transition from being neutral or adversarial to friends, which aligns with their goals of wanting to make friends.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in a catastrophic event. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying, as the eruption will lead to the demise of one of the characters.

6. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard dies as a result of the eruption. This action is included to ensure that the story ends with a character dying, fulfilling the requirement of the story's conclusion.

In summary, the actions taken lead to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and the friendship formed between Zoe and the Lizard just before the eruption. The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that both characters achieve their goals while also fulfilling the story's requirements.
