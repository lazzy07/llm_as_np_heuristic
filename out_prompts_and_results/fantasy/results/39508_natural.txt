To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to leave the cave where he has the money and travel to the village where Talia and Rory are. 

2. **Vince gives the money to Rory.**  
   - This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he will now possess the money that Vince had. 

3. **Rory and Talia become happy.**  
   - Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, they are now married, and Rory's happiness increases as a result of their marriage.

4. **Rory's hunger remains at 0.**  
   - Rory does not need to take any action regarding hunger since he is not hungry.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goals of being happy (due to his marriage to Talia) and wealthy (by receiving the money from Vince). 

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary actions:

1. Vince travels from the cave to the village.
2. Vince gives the money to Rory.
3. Rory and Talia become happy.
