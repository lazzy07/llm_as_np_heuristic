**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A first. She walks into the room and assesses Young, discovering that Young has a fever, which indicates Flaze. 

Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 2 after assessing Young, she treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young of Flaze. Young is now healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Ross to an exam room. She admits Ross to Patient Room B, where Jones is currently located. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room B, discovering that Jones has a rash, indicating Jarkis. With her workload now at 3, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Flaze due to the high workload. She treats Jones with antibiotics, which unfortunately does not cure him, and he dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C, discovering that Ross has a rash, indicating Jarkis. She treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him.
