To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to proceed.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Similarly, Hathaway must assess Young to identify their symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

3. **Walk to PatientRoomC**: After assessing both patients, Hathaway needs to move to PatientRoomC to treat Jones.

4. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment.

5. **Walk back to PatientRoomB**: After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to return to PatientRoomB to treat Young.

6. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both patients are treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones and Young**: These actions are crucial to identify the diseases affecting the patients, which is necessary for effective treatment.
- **Walking between rooms**: This is required for Hathaway to move to the locations where the patients are assigned for treatment.
- **Treating with the correct medication**: This is the final step to ensure that both patients recover from their respective diseases.
