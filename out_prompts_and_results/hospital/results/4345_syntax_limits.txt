**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, realizing their workload is high, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in the admissions room. Since Ross is showing symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway correctly identifies the disease.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which makes Ross healthy.
