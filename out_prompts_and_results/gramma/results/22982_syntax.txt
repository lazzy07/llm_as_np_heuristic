To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is already at the Camp, and she will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is at the Crossroads.

2. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from Tom using one of the coins she has. This action allows her to acquire an item of value while also gaining a coin from Tom, which is beneficial for her goal.
