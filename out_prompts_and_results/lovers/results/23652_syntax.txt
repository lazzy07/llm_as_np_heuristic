To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1 - flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially trade or receive the item they want.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This action is important because it communicates Alex's desire to Casey, who may be able to help fulfill that desire.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the key action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the previous room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Allows Alex to be in the same room as Casey and Blake to facilitate communication.
- **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Communicates Alex's desire for flowers to Casey, which is essential for Casey to understand what Alex wants.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the critical action that directly results in Alex obtaining the flowers, making them happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: While not necessary for achieving happiness, it provides a sense of closure to the scene.
