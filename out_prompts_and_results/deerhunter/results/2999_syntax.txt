To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just shot Bambi, and is hungry. He has also stolen a rifle from the bank clerk and has some money. 

Since Bubba is hungry, he will want to eat. However, he cannot eat Bambi because she is already dead, and he has no other food source. Therefore, he will need to go back to the bank to get more money, as he is already greedy and wants to increase his wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to find more money. This is necessary because he is greedy and wants to increase his wealth.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the rifle from the bank clerk again. This action is included to ensure he has a weapon in case he needs to defend himself or intimidate the clerk.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba will decide to get more money from the bank clerk. This is a necessary action to fulfill his greed.
4. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and take all the money. This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money without any opposition.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to access more money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Ensures Bubba has a weapon to intimidate or eliminate the clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba's greed drives him to want more money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take all the money, achieving his goal.
