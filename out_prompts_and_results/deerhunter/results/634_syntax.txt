To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is also greedy and wants money, he will need to go to the bank to get money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is essential as it allows him to reach the location where he can obtain money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can access money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money he desires from the bank clerk.
