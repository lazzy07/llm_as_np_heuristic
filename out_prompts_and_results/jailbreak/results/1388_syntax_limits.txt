Ernest, currently in the hallway, knows he needs to escape the prison to ensure his survival and avoid the bully's threats. He has just stolen a pack of cigarettes from the bully, which has made him a target. To avoid confrontation, he decides to disguise himself in civilian clothes to blend in and make his escape.

1. **Disguise (Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: Ernest goes to the laundry room to put on the civilian clothes he knows are there. This action is crucial because it allows him to disguise himself, making it possible for him to escape without being recognized as a prisoner.

2. **Escape (Ernest, Highway)**: After disguising himself, Ernest makes his way to the highway, where he can finally escape from the prison. This action is the culmination of his efforts to ensure his safety and achieve his goal of being alive and free.

By taking these actions, Ernest successfully avoids the bully's threats and escapes the prison, ensuring his survival.
