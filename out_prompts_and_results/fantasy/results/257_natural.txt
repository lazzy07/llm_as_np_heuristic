To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** This action is necessary for Rory to be in the same location as Vince, who has the money. Rory needs to be at the village to interact with Vince.

2. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** This action allows Rory to acquire the money, which is essential for achieving wealth.

3. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.** Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant for Rory's happiness but is included to maintain the narrative structure.

4. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** This action is included to ensure that Rory's happiness is acknowledged, even though they are already married.

5. **Rory and Talia get married.** This action solidifies Rory's happiness, as they are already married, but it reinforces the narrative.

6. **Rory becomes hungry.** This action is included to show that Rory's hunger status is being tracked, but it does not affect the outcome.
