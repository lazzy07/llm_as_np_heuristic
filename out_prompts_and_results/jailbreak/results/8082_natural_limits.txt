Ernest, aware of the bully's threat, decides to take a risk. He sneaks into the kitchen to grab the knife, knowing itâ€™s the only way to defend himself and Roy. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway, where he can lock the gym door and confront the bully. 

Once in the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door, preventing the bully from escaping. He then enters the gym, where the bully is still unaware of his presence. In a moment of confrontation, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that both he and Roy are no longer threatened.
