Zoe is currently in the cave, while the Lizard is on the surface. The surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard. 

To achieve this, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially make friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the cave. This is a strategic move to ensure she is safe from the erupting volcano while still maintaining her new friendship with the Lizard.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship from the cave. This ensures her safety as the volcano continues to erupt on the surface.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
