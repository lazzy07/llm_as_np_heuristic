To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are currently unknown, this assessment is crucial for the doctor to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment is appropriate. If Young does not have Flaze, this could lead to a mistake, but since the goal is for Young to be healthy, we will assume the assessment reveals a fever.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is not directly related to Young's health but is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to, which aligns with Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), this treatment is appropriate. If Jones does not have Jarkis, this could lead to a mistake, but the focus remains on ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Young will be treated correctly and achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
