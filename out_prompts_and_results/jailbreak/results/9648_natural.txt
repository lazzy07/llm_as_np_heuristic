**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and since he has the knife, he can use it to defend himself and Roy.

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Ernest to approach the bully without being seen, as the gym door is locked.)
2. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (This action allows him to enter the gym where the bully is.)
3. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both him and Roy, ensuring their safety.)

With the bully dead, Ernest can now return to Roy without fear of being threatened. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Crawling through the vents allows Ernest to bypass the locked door and approach the bully without being detected.
- Unlocking the gym door is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully directly.
- Killing the bully is the final action that ensures both Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened, allowing them to live without fear.
