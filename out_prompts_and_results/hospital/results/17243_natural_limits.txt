Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A first. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A and assesses Young. Since Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload remains at 2.

2. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions and admits Ross to Patient Room C. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

3. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones. Since Jones is also experiencing Unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.

4. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A and treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing Young has Flaze due to the Unknown symptoms. Fortunately, Young's condition aligns with Flaze, and Young becomes healthy.

By assessing Young and treating them, Dr. Hathaway successfully helps one patient become healthy, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
