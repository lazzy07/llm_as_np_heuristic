To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to reach the bank where the clerk is located to obtain the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which directly helps him achieve his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by returning Bubba to the forest after obtaining the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk.
- **Steal the money:** This is the action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
- **Return to the forest:** This action wraps up the story by bringing Bubba back to his original location.
