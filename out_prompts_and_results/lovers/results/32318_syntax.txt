To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to give or trade items.

2. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room. This allows both Casey and Blake to be in the same room, facilitating a potential trade or gift exchange.

3. **give(C3, I1, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey in the dining room. This is crucial because Casey can then give the jewelry to Alex.

4. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary for Casey to be able to give the jewelry to Alex.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the living room. This action fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.
