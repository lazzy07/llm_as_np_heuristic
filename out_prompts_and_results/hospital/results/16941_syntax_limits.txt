After walking to the admissions room, Hathaway sees that both Jones and Ross are waiting to be admitted. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 1, they can safely admit another patient without making a mistake.

1. **Admit Hathaway, Jones, ExamRoomB**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2.
2. **Admit Hathaway, Ross, ExamRoomC**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room C. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

5. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, ExamRoomB**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics for Flaze, successfully making him healthy. This reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2.
