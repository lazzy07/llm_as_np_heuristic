To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as she has already accepted his proposal. The story will involve Talia traveling to the cave to marry Vince, which will make her happy. After that, Vince can pick up the treasure in the cave, which will make Talia wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where Vince is located. This action is necessary for her to be with Vince and to proceed with the marriage.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince in the cave. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

3. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. This action ensures that Talia becomes wealthy, as Vince will share the treasure with her.

Now, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage) and wealthy (due to the treasure), achieving her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel**: Talia needs to be in the same location as Vince to marry him.
- **marry**: This action directly fulfills Talia's goal of happiness.
- **pickup**: By picking up the treasure, Vince ensures that Talia becomes wealthy, which is her other goal.
