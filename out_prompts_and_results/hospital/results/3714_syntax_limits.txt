**Story Completion:**

After admitting Young to Exam Room B, Hathaway returns to the Admissions room to assess the patients. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in the Admissions room. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway believes he is healthy. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are evaluated properly.

2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Jones shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes he is also healthy. This is crucial for Jones to be confirmed healthy.

3. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young in Exam Room B with steroids, believing Young has Jarkis. However, since Young has not shown any symptoms, this treatment is unnecessary but does not affect Jones's health.

4. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Finally, Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to confirm Jones's health status. 

At the end of these actions, Jones is confirmed healthy, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: Ensures that all patients are evaluated, which is part of Hathaway's goal to keep patients healthy.
- **Assess Jones**: Confirms Jones's health status, which is critical for him to feel secure about his well-being.
- **Treat Young**: Although unnecessary, it shows Hathaway's commitment to treating patients, which indirectly supports Jones's goal by maintaining a healthy environment.
- **Walk to Patient Room A**: Final confirmation of Jones's health, ensuring he feels safe and healthy.
