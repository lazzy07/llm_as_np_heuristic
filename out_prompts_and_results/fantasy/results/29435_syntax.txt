To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has accepted Vince's proposal, she will become happy through marriage. However, she also desires wealth, which can be achieved by acquiring the treasure in the cave. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village to be with Talia and Vince. This is necessary because Rory needs to be present to interact with Talia.
   
2. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels to the Cave to find the treasure. This is important because Gargax is hungry and needs to find food, but it also sets up the next action.

3. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory in the Cave. This action is crucial because it eliminates Rory, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince without Rory's presence.

4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince and Talia get married. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

5. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave to find the treasure. This is necessary for her to pursue her goal of wealth.

6. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action fulfills her desire for wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Vince) and wealthy (from acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel actions**: These are necessary to move characters to the appropriate locations for interactions and to achieve goals.
- **Eat action**: This is a pivotal moment that removes a character (Rory) from the equation, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince.
- **Marry action**: This directly fulfills Talia's desire for happiness.
- **Pickup action**: This fulfills Talia's desire for wealth by acquiring the treasure.
