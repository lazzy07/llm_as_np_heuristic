To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary actions:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B. Let's say Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever).
