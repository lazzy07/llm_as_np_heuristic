In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax the dragon. Talia has the treasure, and Vince has the money. To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the following actions take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince has, which will increase Gargax's wealth. This action also removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her own goals without the complication of Vince's presence.

2. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body.** After Gargax eats Vince, Talia can take the money that Vince had. This action increases Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals. With the treasure she already possesses and the money she takes from Vince, Talia becomes wealthy.

By completing these two actions, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy, which also contributes to her happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince:** This action is essential for Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth and to eliminate a competitor for Talia's attention and resources.
- **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body:** This action allows Talia to achieve her goal of wealth, as she now possesses both the treasure and the money.
