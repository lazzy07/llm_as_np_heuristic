To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I3) they have with Alex (C1) for the item that Casey (C3) has, which is the jewelry (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the chocolates they want, while Blake also gets an item they desire.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) will have the jewelry (I2) and will also be happy.
- Casey (C3) will still be unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this trade fulfills that requirement.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R22)**: This action allows Alex to get the chocolates they want, making them happy.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates they desire.
