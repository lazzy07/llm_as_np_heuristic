To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, to ensure the story flows logically, we can include a few actions that reinforce his situation and conclude the story.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba needs to go to the forest where Bambi is located.)
3. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition and can shoot Bambi to eat.)
4. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (Bubba can now satisfy his hunger by eating Bambi.)

After these actions, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money (since he already had it) and has also satisfied his hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and it sets the stage for him to take further actions related to eating.
- **Go from the bank to the forest:** This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest, allowing him to fulfill his hunger.
- **Shoot Bambi:** This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain food, as he needs to kill Bambi to eat.
- **Eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, completing his immediate needs.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to eat",
    "go from the bank to the forest",
    "shoot Bambi",
    "eat Bambi"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal while also addressing his hunger, creating a logical flow in the story.
