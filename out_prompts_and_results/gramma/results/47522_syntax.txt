To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to confront Tom and the merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit robs Tom, who is unarmed and carrying the medicine. The bandit takes the coin from Tom, increasing her wealth.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the camp to secure her coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:

- Robbing Tom is a strategic move since he is unarmed and the bandit can take his coin without any risk to herself.
- Walking back to the camp is necessary to secure her newly acquired wealth.
- Taking the coins from the chest ensures that the bandit maximizes her goal of having coins.
