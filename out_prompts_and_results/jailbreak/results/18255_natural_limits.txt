Ernest, realizing that he needs to protect himself and Roy from the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife. He also has the civilian clothes, which he can use to disguise himself later. 

To ensure his safety and that of his friend, Ernest makes a bold decision. He unlocks the gym door and enters, confronting the bully. With the knife in hand, he takes the opportunity to kill the bully before he can threaten them any further. This action not only eliminates the immediate threat but also allows Ernest to feel secure for the first time in a long while.

After killing the bully, Ernest can now safely put on the civilian clothes and escape from the prison on the highway, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Unlock the gym door**: This action is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully directly, as the gym is locked and he needs access to eliminate the threat.
2. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This is the critical action that ensures both Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to live without fear.
