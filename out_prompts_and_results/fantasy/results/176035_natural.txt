To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax, who is hungry and does not care about happiness, will eat Rory. This will lead to Rory's death, which will allow Gargax to satisfy their hunger and wealth goals by taking Rory's money.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money from Rory's dead body. This action fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave**: Gargax will then travel to the cave to find the treasure, which is part of their goal to be wealthy.

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure**: Finally, Gargax will pick up the treasure in the cave, further increasing their wealth.

At the end of these actions, Rory is no longer alive, and Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy and not hungry. Rory's happiness is not achieved due to their death, but since the goal is to ensure Rory achieves their goal, the story ends with Gargax fulfilling their desires instead.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Rory",
    "Gargax takes the money from Rory's body",
    "Gargax travels to the cave",
    "Gargax picks up the treasure"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions leads to Gargax achieving their goals while Rory's goals are ultimately unfulfilled due to the circumstances of the story.
