To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Gargax needs to go to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which is essential for achieving wealth.

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, which contributes to their wealth.

3. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Gargax needs to return to the village to ensure they are in a location where they can interact with the other characters and potentially secure their wealth.

4. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - Gargax is still hungry, and eating Rory will satisfy that hunger. Since Rory is alive and Gargax needs to fulfill their hunger, this action is necessary.

5. **Gargax takes the money from the dead body of Vince.**
