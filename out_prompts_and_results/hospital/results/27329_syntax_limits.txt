In this story, we need to ensure that Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will proceed with the assessment.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to the Admissions Room**: After treatment, Young will walk to the Admissions Room to confirm their health status and ensure they are officially discharged as healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:
