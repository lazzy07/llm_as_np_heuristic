Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that to ensure her safety and to foster a friendship with the Lizard, she must act quickly. 

To achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard. This action will solidify their friendship and ensure that they can work together to find safety from the volcano.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is chosen because it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard while also ensuring both characters can work together to find safety from the erupting volcano. By making peace, they can collaborate and potentially escape the danger together.

After this action, Zoe and the Lizard become friends, and they can now support each other in finding a safe location away from the volcano.
