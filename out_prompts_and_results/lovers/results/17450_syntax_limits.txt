To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Alex is currently in the bedroom (R11) and the flowers are with Casey in the living room (C3), Alex needs to take action to obtain them.

Hereâ€™s the shortest story:

1. **move(C1, R11, R22)**: Alex moves from the bedroom to the dining room, where they can access the living room.
2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room, where Casey is located with the flowers.
3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R11, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach the dining room, which is a step towards getting to the living room where the flowers are.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action allows Alex to enter the living room, where Casey is located with the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This action is crucial as it transfers the flowers from Casey to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
