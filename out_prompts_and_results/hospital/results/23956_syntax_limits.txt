**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Rash, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Ross is necessary to identify if he has Jarkis (rash) or Flaze (fever).

2. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. If Ross indeed has Jarkis, he will become healthy. This action is crucial for Hathaway to achieve their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions**: Hathaway then assesses Young in the Admissions room to check for symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated appropriately.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Ross**: This action is essential to determine Ross's condition. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.
  
- **Treating Ross**: This action directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy. If Ross has Jarkis, he will recover; if not, Hathaway risks a mistake due to high workload, but it is a necessary risk to take.

- **Assessing Young**: This action is important to ensure that Young is also evaluated for any symptoms, allowing Hathaway to address any potential health issues.
