To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the BanditCoin from her. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and the Merchant is unarmed and vulnerable in the Market.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the BanditCoin and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This is the first step to ensure the Bandit increases her coin count without risking confrontation with the Guard, who is also present in the Market.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins without the threat of being attacked or caught.
- **Taking the Coin to the Chest**: This final action secures the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, which is her ultimate objective.
