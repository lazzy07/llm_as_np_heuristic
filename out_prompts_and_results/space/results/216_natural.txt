Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, observing the vibrant landscape. The Lizard, the guardian of the surface, approaches her cautiously. Both characters are aware of each other's presence but have not yet established a relationship. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is taken because Zoe wants to make friends with other creatures, and the Lizard also desires friendship. By initiating peace, they can both achieve their goals of safety and friendship.

2. **The Lizard accepts Zoe's peace offer.** This is a necessary response to Zoe's action, as it solidifies their newfound friendship. The Lizard recognizes that Zoe is not a threat and that they can coexist peacefully.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** This action allows them to explore the cave together, fostering their friendship further and ensuring they are both safe and healthy in a shared environment.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard share stories in the cave.** This action deepens their bond and allows them to understand each other better, reinforcing their friendship.

5. **Zoe teleports back to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as she can monitor the planet from above and ensure that the Lizard remains safe on the surface.

By completing these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
