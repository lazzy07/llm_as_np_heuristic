1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the dangers of the surface, especially since the surface is currently dangerous. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being safe.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are in a safe location together.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can reaffirm their friendship in a safe environment. This action solidifies their bond and ensures that both characters feel secure and healthy.

By taking these actions, the Lizard successfully achieves its goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
