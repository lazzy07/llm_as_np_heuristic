To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the bedroom (R11) to get closer to the jewelry, which is located in the bedroom.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R11)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the bedroom (R11). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) to be in the same room as Casey, who is also in the dining room.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to themselves (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action is a bit redundant since Alex is already holding the jewelry, but it emphasizes that Alex has successfully obtained the item they wanted.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C1, R12, R11)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach the location of the jewelry.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R11)**: This action is essential as it allows Alex to acquire the jewelry, which is the key to their happiness.
- **move(C1, R11, R12)**: This action brings Alex back to the dining room, where they can interact with Casey.
- **give(C1, I1, C1, R12)**: This action reinforces that Alex has the jewelry, ensuring they are happy.
