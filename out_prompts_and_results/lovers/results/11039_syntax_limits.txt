In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are currently in the same room as Casey (C3), who has the flowers. Alex believes that Casey is in the living room (R21) and wants to make Casey happy as well. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R21)**: Alex can trade the flowers (I1) they want with Casey for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire (the flowers) while also ensuring that Casey is happy with the jewelry they receive in return.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, and Casey will also be happy because they have received jewelry in the trade.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade**: This action is chosen because it allows both characters to achieve their goals simultaneously. Alex gets the flowers they want, and Casey receives an item they presumably want (the jewelry), thus making both characters happy.
