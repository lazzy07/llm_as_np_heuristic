To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the bathroom where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the flowers. This is essential as it allows Blake to have the item that Alex wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room with the flowers. This is necessary to give the flowers to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
