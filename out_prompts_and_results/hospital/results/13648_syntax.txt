To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify his condition and provide treatment.

6. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This is the final step to ensure all patients are healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions taken:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's condition.
3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to treat Ross based on his symptoms.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to treat Young based on his symptoms.
5. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Jones based on his symptoms.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
