To achieve the goal of the Secret Agent, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The Secret Agent moves to the Office to confront the Mastermind. This is necessary because the Mastermind is believed to be at Headquarters, and the Secret Agent needs to be in a position to kill the Mastermind.

2. **move(Mastermind, Headquarters, Lobby)**: The Mastermind moves to the Lobby, believing the Secret Agent is still at Headquarters. This action is necessary for the Mastermind to be in the same location as the Secret Agent for the confrontation.

3. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The Secret Agent kills the Mastermind using the gun in the Office. This is the final action that achieves the Secret Agent's goal of ensuring the Mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is efficient and direct, leading to the desired outcome with minimal steps.
