To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that I2 is not in any character's possession, and we need to facilitate a series of actions that will lead to Blake obtaining I2.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I2) while in the dining room. This action is important because it informs Alex of Blake's desire, which may influence Alex's actions.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) to retrieve the jewelry (I2) that is currently with Casey. This is necessary for Alex to fulfill Blake's request.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) as well, following Alex. This is important because it allows for the potential exchange of items.

5. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item that Blake wants.

6. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) with the jewelry (I2) to give it to Blake.

7. **give(C1, I2, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake in the dining room (R12). This final action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2), which is what they wanted.
