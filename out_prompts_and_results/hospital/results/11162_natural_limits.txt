Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds with the assessment. After assessing Jones, she mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. She treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition (Flaze). As a result, Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting. She admits Ross to Patient Room B and assesses him. Since Ross is experiencing symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway correctly treats him with antibiotics, and he becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to admit Young to Patient Room C. She assesses Young and finds he has symptoms of Jarkis. She treats him with steroids, and he becomes healthy as well.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross and Young, achieving her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
