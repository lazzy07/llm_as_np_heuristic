**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room B, assesses Jones. Due to Hathaway's workload of 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. However, Hathaway assesses Jones and mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the unknown symptoms. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis but instead has Flaze, which means the treatment does not work. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, he does not die from the treatment error.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. Ross, who is still in Admissions, is then assigned to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is appropriate, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway, still under the burden of workload, mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young does not have Jarkis, but he remains alive and healthy.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.
