In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Crossroads, and the Bandit is at the Market, where she can potentially rob Tom, who is also at the Market. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks to the Market to be in a position to sell her medicine to Tom, who is currently at the Market. This action is necessary because it allows her to interact with Tom and potentially gain coins from him.

After this action, the Merchant can sell the medicine to Tom for a coin, thus achieving her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant walking to the Market is the only action needed to set up the transaction with Tom. Since Tom is looking for medicine and the Merchant has it, this action directly leads to the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins.
