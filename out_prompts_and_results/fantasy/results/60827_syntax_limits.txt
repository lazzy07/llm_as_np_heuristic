In the current situation, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. He has already proposed to Talia, and she has accepted, which means they can get married. However, Rory is currently in the Village, while Talia is in the Cave, where the Treasure is located. To achieve his goal, Rory needs to marry Talia and then acquire the Treasure.

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Rory's goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory travels to the Cave to be with Talia, where they can get married. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Talia to marry her.

2. **Marry Talia**: Once Rory arrives at the Cave, he marries Talia. This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness and also sets the stage for acquiring wealth, as Talia can help him with the Treasure.

After these actions, Rory will be happy due to his marriage to Talia. Although he hasn't directly acquired wealth yet, marrying Talia opens up the possibility of accessing the Treasure in the Cave, which can lead to wealth in the future.
