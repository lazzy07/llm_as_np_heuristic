To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, but she can only marry one of them. Since Vince currently has money, marrying him will make Talia wealthy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which will help her achieve her goal of wealth.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure from the cave, increasing her wealth.
3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village with the treasure.
4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which will make her happy since she has accepted his proposal and he has money.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Traveling to the cave** is essential for Talia to access the treasure, which is a key component of her goal to be wealthy.
- **Picking up the treasure** directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her primary goals.
- **Traveling back to the village** is necessary because Talia needs to be in the same location as Vince to marry him.
- **Marrying Vince** fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through a committed relationship, and since Vince has money, it also contributes to her wealth.

By following this sequence, Talia achieves both her goals of happiness and wealth.
