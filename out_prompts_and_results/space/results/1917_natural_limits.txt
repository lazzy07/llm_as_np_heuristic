Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous and that the Lizard is in peril, decides to help the Lizard. She teleports from the ship to the surface, where she finds the Lizard. Instead of fighting, she approaches the Lizard and offers her assistance, showing that she wants to be friends. The Lizard, seeing Zoe's intentions, accepts her offer, and they both work together to find shelter from the erupting volcano. 

This action is crucial because it allows Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe from the danger of the erupting surface. By choosing to teleport to the surface and then make peace instead of fighting, Zoe demonstrates her commitment to friendship and safety.
