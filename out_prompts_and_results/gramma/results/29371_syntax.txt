To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit moves to the merchant's location to confront her and potentially rob her of her coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Merchant)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs the merchant, taking the coins she is carrying. This action is possible because the merchant is not armed with a sword.

3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Camp)**: After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit walks back to her camp, now carrying the coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit places the coins into the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that her goal of having coins in the chest is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first walks to the merchant to initiate the robbery. This is necessary to confront the merchant and take her coins.
- The robbery is the critical action that allows the bandit to acquire coins without needing to kill anyone, thus avoiding unnecessary conflict and keeping her criminal status intact.
- Walking back to the camp is essential for the bandit to secure her loot in a safe location.
- Taking the coins to the chest fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins stored at the camp.
