To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and walk to the surface to check on the Lizard. This action is necessary to bring Zoe to the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for the next steps.

2. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attacks the Lizard. This action is taken to create a conflict that will lead to a resolution. Although Zoe and the Lizard are friends, the attack is a misunderstanding that will prompt them to resolve their differences.

3. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard stuns Zoe in response to the attack. This action is necessary to show that the Lizard is defending itself and to create a moment of vulnerability for Zoe.

4. **break_free(Zoe, Surface)**: Zoe breaks free from being stunned. This action allows Zoe to regain her agency and continue the story.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace after the misunderstanding. This action is crucial for them to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is the climax of the story, resulting in the death of one character.

7. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption kills the Lizard. This action concludes the story with the Lizard dying due to the eruption, while Zoe survives.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the tragic end.
