To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba will use his rifle to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the possible endings.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also fulfilling the condition of Bambi being dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires from the bank clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go**: This action allows Bubba to move to a new location (the forest) where he can encounter Bambi.
- **shoot**: This action allows Bubba to kill Bambi, satisfying the condition of Bambi being dead.
