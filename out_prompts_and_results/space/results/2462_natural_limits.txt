Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport from the ship to the surface to help the Lizard. She believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface, but she wants to make friends and ensure both of them are safe. Upon arriving on the surface, she sees the Lizard struggling with the volcanic activity. Instead of fighting, Zoe approaches the Lizard and offers her assistance. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, accepts her help, and they work together to find shelter from the eruptions. In this moment of cooperation, they form a bond and become friends.

However, as they are finding shelter, the volcano erupts violently, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise. Zoe, although devastated, realizes that they had formed a friendship before the tragedy struck.

1. Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface to help the Lizard, which is necessary to establish a connection and work towards friendship.
2. Zoe and the Lizard make peace, which is essential for them to become friends before the eruption occurs.
