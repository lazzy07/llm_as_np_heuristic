To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move away from Tom and the Guard, who are both in the Market, and to position herself for the next action.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to reach her camp where she can store the coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at her camp.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by moving to a safe location and securing the coins.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- The first action allows the Bandit to escape the immediate danger posed by Tom and the Guard, who are both in the Market.
- The second action is crucial for reaching her base of operations, where she can safely store her loot.
- The third action directly fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
