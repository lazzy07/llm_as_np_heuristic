Tom is at the Crossroads, carrying the medicine he needs to take back to the cottage. He sees the Bandit also at the Crossroads, who is a criminal and likely to cause trouble. To ensure he can safely return to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to attack the Bandit, as he is armed with a sword and the Bandit is not.

Tom attacks the Bandit, successfully killing her. After the Bandit is dead, Tom can loot the Bandit's body for any coins she might have. However, since Tom's goal is to return to the cottage with the medicine, he simply walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal.

The actions taken are:
1. **attack(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)**: Tom attacks the Bandit to eliminate the threat she poses, ensuring he can safely return to the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks back to the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
