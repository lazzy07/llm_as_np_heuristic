Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the spaceship for safety. However, this action makes the Lizard angry, as it perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to its guardianship of the surface. The Lizard, feeling threatened, decides to confront Zoe in the cave. 

In the cave, Zoe and the Lizard are now in the same location, and tensions rise. However, instead of fighting, Zoe takes a moment to communicate her intentions. She explains that she means no harm and is only trying to ensure both of their safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's perspective, agrees to make peace.
