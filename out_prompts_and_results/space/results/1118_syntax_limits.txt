Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware that the surface is dangerous, and they want to ensure their safety and health while also fostering a friendship.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she takes the opportunity to make peace with the Lizard again. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After solidifying their friendship, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action ensures her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she can now monitor the situation from the ship.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
