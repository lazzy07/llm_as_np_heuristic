In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake is also happy because they received the flowers in exchange.

This single action achieves Casey's goal of happiness while also ensuring Blake is happy, fulfilling both characters' desires.
