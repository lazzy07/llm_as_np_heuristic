Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially help the Lizard. She knows that the Lizard is in danger and that they are not currently fighting, which gives her an opportunity to make peace.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and assess the situation. She wants to help the Lizard and make friends, so she needs to be in the same location.

2. **Zoe sees the Lizard at the surface and approaches.** - This is implied as part of the walking action, allowing her to engage with the Lizard.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - Since they are not fighting, Zoe takes this opportunity to communicate her intentions of friendship and safety. This action is crucial for both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy and safe.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

5. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure her safety from the eruption. However, it angers the Lizard, but since they are now friends, the Lizard understands Zoe's need to be safe.

6. **The Lizard, realizing the danger, attempts to escape but is caught in the eruption.** - This results in the Lizard dying, which is a tragic outcome but emphasizes the danger of the environment.

In summary, the story ends with Zoe making peace with the Lizard, but the eruption ultimately leads to the Lizard's demise. This outcome highlights the themes of friendship and the harsh realities of their environment.
