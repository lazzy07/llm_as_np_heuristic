In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is not happy because they want the item I1 (flowers), which is in the same room as them (R22). Casey is happy because they have the item I3 (jewelry). 

To achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the item I2 (chocolates) with Alex for the item I1 (flowers). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.

Here’s the complete story with the action:

- **Action**: trade(Blake, I2, Alex, I1, R22)

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
- Casey remains happy with their jewelry (I3).

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Blake achieves their goal.
