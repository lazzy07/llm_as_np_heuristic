Bubba, feeling hungry and desperate for money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, driven by his hunger and greed, he aims the rifle at her. 

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to eat, and Bambi is a potential source of food. By shooting Bambi, he can satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, fulfilling his hunger.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can now take the money that he believes she has, achieving his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.
