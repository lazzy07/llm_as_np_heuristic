In the living room, Alex sees that Casey has the flowers. Since Alex wants the flowers to be happy, Alex decides to take action. 

**Action:** Alex moves to Casey and asks for the flowers.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary because Alex's goal is to obtain the flowers from Casey. By directly asking for the flowers, Alex can achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is still not happy because they still want the jewelry.

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, the story ends here.
