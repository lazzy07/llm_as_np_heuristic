To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the dining room and has the item Alex wants (flowers).

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This action is necessary for Casey to understand what Alex desires.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) to retrieve the flowers that are currently there.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers.

5. **move(C1, R21, R21)**: Alex remains in the living room, now happy because they have the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the item they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R12)**: This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Casey to communicate their desire.
- **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: This informs Casey of Alex's desire, which is essential for Casey to act on it.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey needs to go to the living room to get the flowers, which is where they are located.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.
- **move(C1, R21, R21)**: This action is redundant but indicates that Alex is now in the room where they are happy.
