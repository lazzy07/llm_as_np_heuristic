To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to eventually get the jewelry, which is their desired item.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) will give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Trade**: This action allows Blake to give away the jewelry to Casey in exchange for the flowers. It is a strategic move to ensure that Alex can eventually receive the jewelry.
- **Give**: This action is the final step where Casey hands over the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
