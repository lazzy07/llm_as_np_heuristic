To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Admissions to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated correctly, as he is in the same location as Jones.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. This ensures that all patients are healthy, aligning with Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat(Ross)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment results, ensuring he receives the correct treatment.
3. **Assess(Young)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat(Young)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment results.

This sequence of actions ensures that Ross is treated correctly and becomes healthy, achieving his goal.
