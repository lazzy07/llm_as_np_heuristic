In the living room, Alex sees the flowers and realizes that they want them. However, they also know that Casey is happy with the jewelry they received. To help Casey achieve their goal, Alex decides to tell Casey that Blake is in the bathroom and that Blake wants the flowers. This is a lie, but it will motivate Casey to give Alex the flowers, thinking it will make Blake happy.

Casey, believing Alex's words, decides to give the flowers to Alex, thinking it will help Blake. In return, Casey keeps the jewelry, which is what they want.
