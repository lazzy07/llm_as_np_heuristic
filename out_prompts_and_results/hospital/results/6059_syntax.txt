To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine her symptoms. This is also necessary to ensure that both patients are treated correctly.

3. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat her with steroids, which will also make her healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to Exam Room A**: After treating the other two patients, Hathaway will need to assess Jones. Therefore, Jones will walk from the admissions room to exam room A.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.
