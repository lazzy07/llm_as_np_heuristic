To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to approach the Lizard and initiate a friendly interaction.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important to find the Lizard and engage with it directly.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship and ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.

4. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk back to the surface. This action is to ensure that both characters can safely leave the cave area.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship. This action ensures her safety as the volcano is still a threat on the surface.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
