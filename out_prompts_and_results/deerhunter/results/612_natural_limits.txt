Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He goes from the bank to the forest where Bambi is. Bubba, with the rifle in hand, sees Bambi and decides to shoot. He loads the ammunition into the rifle and shoots Bambi, killing her. Bubba then eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger. With Bambi dead, he can take her meat back to the bank, where he can sell it for money. However, since the goal is for Bubba to have money, he decides to go back to the bank with the meat to trade for money.
