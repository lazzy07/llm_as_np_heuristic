In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) has the flowers (I3). Alex needs to get the jewelry from Casey to achieve their goal.

To achieve this, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
- Casey will be unhappy because they no longer have the jewelry.
- Blake's happiness remains unchanged.

This single action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
