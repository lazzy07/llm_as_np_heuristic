Dr. Hathaway, realizing that all patients are currently in the admissions room and experiencing unknown symptoms, decides to take immediate action to assess and treat them. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to be in the same location as the patients, allowing for assessments and treatments to be conducted.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.** This action is essential to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated. It also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload by one, but it is necessary to ensure that Ross receives care.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** This action is crucial for determining Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 2, he can accurately assess Ross without the risk of making a mistake.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** Assuming Ross has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one and achieves the goal of ensuring a patient is healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.
