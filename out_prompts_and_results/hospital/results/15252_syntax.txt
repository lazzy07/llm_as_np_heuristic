To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Similarly, Hathaway must assess Young to identify his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Jones to find out his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, making him healthy.

5. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, making him healthy.

6. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, making him healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
