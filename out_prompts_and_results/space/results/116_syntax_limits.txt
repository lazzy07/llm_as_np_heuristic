Zoe, the space explorer, is currently safe aboard her spaceship, but she knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface and in danger due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe wants to help the Lizard and make friends with him, but she also needs to ensure her own safety.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and offer assistance. She knows the Lizard is in danger and wants to help him.

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: By walking to the Lizard, Zoe shows her intention to approach him peacefully rather than teleporting again, which would anger the Lizard. This action is crucial for building a relationship.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is taken to establish a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends.

4. **The volcano erupts**: This event occurs as a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. Since Zoe is now friends with the Lizard, they can face the eruption together.

5. **The Lizard dies**: Unfortunately, despite their newfound friendship, the Lizard is unable to escape the eruption in time and perishes. This tragic ending highlights the dangers of the planet and the consequences of the volcanic activity.

In summary, the actions taken by Zoe are aimed at helping the Lizard and forming a friendship, but the eruption ultimately leads to the Lizard's demise. The story concludes with a bittersweet note, emphasizing the importance of friendship even in perilous situations.
