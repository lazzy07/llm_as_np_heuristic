**Story Completion:**

On day one, after finishing his chores in the laundry room, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to protect himself and Ernest from the bully. He sneaks into the kitchen, quickly grabs the knife, and then heads back to the hallway. 

Meanwhile, in the gym, Ernest is feeling the pressure of the bully's threats. He knows he needs to find a way to escape or defend himself. As Roy reaches the hallway, he hears the commotion from the gym and realizes he must act fast. 

Roy then crawls through the vents to the gym, where he finds Ernest still being threatened by the bully. With the knife in hand, Roy locks the gym door behind him, ensuring they are safe from any outside interference. He then confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation, kills him with the knife. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy and Ernest can now escape together. They quickly put on the civilian clothes that Roy stole earlier, disguising themselves. They then make their way to the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
