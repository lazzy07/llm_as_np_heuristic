Zoe and the Lizard are currently at the cave, having made peace and become friends. However, the surface is still dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to confront the danger of the erupting volcano directly, which is essential for the story to progress towards the volcano erupting.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is triggered by Zoe's presence on the surface, fulfilling the requirement for the volcano to erupt in the story.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This outcome is necessary to meet the condition of a character dying as a result of the eruption.

4. **The Lizard, witnessing Zoe's sacrifice, realizes the importance of friendship and the need to protect others.** - This realization leads to a deeper understanding of friendship and the value of connection, solidifying the bond between Zoe and the Lizard, even in Zoe's absence.

5. **The Lizard vows to honor Zoe's memory by becoming a guardian of peace and friendship on the planet.** - This action signifies the Lizard's commitment to fostering friendships with other creatures, ensuring that Zoe's legacy lives on.

The story concludes with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard's understanding of friendship deepens, fulfilling the requirement of two characters making friends (even posthumously).
