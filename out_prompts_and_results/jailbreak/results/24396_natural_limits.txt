**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, still in the kitchen, realized he needed to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He had the knife, which was a powerful tool in this dangerous environment. Knowing the bully was in the gym, Roy decided to take a risk.

Roy moved from the kitchen to the hallway, then crawled through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he found the bully lifting weights, unaware of Roy's presence. With the knife in hand, Roy approached the bully silently. 

In a swift motion, Roy plunged the knife into the bully, finally getting revenge for the threats against him and Ernest. The bully fell to the ground, lifeless, and Roy felt a surge of relief. He had eliminated the threat, ensuring both he and Ernest could live without fear.
