### Story Completion

After the bandit attacks the merchant, she stands over the merchant's body, holding the medicine. The hero, armed with the merchant's sword, sees the bandit and realizes that she has the medicine he needs. The guard, also armed, is aware of the chaos and is on high alert.

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to escape the immediate danger of the guard and take the medicine back to her safe location, the bandit camp.

2. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is unnecessary for the bandit’s goal but reflects the guard's instinct to pursue justice. However, it does not affect the bandit’s success.

3. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action secures the medicine in a safe place, ensuring that the bandit has achieved her goal of having the medicine in her possession.

### Explanation of Actions
- The bandit’s first action of walking to the bandit camp is crucial as it allows her to escape the market where she could be confronted by the guard or the hero. 
- The guard's action of reporting the bandit’s location does not hinder the bandit’s success but shows the guard's commitment to his role. 
- Finally, placing the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp is the definitive action that fulfills the bandit’s goal of having the medicine secured.
