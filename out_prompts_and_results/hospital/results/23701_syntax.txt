To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Jones, the first step is to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should walk to PatientRoomB to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms as well, ensuring that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently there. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are treated.

6. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Ross becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is necessary to identify the symptoms and determine the correct treatment for each patient.
- **Treating patients**: This is the ultimate goal of Hathaway, to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.
- **Walking between rooms**: This is required to move between patients and assess/treat them accordingly.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment_for_Jones, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_Young, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_Ross, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, the specific treatments for Jones, Young, and Ross would depend on the symptoms assessed, but the actions taken ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all patients healthy.
