To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess another patient. However, Ross is in Exam Room C, and Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is assessed and found to have a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway can treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway should assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is assessed and found to have a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Hathaway can treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young in Exam Room A to confirm his symptoms. Since Young has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway can treat him accordingly.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is confirmed to have a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway can treat him with steroids, ensuring that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of making them healthy.
