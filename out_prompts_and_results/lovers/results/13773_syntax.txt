To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R22) and has the jewelry (I1) from Casey (C2) after trading. However, Alex is still not happy because they also want Casey to be happy, and Casey wants the chocolates (I2), which are currently in the bathroom (R21). 

To make Alex happy, we need to ensure that Casey gets the chocolates. Here’s how we can complete the story:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the bathroom to get the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates from the bathroom.
   - This action allows Alex to obtain the item that Casey wants, which is essential for making Casey happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the dining room with the chocolates.
   - Alex needs to return to the dining room to give the chocolates to Casey.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates to Casey.
   - This action directly fulfills Casey's desire, making her happy.

5. **happy(C1) = True**: After giving the chocolates to Casey, Alex is now happy because they have made Casey happy.

Now, both Alex and Casey are happy, achieving Alex's goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I2, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "give(C1, I2, C2, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
