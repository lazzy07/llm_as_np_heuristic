To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the plan:

1. **Go from the Forest to the Bank**: Bubba will move to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **Steal the money from the Clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action will ensure that Bubba ends up with the money.

Now, let's explain each action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located. Without this action, Bubba cannot interact with the clerk or take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money, achieving the goal of having money.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is already dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
