Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, is currently at Patient Room A with Young, who is showing a rash. Since the rash indicates that Young has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** This action is necessary because it directly addresses Young's symptoms and aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. Since Young is treated correctly, he becomes healthy.

After this action, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1, and Young is now healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address Jones and Ross, who are still in Admissions and have unknown conditions. However, since the goal is to ensure at least one patient is healthy, and Young is now healthy, Hathaway has achieved their goal.

The story concludes with Young being healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's objective.
