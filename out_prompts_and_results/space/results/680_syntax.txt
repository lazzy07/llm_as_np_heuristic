To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard make peace, which will allow them to become friends. However, we will also have the volcano erupt, leading to a character's death. The goal is to ensure that the story ends with both characters as friends and the volcano erupting.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano starts to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending disaster.
   
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship in the cave, which is a safe location away from the danger of the volcano. This action is crucial as it fulfills their goal of making friends.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action is necessary to conclude the story with the eruption and the consequences that follow.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, in a tragic turn of events, dies due to the eruption while trying to protect Zoe. This action is included to ensure that one character dies as per the requirements.

The final story sequence leads to both characters achieving their goals of friendship, while also fulfilling the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt**: Initiates the volcanic eruption, creating a dangerous situation.
- **make_peace**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their desire for companionship.
- **erupt**: Causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the consequences of the story.
- **kill**: Results in the death of the Lizard, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
