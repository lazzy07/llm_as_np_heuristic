The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take action at the market where she knows the merchant is present with the medicine. 

1. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads. This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the crossroads where she can confront the merchant and potentially take the medicine.
