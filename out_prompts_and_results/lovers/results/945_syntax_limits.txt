In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the flowers (I1), while Casey wants to be happy with the chocolates (I2). Blake, who is currently in the living room (R22), wants to help Alex be happy. 

To achieve this, Blake can take the following action:

1. **trade(Blake, I2, Alex, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake is also happy because they have given away the chocolates (I2) to help Alex.

The story is complete with just this one action, as it fulfills Alex's goal of happiness.
