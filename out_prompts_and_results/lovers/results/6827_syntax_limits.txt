In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are currently not happy. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is also in the same room but is not happy either. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, thus making them happy.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the living room (R22).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they now have the jewelry they wanted.
- Casey will still be unhappy because they do not have the item they want (the chocolates).
- Blake will remain unhappy as well, but Alex's happiness is the priority.

This action is necessary and sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"]
}
