**Story Completion:**

After assessing Jones in Patient Room A, Hathaway realizes that Jones has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake, but since Jones is the only patient in the room, Hathaway confidently decides to treat him.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address Ross and Young, who are still in the admissions room. Since Hathaway's workload is now reduced to 2 after treating Jones, he can safely assess the next patient without the risk of making a mistake.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy.

Now, Hathaway has successfully treated both Jones and Ross, ensuring they are both alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to treat Jones, as he is the only patient in the room and has a clear diagnosis. This is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
- Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, which is necessary to determine his condition and provide appropriate treatment.
- Assessing Ross allows Hathaway to identify the correct disease (Jarkis) and proceed with the right treatment.
- Finally, treating Ross with steroids ensures that he also becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
