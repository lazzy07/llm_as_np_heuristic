**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - Young is experiencing Fever, which indicates he has Flaze. By treating him with antibiotics, Dr. Hathaway ensures that Young becomes healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to return to the admissions area to admit another patient, which is part of her goal to ensure all patients are healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - Jones is currently in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload but is essential for patient care.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to be present in Patient Room B to assess and treat Jones, who has just been admitted.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown.**  
   - Although Jones's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway must assess him to determine the next steps for treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with steroids.**  
   - Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly treats him for Jarkis (the only other disease), which is a risk due to her workload. However, this action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives treatment, and it is the only option available.
