**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing he is threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He sneaks back through the vent to the kitchen, where he knows the knife is located. Once in the kitchen, he quickly grabs the knife. With the knife in hand, he makes his way to the gym, where the bully is still occupied with his workout. 

Ernest locks the gym door behind him, ensuring that they are alone. With the knife ready, he confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation and self-defense, he kills the bully. Now, with the threat eliminated, Ernest can breathe a sigh of relief. He takes a moment to collect himself and then heads back to the hallway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. 

Disguised and free from the bully's threat, Ernest makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison.
