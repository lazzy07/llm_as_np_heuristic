To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Since Young is already assigned to PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.
