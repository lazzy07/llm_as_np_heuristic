The bandit, having just robbed the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the guard is stationed. The bandit reports her own location to the guard, misleading him into thinking that she is at the crossroads. This allows her to remain undetected while she keeps the hero's coin.

Next, the bandit walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely return to her camp with the hero's coin. With the coin now in her possession, she has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
