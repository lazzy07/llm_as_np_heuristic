In this story, the Merchant's goal is to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, and she prefers to be at the market. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Crossroads with Tom and the Bandit. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks to the Market. This action is necessary because it allows her to return to her preferred location, where she can continue her business without the risk of being involved in criminal activities.

This single action is sufficient for the Merchant to achieve her goal of being at the market, where she can safely conduct her trade and potentially earn more coins in the future.
