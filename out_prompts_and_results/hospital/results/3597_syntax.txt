To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is essential because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is vital for Jones to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
