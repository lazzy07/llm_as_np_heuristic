To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis will travel to the USA, believing they can find the Ark there. This action is necessary because they need to confront Indiana Jones and the US Army to achieve their goal of immortality.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: The US Army, armed and aware of the Nazis' intentions, will take the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is crucial as it directly leads to the US Army obtaining the Ark.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army will then open the Ark in the USA. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, this is a strategic move to eliminate the threat posed by the Nazis.

4. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: The Nazis, believing they can still claim the Ark, will attempt to take it from the US Army. However, since the Ark is now open and dangerous, they will also perish in the process.

5. **travel(Jones, USA, Tanis)**: Indiana Jones will travel to Tanis to ensure that the Ark is no longer a threat and to confirm the fate of the Nazis.

6. **open(Jones, Ark, Tanis)**: Finally, Indiana Jones will open the Ark in Tanis, ensuring that the Ark is destroyed and that no one can use it for nefarious purposes.

By following this sequence of actions, the US Army ends up with the Ark, and the Nazis are eliminated, achieving the desired outcome.
