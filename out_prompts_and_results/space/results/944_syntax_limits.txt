Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment increasingly dangerous. She knows that her safety and the safety of the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, are at risk. To ensure both of them can be healthy and safe, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship and ensuring they can work together to escape the impending danger.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**  
This action is taken to establish a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. By making peace, they can collaborate to find a safe solution to the erupting volcano and ensure their mutual safety.
