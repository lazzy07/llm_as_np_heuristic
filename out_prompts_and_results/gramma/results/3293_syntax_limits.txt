**Story Completion:**

After the events that transpired in the market, Tom, now carrying the medicine, realizes that the bandit is still present and poses a threat. To ensure his safety and to achieve his goal of returning to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard.

1. **report(Tom, Bandit, Market)**: Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the presence of a criminal, which aligns with the guard's goal of eliminating criminals. By doing this, Tom ensures that the bandit will be dealt with, allowing him to safely leave the market.
