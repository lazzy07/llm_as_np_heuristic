To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, USA)**: The US Army, being armed, will take the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is necessary because the Nazis currently possess the Ark, and the US Army needs to acquire it to fulfill Indiana's goal of having the Ark.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: After taking the Ark, the US Army will open it. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, this is a strategic move to eliminate the Nazis, as they believe the Ark is safe and will not anticipate the danger.

3. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: The Nazis, believing they are safe, will attempt to take the Ark back from the US Army. However, since the Ark is dangerous, this will lead to their demise as well.
