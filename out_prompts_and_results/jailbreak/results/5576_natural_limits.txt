Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that he has the knife, which gives him a chance to confront the bully. 

Ernest moves from the hallway to the gym, where he finds the bully. He uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Roy. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on getting a pack of cigarettes from Roy without fear of retaliation.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses the immediate threat to Ernest and Roy's lives. By killing the bully, Ernest ensures their safety and can later negotiate for the cigarettes without fear of being threatened.
