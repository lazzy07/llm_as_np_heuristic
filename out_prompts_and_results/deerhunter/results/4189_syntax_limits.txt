To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money. After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money without any resistance.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome where Bubba has the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba obtaining the money is achieved.
