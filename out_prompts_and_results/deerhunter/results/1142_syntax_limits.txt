To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: If we want to ensure that Bambi is dead as well, Bubba can then go to the forest and shoot Bambi. This action is not strictly necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money, but it fulfills the additional condition of Bambi being dead.

However, to keep the story as short as possible while still achieving the goal, we can limit it to just the first two actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk and take the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank.

Thus, the final story is:

1. Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle he loaded earlier.
2. Bubba picks up the money from the bank.

This results in Bubba having the money, fulfilling the primary goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only person standing between him and the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money after the clerk has been dealt with.
