In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I3 (which is in the room R22), and both Casey (C3) and Blake (C2) are also in R22. Since Alex is not happy, they need to take action to obtain I3. 

The simplest action for Alex to achieve their goal is to pick up I3 from the room they are currently in (R22). This action will make Alex happy, as they will have the item they want.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the item I3 from the room R22. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have I3.
- Casey and Blake will still be unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, the story ends here.

### Explanation of the action:
- The action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want (I3). Since the story only requires Alex to achieve their goal, this single action suffices.

### JSON Object with the final plan:
```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I3, R22)"]
}
