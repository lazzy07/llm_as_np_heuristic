To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and it will lead to Rory's death, allowing Gargax to gain wealth from the treasure.
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure, which fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth.
3. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince will travel to the cave to confront Gargax and potentially retrieve the treasure.
4. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince proposes to Talia, which will make them both happy.
5. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia accepts the proposal, leading to their happiness.
6. **Vince and Talia get married**: This solidifies their happiness and fulfills Vince's goal of being happy.

In this story, Rory's goal is achieved indirectly through the actions of Gargax, as Rory's death leads to the treasure being taken, which ultimately contributes to the happiness of Talia and Vince. Rory's hunger is not a concern since Gargax's actions lead to a resolution of the story.
