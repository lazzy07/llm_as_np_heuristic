The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the guard is now the only threat. She decides to take action to secure her goal of obtaining coins. 

1. The bandit attacks the guard. This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the only character who poses a threat to her and her goal of acquiring coins. By attacking the guard, she can potentially loot his sword and any coins he may have.

2. After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit loots the guard's corpse. This action allows the bandit to take the guard's sword and any coins he may have, furthering her goal of accumulating wealth.

With the guard dead, the bandit can now safely return to the bandit camp with her coins and the sword, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
