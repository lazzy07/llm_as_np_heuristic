**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that Roy is in the gym, but he also knows that the bully is there, threatening both of them. 

Ernest decides to take action to ensure both he and Roy can escape safely. He crawls back through the vents to the gym, where he knows Roy is located. 

Once in the gym, Ernest locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully and gives Ernest and Roy a chance to confront him without the risk of being interrupted or threatened by others.

With the gym door locked, Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously left there. He then confronts the bully, who is now trapped inside the gym with them. 

In a moment of desperation and self-preservation, Ernest kills the bully with the knife. This action is necessary to eliminate the threat that the bully poses to both him and Roy.

With the bully no longer a danger, Ernest and Roy can now safely escape. They both put on civilian clothes, and since Ernest is already disguised, they make their way to the highway together. 

Once on the highway, they successfully escape from the prison, achieving their goal of staying alive and free.
