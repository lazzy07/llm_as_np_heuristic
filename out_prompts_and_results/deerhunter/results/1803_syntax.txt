To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene and avoid any potential consequences of his actions.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, indicating that he is still hungry after his actions. This is a natural progression for his character, as he has not eaten yet.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank, which may seem counterintuitive, but it sets up the next action.

6. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk, ensuring that there are no witnesses to his crime. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his escape without being caught.

7. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba goes back to the forest, solidifying his escape with the stolen money.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger and ensuring he is not caught.
