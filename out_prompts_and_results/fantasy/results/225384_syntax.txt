To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will increase Rory's happiness and wealth while ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave to be with Talia and Vince, where he can interact with them and potentially increase his happiness.
   
2. **propose(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory proposes to Talia, which is a step towards increasing his happiness. Since Talia has already proposed to Rory, this action is valid and will lead to a positive outcome.

3. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal, which makes both of them happy.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory and Talia get married, which increases their happiness further.

5. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with Talia, where they can enjoy their new relationship.

6. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money from Vince, which increases his wealth.

Now, Rory is happy (due to marriage with Talia), wealthy (after picking up the money), and not hungry (as he has not taken any actions that would make him hungry).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling**: Rory needs to be in the same location as Talia to propose and marry her.
- **Proposing and Accepting**: These actions are necessary for Rory to achieve happiness through marriage.
- **Marrying**: This solidifies their relationship and increases happiness for both characters.
- **Picking up Money**: This action directly increases Rory's wealth, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy.
