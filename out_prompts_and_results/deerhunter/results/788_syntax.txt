To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, he is greedy, and he is hungry. The bank clerk is also present, and he has some money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving up his money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it aligns with his needs after the theft.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: Bubba will then go back to the house. This action is necessary for him to find a place to eat and possibly rest after his actions at the bank.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action satisfies his hunger and completes his immediate needs after the theft.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba takes the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger, which is a necessary step for his survival.
- **go**: Bubba moves to a safe location (the house) to eat and rest.
- **eat**: Bubba consumes Bambi, fulfilling his hunger.
