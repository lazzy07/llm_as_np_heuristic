To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit attacks the hero.** This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the hero, who is armed and poses a threat. By attacking the hero, the bandit can potentially loot the hero's sword and any coins the hero may have.

2. **The bandit loots the hero's coin.** After successfully attacking the hero, the bandit can loot the hero's coin, which will help the bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action is taken to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that the bandit has a safe place to store her loot.

4. **The bandit places the coin in the chest.** This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Attack the hero:** The bandit needs to eliminate the hero to avoid any further threats and to gain access to the hero's possessions.
