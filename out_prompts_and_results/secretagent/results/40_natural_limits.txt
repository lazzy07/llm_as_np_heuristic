The secret agent, now in the office with the papers and the gun, realizes that the mastermind is still alive and poses a threat. To eliminate this threat, the secret agent decides to take decisive action.

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. (This action is necessary to confront the mastermind, who is believed to be in the lobby.)
2. The secret agent kills the mastermind with the gun. (This action directly achieves the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.)

After these actions, the secret agent is alive, and the mastermind is dead, fulfilling the secret agent's objective.
