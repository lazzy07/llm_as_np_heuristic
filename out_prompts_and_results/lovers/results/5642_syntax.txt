To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **put_down(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear the space and may assist in future interactions.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21). This action allows Blake to be present in the same room as Alex and Casey, which may be important for future interactions.

5. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the flowers (I3). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps Blake achieve their own happiness by obtaining the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
