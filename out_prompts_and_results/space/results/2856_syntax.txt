Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. The Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is also present, and both characters are in a precarious situation. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, while the Lizard desires the same.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety from the volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are out of immediate danger.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, solidifying their newfound friendship and ensuring both characters are safe from the erupting volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from harm. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions to move to safety.

By making peace and moving to the cave, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
