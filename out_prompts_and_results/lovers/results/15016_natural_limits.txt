In the living room, Alex sees that Casey has the flowers. Knowing that they want the flowers to be happy, Alex decides to take action. 

**Action:** Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary because it directly communicates Alex's desire to Casey, who currently has the flowers. By expressing this, Alex hopes to encourage Casey to give them the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is not happy because they still want the jewelry.

However, Alex's goal of being happy is achieved.
