To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba eats the clerk.** (Bubba is hungry and can eat the dead clerk.)

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and satisfies his hunger by eating the clerk. Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his greed and obtain the money he desires.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, thus enabling Bubba to take the money.
- **Eat the clerk:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger after he has killed the clerk.
