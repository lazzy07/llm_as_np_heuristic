To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine if they have any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment needed.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: Since Ross is currently in the Admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will need to admit Ross to Exam Room A. This is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated if needed.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine if he has any symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross is also treated appropriately.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that both Young and Ross are healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Young)**: This action is taken to identify Young's symptoms.
