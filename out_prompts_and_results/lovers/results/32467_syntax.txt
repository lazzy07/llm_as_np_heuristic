To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) will trade the flowers (I3) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy, and Casey has it.

2. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: After the trade, Alex will move to the dining room (R22) to be in a different room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to illustrate movement in the story.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey will also move to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex. This action is included to show the interaction between characters.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey will give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it ensures that Alex receives the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which makes them happy.
