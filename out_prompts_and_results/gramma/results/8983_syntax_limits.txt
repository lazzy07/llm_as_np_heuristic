To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to leave the bandit camp and head to the cottage. Since he is currently at the camp with the medicine, he can simply walk to the cottage.

Hereâ€™s the story:

1. **Action**: `walk(Tom, Camp, Cottage)`

This action is necessary because Tom needs to move from the bandit camp, where he currently is, to the cottage, which is his desired location. Since he is already carrying the medicine, this action directly fulfills his goal.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Camp, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This is the shortest and most efficient way for Tom to achieve his goal.
