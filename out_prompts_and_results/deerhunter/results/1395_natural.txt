Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk.

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his desire for money. The clerk, believing Bubba has a loaded rifle, will comply and hand over the money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: After obtaining the money, Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any potential consequences and to find a place to eat.

4. **Bubba decides to eat**: Now that Bubba has the money, he can satisfy his hunger by eating something in the forest.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money and satisfies his hunger without unnecessary violence.
