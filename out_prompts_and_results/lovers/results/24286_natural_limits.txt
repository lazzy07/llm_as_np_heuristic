In the living room, Alex holds the jewelry and is not happy because they want the flowers. Blake is also in the living room, unhappy because they want the chocolates. Casey, in the dining room, wants the jewelry but believes it is with Alex.

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the following action occurs:

1. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.** This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to obtain the jewelry.

Once Casey is in the living room, they can see that Alex has the jewelry. Since the story only allows for one action to achieve Casey's goal, we stop here.

**Explanation of the action:**
- Casey moving to the living room is essential for them to interact with Alex and potentially obtain the jewelry, which is their desired item.
