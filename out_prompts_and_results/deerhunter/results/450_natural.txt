To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential target.

2. **Bubba picks up Bambi.**  
   - This action is not explicitly listed in the available actions, but it is implied that Bubba can interact with Bambi in the forest. Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and since Bambi is alive, Bubba may consider taking Bambi's life to eat or to use as leverage.

3. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to prepare the rifle for potential use against Bambi. Loading the rifle is a strategic move to ensure Bubba can defend himself or threaten Bambi if needed.

4. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - This action is taken to fulfill Bubba's hunger and to obtain a resource (Bambi's meat) that can be consumed. Since Bambi is a deer, Bubba can eat Bambi if it is dead.

5. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - After killing Bambi, Bubba decides to eat the animal. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to regain strength.

6. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank, where the clerk is located. Bubba needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money.

7. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now threaten the clerk to hand over the money. This action directly achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully acquires the money while also addressing his hunger.
