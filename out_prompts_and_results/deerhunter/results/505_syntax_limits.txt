To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares him to either threaten someone or hunt an animal, which is essential for achieving his greedy goal of obtaining money or food.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to utilize the dead animal for sustenance, which is a logical step after having killed it.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Although Bubba already decided to get money earlier, this action can be interpreted as him reaffirming his greed after having satisfied his hunger. However, since he has not yet acquired any money, this action does not directly contribute to the ending but reinforces his greedy nature.

The story ends with Bubba having satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi, and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the ending.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcome with minimal actions, ensuring Bubba's goals are met while also fulfilling the story's requirements.
