**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he has the cigarettes that the bully wants. 

Roy decides to crawl through the vents from the hallway to the gym. This action is crucial because it allows him to avoid the bully's line of sight while still being able to confront him. Once inside the gym, Roy sees the bully, who is unaware of his presence. 

With the knife in the kitchen still unaccounted for, Roy knows he must act decisively. He quickly locks the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action is necessary to prevent the bully from escaping and threatening them further. 

Now that the bully is locked in, Roy confronts him. He uses the element of surprise to his advantage and kills the bully with a knife he had secretly taken from the kitchen earlier. This action ensures that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to live in peace.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely escape through the highway, where he can blend in with the civilian clothes he is wearing. This final action fulfills his goal of being alive and free.
