To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk from the Cottage to the Crossroads. This action is included to ensure the Bandit is no longer at the Cottage, which is important for Tom's safety.

3. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to allow Tom to return to the Crossroads after ensuring the Bandit is not at the Cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the Crossroads back to the Cottage, this time carrying the medicine. This action completes Tom's goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

The sequence of actions ensures that Tom can safely reach the Cottage with the medicine without encountering the Bandit, who has moved to the Crossroads.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows Tom to achieve his goal while considering the actions of the other characters in the story.
