To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy (or both), we can focus on the relationships and the items they possess. Since Talia has treasure and both Rory and Vince have proposed to her, the best course of action is for Talia to accept one of the proposals, which will make her happy. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

This single action is sufficient to ensure Talia's happiness, as she has accepted a proposal from Rory, who is also present in the village. 

The final state of the characters is:
- Talia is happy because she accepted Rory's proposal.
- Rory is happy because Talia accepted his proposal.
- Vince remains in a proposed state but does not affect Talia's happiness.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["accept(Talia, Rory, Village)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively meets the goal of making Talia happy with the minimum number of actions.
