**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first admit Ross and Young to their respective exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is already in Patient Room A.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A.** (Assuming Jones has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure Jones receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.)
6. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross.)
7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.)
8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Ross has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.)
9. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young.)
10. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.)
