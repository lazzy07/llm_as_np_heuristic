To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the crossroads where the chest is located, allowing her to potentially access the coins.

2. **The bandit loots the hero.**  
   - The bandit can rob the hero because the hero is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin, increasing her total coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - After acquiring the hero's coin, the bandit needs to return to her camp to secure her coins in the chest.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the crossroads to position herself for the next action.
- By robbing the hero, the bandit increases her wealth without risking confrontation with the guard, who is at the market.
- The bandit then returns to her camp to secure her coins, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.
