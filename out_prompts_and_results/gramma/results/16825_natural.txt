To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant**: The bandit uses one of her swords to rob the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, increasing her coin count.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk back to her camp, where she can store her newly acquired coins.

3. **The bandit places the coins in the chest**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit places the coins in the chest, ensuring that she has coins secured in her camp.

These actions are necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The first action directly increases her coin count, while the subsequent actions ensure that she secures her gains.
