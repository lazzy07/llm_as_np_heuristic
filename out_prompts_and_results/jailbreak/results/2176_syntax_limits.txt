**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to head to the gym to check on Ernest. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is threatened. 

1. **Action: Go (Roy, Hall)** - Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway to get closer to the gym where Ernest is located. This action is necessary for Roy to reach Ernest and assess the situation with the bully.

2. **Action: Lock_gym (Roy, Gym)** - Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside with Ernest. This action is crucial as it prevents the bully from threatening either of them and gives them a chance to deal with the situation safely.

- The first action allows Roy to move closer to Ernest, who is in a dangerous situation with the bully.
