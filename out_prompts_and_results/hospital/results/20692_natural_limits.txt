Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, assesses Jones, who is also in Patient Room C. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to accurately assess Jones without making a mistake. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway determines that Jones has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also in Patient Room C. Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms as well, but Dr. Hathaway, still with a workload of 2, assesses him accurately. Dr. Hathaway determines that Ross has Jarkis due to the rash symptom. However, since the goal is for Jones to be healthy, the story ends here with Jones achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
