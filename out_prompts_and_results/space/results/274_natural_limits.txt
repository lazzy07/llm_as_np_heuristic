Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the surface to help her friend. However, as she teleports, the volcano erupts violently, causing chaos. The Lizard, seeing Zoe appear, instinctively feels threatened and prepares to defend its territory. 

Zoe, understanding the Lizard's reaction, quickly makes peace again, reassuring the Lizard that she is there to help. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, calms down, and they both work together to find a safe spot away from the lava flow. 

However, the eruption intensifies, and in a tragic turn of events, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and dies, despite their efforts to escape. Zoe, devastated by the loss of her friend, vows to honor the Lizard's memory and protect the planet in its stead.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is crucial to ensure that the Lizard understands Zoe's intentions and does not see her as a threat, allowing them to work together.
3. **The Lizard dies due to the eruption**: This is the tragic outcome of the story, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying while also highlighting the dangers of the erupting volcano.
