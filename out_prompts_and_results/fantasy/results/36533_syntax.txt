To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. The following story outlines the necessary actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the cave to the village to be with Talia and Vince, as he needs to interact with them to achieve his goals.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince, who is currently in the village. This action increases Rory's wealth, which is essential for him to achieve his goal.

3. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is necessary to create a situation where he can then eat and satisfy his hunger.

4. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave, where the treasure is located. This is important for him to potentially acquire more wealth.

5. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action further increases his wealth, helping him achieve his goal.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. Although this action seems counterproductive, it is necessary to conclude the story as it leads to Rory's demise, which is a part of the narrative structure.

After these actions, Rory has achieved his goal of being wealthy (through the money and treasure), but he is no longer alive, which is a necessary conclusion for the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling**: Rory needs to move between locations to interact with other characters and acquire items.

- **Eating by Gargax**: This action concludes the story, fulfilling the narrative requirement while also highlighting the dangers present in the cave.
