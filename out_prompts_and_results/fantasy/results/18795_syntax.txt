To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged. The quickest way to achieve Talia's happiness is through marriage, which will make both her and Rory happy. Since Talia is currently in the Cave and Rory is in the Village, she needs to travel back to the Village to marry him. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels from the Cave to the Village to be with Rory, who is waiting for her there. This action is necessary for Talia to be able to marry Rory.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Once Talia arrives in the Village, she marries Rory. This action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of becoming happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: This action is essential for Talia to reach Rory so that they can get married.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage, as she is now married to Rory.

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goal of happiness.
