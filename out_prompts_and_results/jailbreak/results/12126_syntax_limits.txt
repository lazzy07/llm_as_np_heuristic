**Story Completion:**

After Ernest successfully disguised himself with civilian clothes on the highway, he realized he needed to act quickly to escape the prison. He knew that Roy was still in the laundry room, and the bully was a constant threat to both of them. 

Ernest decided to take a risk. He crawled back through the vents to the laundry room to warn Roy about the bully's threats and to help him escape. However, as he reached the laundry room, he found that the bully had already made his way there, having threatened Roy and taken the pack of cigarettes back. 

Seeing the bully cornering Roy, Ernest knew he had to act. He quickly grabbed the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously planned to use for protection. With the knife in hand, he confronted the bully in the laundry room. In a desperate struggle, Ernest managed to kill the bully, finally overcoming the threat that had loomed over them.

With the bully dead, Ernest and Roy could now escape together. They quickly put on the civilian clothes and made their way to the highway, where they could finally leave the prison behind.
