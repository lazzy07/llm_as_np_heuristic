To achieve Vince's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to ensure he acquires the treasure while maintaining his happiness. Since Talia is at the cave with Rory and Gargax, and Vince is at the village with the money, he needs to travel to the cave to access the treasure. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to reach the location where the treasure is located.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which contributes to his wealth.

3. **Vince becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to reflect the natural consequence of traveling and picking up the treasure, as it is important for the story's flow.

4. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, as he consumes Vince, who has just picked up the treasure.

5. **Vince's treasure is taken by Gargax.**  
   - This is a consequence of Gargax eating Vince, and it results in Gargax becoming wealthy.

In this story, Vince does not achieve his goal of being happy and wealthy because he is eaten by Gargax. However, the actions taken are necessary to illustrate the dynamics between the characters and their goals.
