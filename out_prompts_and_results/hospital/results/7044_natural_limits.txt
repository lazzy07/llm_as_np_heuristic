Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the appropriate care and is no longer in the admissions room.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** (This action is crucial to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the correct treatment.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** (Assuming Ross has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. If he has Jarkis, this would be a mistake, but the goal is to treat him.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway ensures that all patients are assessed and treated, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Admitting Jones**: Moves Jones to an exam room where he can be treated, reducing the number of patients in admissions.
- **Assessing Ross**: Identifies Ross's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.
- **Treating Ross**: Aims to cure Ross based on the assumption of his disease, which is critical for achieving the goal of having healthy patients.
- **Assessing Young**: Ensures that Young is also evaluated for treatment, completing the cycle of care for all patients.
