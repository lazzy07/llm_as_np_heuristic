To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to get the money that he believes the bank clerk has. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where he can potentially acquire money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint, ensuring that he ends up with the money he desires.
