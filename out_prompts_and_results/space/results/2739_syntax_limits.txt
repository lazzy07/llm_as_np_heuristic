Zoe, realizing that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano, decides to take action. She teleports from the cave to the surface to confront the Lizard, hoping to make peace and establish a friendship before the volcano erupts.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to find the Lizard and address the situation directly. This action is necessary as she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the importance of cooperation for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring safety.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe and the Lizard are making peace, the volcano erupts unexpectedly. This action concludes the story with the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying, as the eruption is lethal.

In this story, Zoe's actions are focused on achieving her goal of friendship and safety, while the eruption serves as a dramatic conclusion that also aligns with the narrative's tension.
