To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first reduce the workload by treating one patient correctly, which will allow Hathaway to assess the others without the risk of error.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is found to have a rash (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway treats them with steroids. This will ensure Young becomes healthy, reducing the workload to 2.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway then assesses Ross to determine their symptoms. With the workload now at 2, there is no risk of error.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway treats them with antibiotics, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine their symptoms. 

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway treats them with antibiotics, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
