To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk, as he has a loaded rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, which will eliminate the threat and allow him to take the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and Bambi is already dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
- **Shooting the clerk**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, making it possible for Bubba to take it.
- **Picking up the money**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
