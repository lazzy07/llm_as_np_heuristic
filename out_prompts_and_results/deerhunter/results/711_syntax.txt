To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and is greedy for money. The bank clerk has money, and Bubba is hungry, which may influence his actions.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest to find Bambi. He can then eat Bambi, which fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead. This action is included to ensure that both conditions of the ending are satisfied.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to move from the bank to the forest where Bambi is located. 

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. Bubba shoots the bank clerk to take the money.
2. Bubba goes to the forest.
3. Bubba eats Bambi.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi after acquiring the money.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, satisfying the second condition of the ending. 

By following this plan, we achieve the desired outcome of Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.
