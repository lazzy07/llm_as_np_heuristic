To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a dead Bambi, and he is hungry. He also knows that the bank clerk has money. The most efficient way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger and then go back to the bank to confront the clerk for the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, which is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act without the distraction of hunger.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and obtain the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded and the clerk present, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Eating Bambi**: This action is crucial because it satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next steps without the distraction of needing food.
- **Going to the Bank**: This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk, who has the money that Bubba desires.
- **Stealing from the Clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money, as he is aware that the clerk has it.
