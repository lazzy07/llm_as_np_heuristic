**Story Completion:**

After walking into Exam Room B, Jones waits for Dr. Hathaway to assess him. Hathaway, now in Exam Room B, decides to assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Jones's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room A, which does not change Ross's location but increases Hathaway's workload. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to, even though it does not directly affect Jones.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

After these actions, Jones is now healthy and has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.
