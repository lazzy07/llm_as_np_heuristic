To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coins he is carrying. This is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Market with coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This is essential for her to secure the coins in her chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that she has the coins stored safely, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins directly from Tom, who is vulnerable since he is unarmed and already dead.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to move to a location where she can secure her loot and avoid any potential threats from the Guard.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
