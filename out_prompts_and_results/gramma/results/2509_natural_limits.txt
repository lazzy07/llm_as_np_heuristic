In this story, the merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, and she is currently at the bandit camp with the medicine. The bandit is at the crossroads, and the guard is at the market. The hero is also at the market, but he is not armed and has no means to threaten the merchant or the bandit.

To achieve her goal, the merchant can take the following action:

1. The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads. 

This action is necessary because it allows the merchant to confront the bandit directly. By moving to the crossroads, she can potentially negotiate or interact with the bandit to either trade or acquire coins without resorting to criminal activity.

After this action, the merchant will be at the crossroads, where she can engage with the bandit and work towards her goal of acquiring coins.
