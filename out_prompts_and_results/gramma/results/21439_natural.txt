The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take action to achieve her goal. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit needs to be at the market to access the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

2. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit retrieves the coins she desires, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins. The first action allows her to reach the location where the coins are stored, and the second action allows her to take possession of them.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.",
    "The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp."
  ]
}
