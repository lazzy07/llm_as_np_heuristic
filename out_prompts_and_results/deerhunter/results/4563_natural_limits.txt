To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba, feeling hungry after shooting Bambi, decides to eat Bambi. He approaches the dead deer and eats it, satisfying his hunger. After eating, Bubba feels more energized and decides to go back to the bank to confront the clerk. He enters the bank and, seeing the clerk with 1 money, Bubba, now emboldened, decides to steal the money from the clerk. With the rifle still in hand, he threatens the clerk and takes the money.

**Explanation of actions:**
1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is a part of his character's needs.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This confirms that Bambi is dead, and Bubba is no longer hungry.
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: This action is required for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead.
