To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also there. Bubba is greedy and hungry, and he has just shot Bambi, which means he has already achieved one of the goals (Bambi is dead). However, he still wants the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba can use his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and the clerk has it.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides a sense of closure to the story.

The final situation will be that Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action is included to show Bubba leaving the scene after successfully stealing the money, providing a narrative conclusion.
