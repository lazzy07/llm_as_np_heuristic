To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on actions that will increase her happiness and wealth. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness can be increased through the acceptance of their relationships. However, since she has the treasure, we can also focus on her wealth.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** (Talia needs to be at the cave to interact with Gargax.)
2. **Talia proposes to Gargax.** (Talia wants to increase her happiness and wealth, and marrying a dragon could provide her with more wealth.)
3. **Gargax accepts Talia's proposal.** (Gargax, wanting to be wealthy, sees the benefit of marrying Talia who has treasure.)
4. **Talia and Gargax get married.** (This marriage increases Talia's happiness and wealth.)
5. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body.** (This action is necessary to ensure Talia becomes wealthy, as Vince is now dead after the marriage.)
6. **Talia's wealth increases.** (Talia now has both the treasure and the money, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Traveling to the cave** is necessary for Talia to propose to Gargax, as she needs to be in the same location.
- **Proposing to Gargax** is a strategic move to increase her happiness and wealth, as marrying a dragon could provide her with more resources.
- **Gargax accepting the proposal** is crucial for Talia's happiness, as it leads to their marriage.
- **Getting married** to Gargax directly increases Talia's happiness and wealth, fulfilling her primary goals.
- **Taking the money from Vince's dead body** is a necessary action to ensure Talia achieves her goal of being wealthy, as she needs to acquire the money.
- **Talia's wealth increases** as a result of her actions, ensuring she meets her goal.
