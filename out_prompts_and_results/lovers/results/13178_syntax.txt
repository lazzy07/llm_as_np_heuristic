To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21). This is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is important for Alex to be in the same room as the other characters to communicate and ensure their happiness.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to themselves (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is a bit redundant since Alex is giving the item to themselves, but it emphasizes that Alex has successfully obtained the item they wanted.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1), which is what they wanted.
