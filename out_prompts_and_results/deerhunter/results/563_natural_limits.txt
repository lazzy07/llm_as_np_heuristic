Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, spots Bambi in the forest. He decides to shoot Bambi to eat and gain some money. Bubba aims the rifle at Bambi and pulls the trigger, killing her. With Bambi dead, Bubba can now eat her and satisfy his hunger. 

After eating, Bubba feels satisfied and decides to take Bambi's body to the bank, where he can potentially sell it or trade it for money. However, since the goal is to ensure Bubba has the money, he can simply take the money from the bank clerk after he has killed Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:
1. Bubba shoots Bambi (Bubba has a loaded rifle and wants to eat).
2. Bubba eats Bambi (satisfies his hunger).
3. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank (to get money).
4. Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk (Bubba is now greedy and wants money).

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while also fulfilling his hunger by eating Bambi.
