To complete the story with the goal of Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to get the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to move to the bank where the clerk is located.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located. Without this action, he cannot interact with the bank clerk or obtain the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint, which directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.
