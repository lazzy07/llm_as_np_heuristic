In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Blake. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to take action.

**Action: Alex tells Blake that Casey wants the flowers.**

**Explanation:** 
- Alex knows that Blake has the flowers and wants to manipulate the situation to get them. By telling Blake that Casey wants the flowers, Alex creates a sense of urgency and misdirection. This may prompt Blake to consider giving the flowers to Casey instead of keeping them for themselves, thus allowing Alex to potentially acquire the flowers.

After this action, the dynamics shift, and Blake, believing that Casey wants the flowers, may decide to give them to Casey, leaving Alex with the opportunity to claim the flowers afterward.
