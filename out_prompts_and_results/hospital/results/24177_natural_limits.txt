Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with steroids.** This action is crucial as it provides the correct treatment for Ross's condition. Since Jarkis is treated with steroids, this will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment, as Dr. Hathaway wants to help all patients.

After these actions, Ross is healthy, and Young is now in the system to be assessed and treated, ensuring Dr. Hathaway is on track to achieve their goal of having all patients healthy.
