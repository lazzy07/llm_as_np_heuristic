3. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)**  
   - Once on the highway, Roy escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising is crucial because it allows Roy to avoid detection by the guards when he attempts to escape. Without the disguise, he would be at risk of being caught.
- The second action of venting to the highway is necessary to physically reach the outside world without being threatened by the bully or guards.
- The final action of escaping is the culmination of Roy's efforts to achieve his goal of being alive and free.
