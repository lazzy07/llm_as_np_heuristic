To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he is hungry. Bambi is also in the forest, and Bubba's greed drives him to want more money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, being greedy and hungry, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger and also ensuring that Bambi is dead.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the kill.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can decide to get more money. This action is included to ensure that Bubba's greed is satisfied, as he may want to find more money after his meal.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi, and he will still be greedy, wanting more money. Bambi will be dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi, making it a logical next step.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action reinforces Bubba's greedy nature and keeps the story aligned with his character's motivations.
