To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle and ammunition. He is also greedy and wants money. Bambi is also in the forest, alive, and poses no immediate threat to Bubba's goals. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either steal or shoot.
   
2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi. This action is taken because Bambi is a deer, and Bubba is hungry. By shooting Bambi, he can eat and satisfy his hunger, while also potentially achieving the goal of having Bambi dead.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This satisfies his hunger and allows him to continue his quest for money without being distracted by hunger.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba then decides to go to the bank. This is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action fulfills his greed and ensures he ends up with the money.

By following this sequence, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead, achieving both goals.
