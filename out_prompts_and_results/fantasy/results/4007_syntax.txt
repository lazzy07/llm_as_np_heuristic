To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since both Rory and Vince have proposed to Talia, she can choose to accept one of their proposals, which will make her happy. Additionally, she can also acquire the treasure in the cave, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases her wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy and wealthy, achieving her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is crucial because it directly addresses Talia's desire for happiness. By accepting Rory's proposal, she gains happiness, which is one of her primary goals.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which contributes to her wealth. Since she is already happy from accepting the proposal, this action ensures she also becomes wealthy.
