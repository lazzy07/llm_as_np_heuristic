In this story, Zoe and the Lizard have just made peace in the cave, establishing a friendly relationship. However, the volcano on the surface is still a looming threat. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have the Lizard take an action that leads to this outcome.

1. **Erupt the volcano**: The Lizard, feeling a sense of urgency to protect the cave and its newfound friendship with Zoe, decides to trigger the eruption of the volcano. This action is taken to demonstrate the Lizard's protective instincts, even if it means sacrificing itself for the greater good.

After the eruption, the Lizard is caught in the lava flow, leading to its demise. Zoe, having made peace with the Lizard, is left safe in the cave but mourns the loss of her new friend.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary action:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard causes the volcano to erupt, which results in its own death.

This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with a character dying and the volcano erupting.
