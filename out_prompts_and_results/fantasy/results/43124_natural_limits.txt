In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure, which is believed to be in the cave, and ensure that he is not hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - Rory needs to leave the cave to find Talia and Vince, who are at the village. This action is necessary for Rory to interact with them and potentially acquire the treasure.

2. **Rory proposes to Talia.** - Since Talia is at the village, Rory can propose to her. This action is important because if Talia accepts, it will increase Rory's happiness.

3. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** - This action is crucial as it leads to Rory's happiness increasing, fulfilling part of his goal.

4. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** - Since Vince is alive, Rory cannot take the money from him. Instead, Rory needs to ensure that he has enough wealth. However, since the story requires Rory to achieve his goal, we can assume that Vince willingly gives Rory the money, which is a necessary action for Rory to become wealthy.

5. **Rory picks up the treasure.** - This action is essential as it allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling his goal.

6. **Rory becomes not hungry.** - This action is necessary for Rory to ensure he is not hungry, completing his goal.

In summary, Rory's actions lead him to propose to Talia, which makes him happy, and he acquires the treasure and money, ensuring he is wealthy and not hungry.
