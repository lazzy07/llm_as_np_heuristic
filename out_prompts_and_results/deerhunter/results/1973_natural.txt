To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba decides to steal.**  
   - Bubba is greedy and wants the money, so he decides to steal it from the clerk.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest to ensure he is away from the bank and the clerk.

5. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - Bubba is hungry and sees Bambi as a potential meal.

6. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can shoot Bambi, fulfilling the condition of Bambi being dead.
