In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to ensure he has both the treasure and the money, as well as maintain his happiness.

After the previous events, Rory is at the village with the treasure, while Vince is at the cave with the money. The simplest way for Rory to achieve his goal is to travel to the cave and take the money from Vince, as Vince is alive and can be robbed of his money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. Rory travels from the village to the cave. (This action is necessary for Rory to reach Vince and take the money.)
2. Rory takes the money from Vince. (This action allows Rory to acquire the money he needs to be wealthy.)

After these actions, Rory will have both the treasure and the money, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy. Since he is already married to Talia, he will also be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel from the village to the cave**: This is essential for Rory to reach Vince and take the money, as he cannot take the money without being at the same location as Vince.
- **Take the money from Vince**: This action directly contributes to Rory's wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
