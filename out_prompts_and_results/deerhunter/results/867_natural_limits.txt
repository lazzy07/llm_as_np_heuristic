Bubba, after shooting Bambi, realizes he is still hungry and wants to have money. He decides to go to the bank to confront the clerk. 

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to get the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his goal of having money.)
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (This action is not strictly necessary for the goal of having money, but it satisfies Bubba's hunger and utilizes the dead animal.)

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money he wanted, and Bambi is confirmed dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money** directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Eating Bambi** satisfies Bubba's hunger, although it is not essential for achieving the primary goal of having money.
