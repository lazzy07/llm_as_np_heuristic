To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba will go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcomes with minimal actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk and take the money.
  
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After acquiring the money, Bubba goes to the forest to eat Bambi. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.
