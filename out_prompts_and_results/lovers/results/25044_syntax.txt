To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the room where Blake is located (R21) to initiate a trade.
2. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action allows Casey to give Blake what he wants while receiving the item they desire.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they want the flowers (I1) and do not have them.
- Blake (C2) is now happy because he has the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to trade items. This action is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake.
- **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: This action allows Casey to exchange the jewelry they have for the chocolates that Blake wants. It directly leads to Casey's happiness by obtaining the item they desire.
