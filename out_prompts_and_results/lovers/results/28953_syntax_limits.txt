In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially obtain the chocolates.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy, which in turn aligns with Casey's own happiness.
