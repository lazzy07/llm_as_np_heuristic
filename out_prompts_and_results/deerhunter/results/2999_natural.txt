To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba looks at the money he has.** (This action is implied as he is already aware of his possession of 1 money.)
2. **Bubba decides to rest in the forest.** (This action is implied as he is not hungry anymore and is content with his current situation.)

**Explanation of actions:**
- The first action is implied as Bubba is aware of his possession of 1 money, which fulfills his goal.
- The second action is implied as Bubba is satisfied and does not need to take any further actions to change his situation.

Since Bubba already has what he wants, no further actions are necessary.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": []
}
``` 

This indicates that no additional actions are needed for Bubba to achieve his goal, as he already has 1 money.
