As the gym echoes with the sounds of weights clanging and the bully's taunts, Roy realizes that he must act quickly to save himself. He knows that the bully is furious about the stolen cigarettes and is likely to take his anger out on him next. 

1. **Roy decides to sneak through the vents to the hallway.** This action is necessary for Roy to escape the immediate threat posed by the bully in the gym.
