After eating Bambi in the forest, Bubba feels a surge of greed for money. He decides to go to the bank to steal from the bank clerk, who is still alive and has some money. 

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba travels from the forest to the bank, motivated by his greed for money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steals the money.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where he can fulfill his greed, and the second action directly results in him acquiring the money he desires.
