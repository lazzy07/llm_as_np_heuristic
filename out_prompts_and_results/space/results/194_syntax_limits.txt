Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both of their safety. The Lizard, currently in the cave, is also aware of the danger posed by the volcano. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the cave and calls out to the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to escape the impending eruption. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it establishes a friendship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave to join the Lizard. This action is necessary to physically bring them together in the same location, reinforcing their new friendship.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, the volcano erupts. This action is the climax of the story, fulfilling the condition that the volcano erupts while the characters are safe in the cave.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since the Lizard is in the cave and Zoe is now safe, the eruption does not kill either character. However, if we were to consider a scenario where the Lizard was still on the surface, this action would signify the danger of the eruption. 

In this case, the story ends with Zoe and the Lizard making peace and becoming friends, while the volcano erupts, but they are safe in the cave.
