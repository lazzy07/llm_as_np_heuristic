To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must first move to the lobby, where they can find the gun. Then, they can move to the office, where the mastermind is likely to be, and finally kill the mastermind using the gun. Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Lobby)**: The secret agent moves from the courtyard to the lobby. This is necessary to access the gun, which is not in the courtyard.

2. **find(SecretAgent, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent finds the gun in the lobby. This action is essential because the secret agent needs the gun to kill the mastermind.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office. This is where the mastermind is likely located, and the agent needs to confront them.

4. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent kills the mastermind using the gun in the office. This is the final action that achieves the goal of the story.

The sequence of actions ensures that the secret agent successfully finds the gun and confronts the mastermind, leading to the desired outcome.
