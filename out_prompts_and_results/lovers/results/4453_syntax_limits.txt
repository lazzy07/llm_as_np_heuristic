In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want the item I3 (flowers), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want the item I2 (chocolates). 

To ensure Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the flowers, making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) remains happy with the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) becomes happy because they now have the flowers (I3).
- Blake (C2) is still unhappy because they still want the chocolates (I2), but Alex's goal of making Casey happy is achieved.

Thus, the story is complete with just one action that fulfills Alex's goal.
