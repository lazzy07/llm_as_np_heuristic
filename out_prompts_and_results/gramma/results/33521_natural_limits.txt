The bandit, realizing that the guard is at the market and the hero is also present, decides to take a calculated risk. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she can confront the hero and the merchant. 

Once at the market, the bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, who is unarmed. She takes the hero's coin from the merchant, successfully adding it to her collection. With this action, the bandit achieves her goal of carrying more coins.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the merchant and the hero, as she needs to be in the same location to execute her plan.
2. **Bandit robs the merchant**: This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The story is short and efficient, with only two actions needed to achieve the bandit's goal.
