To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R12) to the bathroom (R21). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to show Blake's movement in the story.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) from the dining room (R12). This action is also not necessary for Alex's happiness but shows Casey's movement.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
