In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry that Alex is holding. 

To achieve their goal, Casey decides to take action. 

1. **Casey picks up the flowers** from the bathroom. This action is necessary because Casey wants to have an item that makes them happy, and the flowers are currently the only item available in the bathroom.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is still in the bathroom, but now they are holding the jewelry.
- Blake is still in the bathroom, but they are still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the flowers.

Casey has achieved their goal of being happy by picking up the flowers.
