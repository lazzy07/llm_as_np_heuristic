Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Ross again to confirm his symptoms. After confirming that Ross has a fever, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze. With Ross now healthy, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Young receives attention and care, as he is currently unassigned and experiencing unknown symptoms. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot treat him correctly, but admitting him ensures he will receive care in the future.

Through these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.
