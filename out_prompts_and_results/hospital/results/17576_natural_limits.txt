Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, realizes that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions. Since Jones is at Admissions and Young is in Patient Room A, Hathaway decides to first assess Young in Patient Room A.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A and assesses Young. This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment. Since Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway will not make a mistake here because their workload is still manageable (2 after this action).

2. **Treat Young for Flaze**: After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions to Assess Jones**: After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones. This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and can then assess Jones to continue working towards the goal of having all patients healthy.
