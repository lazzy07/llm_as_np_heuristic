To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** - Rory needs to be at the cave to interact with Talia and Gargax, who are both there. This is essential for Rory to achieve his goals.

2. **Rory eats Talia's treasure.** - Since Talia has the treasure, and Rory is hungry, he can eat the treasure to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary for Rory to not be hungry anymore.

3. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** - Since Vince is at the village and has the money, Rory can take the money from Vince's dead body after Vince is dead. This action is crucial for Rory to become wealthy.
