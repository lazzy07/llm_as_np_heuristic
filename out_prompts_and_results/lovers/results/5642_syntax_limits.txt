To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation indicates that I1 is with Casey (C3) in the living room (R21). 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Action: move(C1, R22, R21)** - Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Casey is located. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **Action: give(C3, I1, C1, R21)** - Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This action is essential as it transfers the jewelry from Casey to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
