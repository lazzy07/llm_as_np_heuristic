To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides a narrative closure, showing Bubba moving away from the scene of the crime.

The actions are chosen to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead. In this case, Bambi remains alive, but Bubba successfully acquires the money.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to shoot the bank clerk, eliminating him and allowing Bubba to take the money without any resistance.
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba picks up the money, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.
3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank, possibly to escape or hide after committing the crime.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
