In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The Merchant is currently at the Crossroads, and the Bandit is at the Market, where she can potentially rob the Merchant. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market to be in a position to sell her items and potentially acquire more coins.

This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to return to her preferred location, where she can engage in transactions and maximize her coin collection without resorting to criminal activities.

The story concludes here, as the Merchant has successfully returned to the Market, where she can continue her business.
