Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He points the rifle at the bank clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money he has. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money, but it could be a potential action if Bubba were to become greedy and want more money. However, in this case, he simply takes the money without needing to resort to violence.
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: This action is not necessary for achieving his goal of having money, but it could be a potential action if Bubba wanted to escape or hide after taking the money.
3. **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after acquiring the money.

However, since the goal is to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of having money, the most direct actions would be:

1. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
2. **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger.

Thus, the final story is:

Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, points the rifle at the bank clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money he has. Bubba now has the money he wanted and decides to eat.
