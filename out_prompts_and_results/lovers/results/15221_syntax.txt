To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy because they have the item they want (I3). Blake (C2) currently has the jewelry (I1) but is not happy because they want the chocolates (I2).

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to get an item they want (I2) while giving Alex the opportunity to get the jewelry (I1) later.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey (C3) gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) will have the flowers (I3) and will still be unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C3) will have the chocolates (I2) and will remain happy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade**: This action allows Blake to exchange the jewelry for the flowers, which is a strategic move to help Alex later.
- **give**: This action directly transfers the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
