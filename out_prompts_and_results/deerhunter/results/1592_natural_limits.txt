Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He looks at the bank clerk, who has 1 money. Bubba, with the rifle loaded, becomes greedy and decides to steal the money from the clerk. 

Bubba points the rifle at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, realizing the danger, hands over the 1 money to Bubba. Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not necessary in this case since the clerk willingly hands over the money, but it could have been a potential action if the clerk resisted.

The story is short and direct, with only the essential actions taken to achieve Bubba's goal.
