The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the guard is present. The bandit then reports her own location to the guard, knowing that this will distract him. While the guard is preoccupied with the banditâ€™s report, the bandit quickly returns to the crossroads, where the merchant is still located. 

At the crossroads, the bandit confronts the merchant, who is armed but unaware of the bandit's true intentions. The bandit, wielding her sword, robs the merchant of the medicine. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit now has what she wanted, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
