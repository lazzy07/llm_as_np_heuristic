In this story, Gargax's goal is to become wealthy and not hungry. The simplest way for Gargax to achieve this is to eat one of the humans, which will fulfill both of his needs for wealth (by taking their money) and hunger (by consuming them). 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. Gargax travels from the village to the cave. (This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location where the humans are.)
2. Gargax eats Rory. (This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger and take Rory's wealth, which is 0, but it also eliminates a competitor for the treasure.)
