To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will also need to go back to the bank to get the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and focus on his next goal of acquiring money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is essential as it brings him closer to the bank clerk, who has the money that Bubba desires.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to steal the money from the clerk, as he needs to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba steals the money from the clerk. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and his goal to acquire money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where the money is located.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, removing the obstacle to acquiring the money.
