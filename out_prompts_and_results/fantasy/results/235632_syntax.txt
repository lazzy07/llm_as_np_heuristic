To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which can lead to happiness through marriage.

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village where Rory is located. This is necessary because she needs to interact with Rory to resolve her relationships and achieve happiness.

2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. This action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be with Talia. This is necessary for Rory to be with Talia after their marriage.

4. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is necessary because it removes a potential rival for Talia's affections and wealth, ensuring that Talia can focus on her relationship with Rory without interference.

5. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action increases Talia's wealth, helping her achieve her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will be married to Rory, happy, and wealthy due to the treasure and the money she has acquired.
