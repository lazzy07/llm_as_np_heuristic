To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Blake (C2). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to have an item, which may help in future interactions.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I3). This is the crucial action that allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, which is what they want to be happy.

4. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R21) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

At this point, Casey has the jewelry (I3), which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
