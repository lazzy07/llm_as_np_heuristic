To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk is at the bank with 1 money but is not hungry. 

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This also aligns with his goal of having money, as he can potentially use Bambi's body for food.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** This action is necessary to fulfill the first action's intent. By shooting Bambi, he can then eat her, satisfying his hunger.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, which will satisfy his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** After eating, Bubba can go to the bank to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead.
