**Explanation of Actions:**
- The actions taken by Dr. Hathaway are focused on assessing and treating each patient to ensure they become healthy. By moving between rooms and admitting patients, Hathaway can manage their workload effectively while ensuring that all patients receive the necessary treatment. The choice of treatment (antibiotics) is based on the assumption that all patients have Flaze, which is a reasonable assumption given the context of the story.
