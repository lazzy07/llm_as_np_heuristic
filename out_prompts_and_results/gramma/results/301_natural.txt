**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to rob the guard at the market since the guard is not carrying a sword. 
2. The bandit attacks the guard and successfully kills him, as the guard is unarmed in this scenario.
3. The bandit then loots the guard's corpse, taking the guard's sword and the guard's coin.
4. With the additional coin, the bandit now has more coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **The bandit attacks the guard**: This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate a potential threat (the guard) to ensure her safety and to gain more coins.
2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse**: This action allows the bandit to acquire the guard's sword and coin, increasing her wealth and ensuring she has a weapon for future encounters.
