**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients quickly, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and prescribes antibiotics. 

2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. Since Ross does not have Flaze but is actually healthy, he remains alive and healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Jones and Young.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, assigning him a room for assessment.

5. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and prescribes antibiotics.

6. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. Since Young does not have Flaze but is actually healthy, he remains alive and healthy.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to assess Jones.

8. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B, assigning him a room for assessment.

9. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and prescribes antibiotics.

10. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics. Since Jones does not have Flaze but is actually healthy, he remains alive and healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Ross, Young, and Jones allows Dr. Hathaway to determine their conditions, even if she makes mistakes due to her workload.
- Treating each patient with antibiotics, despite the misdiagnosis, ensures that they remain healthy since they do not have Flaze.
- Walking between rooms is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to manage her patients effectively.
