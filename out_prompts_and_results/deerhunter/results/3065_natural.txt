To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to acquire the money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to be at the bank to steal the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to acquire money, and the clerk has it.
- **Go from the forest to the bank:** Bubba must be at the bank to interact with the clerk and steal the money.
- **Steal the money from the clerk:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will still be dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.
