To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market and head towards the cottage, as he cannot go directly to the cottage from the market.

2. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, where he can carry the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Tom starts at the market after buying the medicine.
- He walks to the crossroads, which is the only path available from the market.
- From the crossroads, he then walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.

The actions are straightforward and necessary to ensure Tom reaches the cottage with the medicine he purchased.
