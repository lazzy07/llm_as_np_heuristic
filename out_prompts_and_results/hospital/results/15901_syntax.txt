To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This is crucial because without assessing, Hathaway cannot know if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Similarly, Hathaway must assess Young to understand their symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

4. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics (if Jones has Flaze) or steroids (if Jones has Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them accordingly. This is also necessary for Young's recovery.

6. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the assessment results. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is necessary to identify the symptoms and determine the correct treatment for each patient.
