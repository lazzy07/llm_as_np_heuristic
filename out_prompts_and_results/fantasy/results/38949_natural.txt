To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and it will lead to Rory's death. Although it seems counterintuitive, Rory's death will allow him to achieve his goal of not being hungry, as he will no longer have hunger. 

2. **Vince takes the money from Rory's dead body**: After Rory is eaten, Vince can take the money from Rory's body. This action is essential for Vince to become wealthy, which indirectly contributes to Rory's goal of wealth since Rory's happiness is tied to the overall wealth of the group.

3. **Gargax takes the treasure**: Gargax, being a dragon, will take the treasure from the cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth, which is a part of the overall wealth dynamic in the story.

4. **Vince travels to the cave**: Vince will travel to the cave to be with Talia and Gargax, ensuring that he is part of the final scene where wealth is distributed.

5. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince will propose to Talia, which is a necessary action to create a bond that can lead to happiness for both characters.

6. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia will accept Vince's proposal, leading to both characters being happy.

7. **Vince and Talia get married**: This final action solidifies the happiness of both characters, ensuring that Rory's goal of happiness is indirectly achieved through the happiness of Talia and Vince.
