To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying the TomCoin. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin from Tom, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the BanditCoin from the chest, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

These actions are necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins. The first action allows her to acquire a coin from Tom, and the subsequent actions ensure she can secure her coins in the Bandit Camp.
