To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - Bubba is greedy and wants the money, so he will attempt to take it from the clerk.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money that the clerk had.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to achieve his goal of having money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle preventing Bubba from taking the money.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the goal of the story is satisfied with Bubba having the money.
