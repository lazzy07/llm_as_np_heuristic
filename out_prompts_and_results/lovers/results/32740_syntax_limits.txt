In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I3 (chocolates), which is currently with Casey (C2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to obtain the chocolates from Casey. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Action: trade(C1, I3, C2, I2, R22)** - Alex suggests a trade to Casey, offering to exchange the chocolates (I3) for the jewelry (I2) that Casey wants. Since Casey wants to be happy and also wants to make Blake happy, they agree to the trade, as it fulfills both their desires.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex now has the chocolates (I3) and is happy.
- Casey has the jewelry (I2) and is also happy.
- Blake remains neutral in this exchange, as their happiness is not directly affected.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (chocolates) while also satisfying Casey's desire for the jewelry. This single action achieves Alex's goal of happiness.
