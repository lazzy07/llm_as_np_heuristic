In the cave, Vince, who has the money, realizes that Talia is at the village and wants to make her happy. He decides to travel to the village to give Talia the money, believing that this will help her achieve her goal of being wealthy. 

1. Vince travels from the cave to the village. (This action is necessary for Vince to reach Talia and give her the money, which will make her wealthy and potentially happy.)

Once Vince arrives at the village, he gives Talia the money. This act fulfills Talia's desire to be wealthy, which in turn makes her happy.

Final situation:
- Talia is alive and now has the money, making her wealthy and happy.
- Rory is alive but remains at the cave.
- Vince is alive and has traveled to the village to help Talia.
- Gargax remains at the cave, with no impact on Talia's happiness or wealth.

Thus, Talia becomes both happy and wealthy.
