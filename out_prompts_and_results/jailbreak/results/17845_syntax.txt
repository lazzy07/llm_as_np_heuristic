**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, Roy is in a precarious situation. He is disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, while Ernest is in the gym with the bully, who is threatening him. To ensure both of them can escape, Roy needs to act quickly.

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Roy, knowing that the bully is in the gym with Ernest, decides to lock the gym door from the hallway. This prevents the bully from leaving and gives Ernest a chance to defend himself without the threat of the bully escaping.

2. **vent(Ernest, Gym)**: With the gym door locked, Ernest can now take action. He uses the knife he has in the kitchen to kill the bully, ensuring that he is no longer a threat to either of them.

3. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: After dealing with the bully, Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes that Roy had stolen earlier. This disguises him and allows him to escape without being recognized.

4. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: With the disguise on, Ernest makes his way to the highway where Roy is waiting. Together, they can escape the prison.
