Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds. After assessing Ross, she mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. She treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect since he actually has Flaze. Ross dies as a result of the incorrect treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to an exam room. She assigns Young to Patient Room A. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. She correctly identifies that Young is experiencing Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is partially achieved, as Young is treated successfully, even though Ross's outcome is tragic. The actions taken are necessary to show the consequences of a high workload and the importance of proper assessment and treatment.
