To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is present in the cave, and Gargax can eat him. This action will also eliminate a potential threat to Gargax, as Rory is another character who desires wealth.

2. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action will increase Gargax's wealth significantly, as treasure is typically more valuable than money.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is no longer hungry after eating Rory, so this action is unnecessary. Instead, we can skip this step.

The final sequence of actions will ensure that Gargax is wealthy (by acquiring the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Rory).

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary actions:

1. Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Rory, who is also in the cave. This satisfies Gargax's hunger.
2. After consuming Rory, Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body, thus increasing his wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)",
    "take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy his hunger, which is one of his goals.
- **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to achieve his goal of becoming wealthy by acquiring the treasure from Rory's body. 

By following this plan, Gargax successfully achieves his goals of being wealthy and not hungry.
