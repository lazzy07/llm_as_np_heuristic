To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is already married to Rory, which means she is happy. However, she is not wealthy, and the treasure is at the cave. Gargax, the dragon, is also at the cave and wants to be wealthy. 

To achieve the goal of making Talia wealthy, we can have the following sequence of actions:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and Gargax wants to eat a human. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money from Vince's dead body.
2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money, which fulfills Gargax's desire to be wealthy.
3. **Gargax gives the treasure to Talia**: Gargax, now wealthy, can choose to give the treasure to Talia, making her wealthy as well.

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia becomes wealthy, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince**: This is a necessary action to eliminate Vince and allow Gargax to take his money.
- **Gargax takes the money from Vince**: This action allows Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth, which indirectly benefits Talia since she will receive the treasure.
- **Gargax gives the treasure to Talia**: This action directly makes Talia wealthy, achieving the goal of the story.
