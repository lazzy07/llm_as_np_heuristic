To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding the symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is also in the admissions room. This will help Hathaway identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young to understand his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated correctly.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics. This will make Jones healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat him with steroids. This will make Ross healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is also diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway should treat him with steroids as well. This will make Young healthy.

Now, let's assume the following symptoms for the sake of this story:
- Jones has a fever (Flaze).
- Ross has a rash (Jarkis).
- Young has a rash (Jarkis).

Here’s the sequence of actions and their explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, fever, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to confirm he has Flaze.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, rash, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to confirm he has Jarkis.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, rash, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to confirm he has Jarkis.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, curing him of Flaze.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, curing him of Jarkis.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, curing him of Jarkis.

After these actions, all patients are healthy, and Hathaway has achieved their goal.
