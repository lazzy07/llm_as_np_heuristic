To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory will travel back to the village to be with Vince and to propose a plan to take the money from Vince.
2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia will also travel back to the village to join Rory and Vince.
3. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory will take the money from Vince, as Vince is in the village and has the money.
4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory will get married, which will make Talia happy.
5. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia will pick up the money that Rory took from Vince, thus achieving her goal of being wealthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Traveling to the Village**: Talia and Rory need to be in the same location as Vince to interact with him and take the money. This is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.
- **Taking Money from Vince**: Rory takes the money from Vince, which is necessary for Talia to become wealthy. This action directly contributes to Talia's goal.
- **Getting Married**: By marrying Rory, Talia achieves happiness, which is one of her primary goals. This action also solidifies their relationship.
- **Picking Up Money**: Finally, Talia picks up the money, ensuring she is wealthy, which is her other goal.
