Bubba is at the bank, feeling hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk.

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to threaten the clerk and steal the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now successfully steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

After these actions, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the ammunition into the rifle** is crucial because it allows Bubba to have the power to intimidate the clerk. Without a loaded gun, he cannot steal the money.
- **Stealing the money from the clerk** is the final action that fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.
