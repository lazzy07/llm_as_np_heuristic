To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the Merchant's sword after killing her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to become armed, which is essential for her to defend herself and potentially rob others in the future.

2. **loot(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the coins from Tom's corpse. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count, helping her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins she looted from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the coins are secured and counts towards her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first arming herself, then looting the coins from Tom, and finally securing them in her camp.
