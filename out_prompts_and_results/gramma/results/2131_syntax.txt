To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Crossroads with a coin.

2. **Take BanditCoin from Chest**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to maximize her coin collection.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, who is unarmed. This action is successful, and the Bandit now has one additional coin.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks to the Bandit camp and takes the coins from the chest. This action allows her to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully increases her coin count through these actions, fulfilling her goal.
