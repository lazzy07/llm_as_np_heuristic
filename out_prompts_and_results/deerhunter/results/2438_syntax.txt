To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to move to a new location where he can potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba will use his rifle to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money he stole from the clerk, and Bambi will be dead, satisfying the requirements of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires, fulfilling his greed.
- **go**: This action allows Bubba to transition to the forest, where he can encounter Bambi.
- **shoot**: This action results in Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the story's conclusion.
