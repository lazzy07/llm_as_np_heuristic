To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk to the Cottage to carry the medicine there, which is his goal.

3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to potentially confront any criminals, including the Bandit.

4. **walk(Bandit, Bandit Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk to the Crossroads, possibly to scout for opportunities to rob or interact with other characters.

5. **report(Merchant, location(Bandit), Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit’s location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is targeted and potentially removed from the scene, allowing the Merchant to operate freely.

6. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Guard will walk to the Bandit Camp to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report.

7. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, eliminating her as a threat and allowing the Merchant to continue her business without fear of robbery.

8. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit’s coins, adding to her wealth without becoming a criminal.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins while avoiding any criminal activity herself. The Bandit is eliminated, and the Merchant benefits from the Bandit's coins.
