In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (I1), but Casey is not happy because they do not have the item they want (I2). Blake can help Casey by giving them the item they want, which is in the same room as Casey.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **give(Blake, I2, Casey, R21)**: Blake gives the item I2 (chocolates) to Casey, who is in the same room (R21). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they wanted.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for happiness, which in turn aligns with Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy. By ensuring that Casey is happy, Blake achieves their own happiness as well.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(Blake, I2, Casey, R21)"]
}
