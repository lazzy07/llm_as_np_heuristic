To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room. This is essential for providing treatment based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Similar to Ross, Young is also in the admissions room. Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room as well, allowing for treatment based on his symptoms.

5. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: Once Ross is in Exam Room B, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young in Exam Room C based on the symptoms identified during his assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young receive the necessary treatment, thus achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
