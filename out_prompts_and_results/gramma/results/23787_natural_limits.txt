The bandit, realizing that the hero is at the crossroads and has no weapon, decides to take advantage of the situation. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is located. The bandit then reports her own location to the guard, misleading him into thinking that she is at the crossroads. This allows the bandit to create a diversion while she secretly returns to the crossroads, where she can safely stash the hero's coin and potentially find her own coin.
