Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway is unaware of his condition. After the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze due to the unknown symptoms. This treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is still experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway is unaware of this. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room B and treats him with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. This treatment is also incorrect, and Young dies.
