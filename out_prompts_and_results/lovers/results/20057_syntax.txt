To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey moves from R21 to R22**: This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry (I2)**: This action is a lie because Alex actually wants the chocolates (I1). However, this misinformation can lead Casey to believe that they need to act to make Alex happy, which is aligned with Casey's goal of making Blake happy.

3. **Casey gives the item they have (I2) to Alex**: Since Casey is now in R22 and believes that Alex wants the jewelry, they will give the jewelry to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Casey's happiness.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates (I1) from Alex**: This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their happiness, as they want to have the chocolates.

5. **Blake gives the chocolates (I1) to Casey**: This action allows Casey to receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). 

Now, Casey is happy because they have received the jewelry, fulfilling their goal.
