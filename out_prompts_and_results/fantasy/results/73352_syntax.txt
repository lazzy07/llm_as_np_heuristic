To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure from the cave while also addressing their hunger. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Vince is in the same location (Village) as Gargax, making him a viable target. This action will also eliminate Vince, allowing Gargax to take the money from him afterward.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This will increase Gargax's wealth.

3. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax will then travel to the cave where the treasure is located.

4. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Finally, Gargax will pick up the treasure in the cave, achieving their goal of being wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- Gargax starts by eating Vince to satisfy their hunger and eliminate a potential competitor for wealth.
- Taking the money from Vince ensures that Gargax has some wealth immediately after satisfying their hunger.
- Traveling to the cave is necessary to reach the treasure.
- Picking up the treasure fulfills Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.
