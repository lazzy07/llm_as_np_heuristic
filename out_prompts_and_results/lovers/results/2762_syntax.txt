To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that are there. This action is necessary because Casey needs to have an item to trade later.

2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to be in the same room as Casey. This is important for the next action where they will trade items.

3. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Alex trades the flowers (I3) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Casey picked up. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to have an item they want, which is the chocolates, and it gives Alex an item to work with.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex again. This is important for the next action where they will work together to achieve their goals.

5. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item that can be used to negotiate or trade for the jewelry.

6. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey again. This is important for the next action.

7. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Casey of their desire, which can lead to a potential trade.

8. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I1). This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the right location to help Alex.

9. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex achieves their goal of being happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, making them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the movement of characters and the exchange of items to ensure Alex can obtain the jewelry.
