To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory's happiness and wealth while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village to be with Vince, who has the Money. This action is necessary for Rory to access the Money, which is essential for his wealth.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the Money from Vince. This action is crucial as it directly increases Rory's wealth, fulfilling one of his primary goals.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia in the Village. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's happiness goal.

At this point, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is happy due to his marriage to Talia, wealthy because he has taken the Money, and he is not hungry since there is no indication of hunger in the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to go to the Village to access the Money held by Vince.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action is necessary for Rory to gain wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
