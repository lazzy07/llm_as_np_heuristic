To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, we need to ensure that he can acquire the medicine from the merchant without being hindered by the bandit. Hereâ€™s the shortest sequence of actions that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market, leaving Tom alone at the crossroads. This is necessary to ensure that Tom can safely approach the merchant without the threat of being robbed or attacked.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom walks to the market to buy the medicine from the merchant. This action is essential as it brings Tom closer to his goal of obtaining the medicine.

3. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using the coin he has. This action is crucial as it allows Tom to acquire the medicine he desires.

4. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom walks back to the crossroads with the medicine. This action is necessary to position Tom closer to the cottage.

5. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action ensures that the bandit is no longer a threat to Tom while he is at the market.

- The third action is the key step where Tom acquires the medicine, which is his primary goal.
