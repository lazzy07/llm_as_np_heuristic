To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is about to erupt, which poses a significant danger to both characters. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship, which will keep her safe from the eruption. After that, she can return to the surface to continue building her friendship with the Lizard.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the impending eruption. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface to continue her efforts to befriend the Lizard. This action is crucial for her goal of making friends.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship. This action is essential for achieving her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Teleporting to the ship** ensures Zoe's safety from the volcano.
- **Teleporting back to the surface** allows Zoe to re-engage with the Lizard.
- **Making peace** establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling her goal.
