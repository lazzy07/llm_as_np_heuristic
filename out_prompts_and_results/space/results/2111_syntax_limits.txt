Zoe, having just teleported to the surface of the planet, realizes that the Lizard is nearby in the cave. Understanding that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and wanting to make friends, Zoe decides to walk to the cave instead of teleporting, which would anger the Lizard. 

As Zoe approaches the cave, she sees the Lizard and decides to make peace. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends. By making peace, they can establish a friendly relationship, ensuring that both Zoe and the Lizard feel secure and connected.
