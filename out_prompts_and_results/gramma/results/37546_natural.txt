To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit loots the hero's corpse.**  
   - The bandit takes the medicine from the hero's body. This action is necessary because the bandit is a criminal and wants to carry as many coins as possible, and the medicine is an item that can be useful for her.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit moves to the camp to store the medicine and any coins she has. This is a strategic move to secure her loot.

3. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant.**  
   - The guard, who is at the market, informs the merchant about the bandit's location. This action is necessary for the merchant to be aware of the bandit's activities and to avoid any potential danger.

4. **The merchant walks from the camp to the market.**  
   - The merchant returns to the market to continue her business and potentially find more coins. This is essential for her goal of acquiring coins.

5. **The merchant buys the medicine from the bandit.**  
   - The merchant uses the hero's coin to buy the medicine from the bandit. This action allows the merchant to acquire an item that can be sold for profit, thus increasing her coin count.

6. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant moves to the crossroads to find more opportunities for trade or to meet other characters who may have coins.

7. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant returns to the market to continue her business and potentially find more coins.

By following this sequence of actions, the merchant successfully acquires coins and avoids becoming a criminal, achieving her goal.
