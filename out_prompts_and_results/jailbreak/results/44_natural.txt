**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to secure his safety and that of his friend Roy. 

1. **Ernest moves to the laundry room.** (He needs to be with Roy to strategize and find a way to escape the bully's threat.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from easily accessing them and gives them a moment to plan.)
3. **Ernest and Roy put on the civilian clothes.** (Disguising themselves will help them avoid detection when they make their escape.)
4. **Ernest and Roy crawl through the vents to the highway.** (This is their escape route, allowing them to leave the prison without being seen.)
5. **Ernest and Roy escape from the prison.** (With the civilian clothes on, they can safely leave the prison and ensure their survival.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Moving to the laundry room:** This action is crucial for Ernest to join Roy and discuss their next steps against the bully.
- **Locking the gym door:** This action is defensive, ensuring the bully cannot reach them while they prepare to escape.
- **Putting on civilian clothes:** This is essential for disguising themselves, allowing them to blend in and avoid being caught by guards.
- **Crawling through the vents to the highway:** This action is a stealthy escape route that keeps them hidden from the bully and guards.
