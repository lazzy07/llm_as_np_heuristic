To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness through their relationship. The next step is to acquire wealth, which can be done by obtaining the treasure located in the cave.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for him to access the treasure and fulfill his goal of becoming wealthy.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for him to be back in the village where he can enjoy his wealth and maintain his happiness.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger status is updated, as he wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry.

5. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave to check on the situation. This action is not directly necessary for Rory's goal but helps to maintain the story's continuity.

6. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to create a consequence for Vince's actions and to ensure that the story remains engaging.

7. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village again, ensuring he is back where he can enjoy his wealth.

8. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry again, reinforcing the need for him to find food.

At this point, Rory has achieved his goal of being happy (through marriage), wealthy (by picking up the treasure), and is now in a position to address his hunger.
