Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway with a pack of cigarettes. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Roy is in the kitchen. To ensure his safety and achieve his goal of being alive and free, Ernest decides to escape the prison.

**Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)**

This action is taken because Ernest is already disguised and is in the hallway, which allows him to leave the prison without being detected. By escaping, he ensures his survival and avoids any further threats from the bully.

**Final Plan:**
