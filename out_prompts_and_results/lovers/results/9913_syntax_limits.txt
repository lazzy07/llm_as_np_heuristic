In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I3 (the item that is currently with Casey). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake achieving their goal:

1. **move(Blake, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve happiness.

2. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R12)**: Blake gives the item I1 (which is currently in the living room) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly helps Alex to be happy by providing them with the item they want (I3) since Blake knows that Alex wants I3 and believes that giving I1 will make Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the item they want, and Blake will also be happy because they have helped Alex achieve their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(Blake, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey to facilitate the next action.
- **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R12)**: This action directly contributes to Blake's goal of making Alex happy, which in turn makes Blake happy.
