To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the items and characters.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room. This is important as Blake needs to be present to facilitate the exchange of items.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the crucial action that directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

4. **move(C1, R11, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to receive the flowers. This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake to accept the flowers.

5. **put_down(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex puts down the flowers in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included to show that Alex is now in possession of the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
