**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, who has just stolen the knife, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he is currently threatened. To ensure his safety and that of his friend Ernest, he moves to the hallway.

1. **go(Roy, Hall)**: Roy moves to the hallway to get closer to the gym where the bully is located. This action is necessary for him to confront the bully without being in the kitchen, where he would be vulnerable.
