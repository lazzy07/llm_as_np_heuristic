Bubba, driven by greed, enters the bank with a rifle and ammunition. He decides to confront the bank clerk to get the money. 

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition to prepare for a potential threat from the clerk. This action is necessary to ensure he has the means to intimidate or harm the clerk if needed.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk, eliminating the only obstacle between him and the money. This action directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of having the money, and the clerk is dead, which also satisfies the condition of Bambi being alive or dead, as Bambi's fate is not directly affected by Bubba's actions in the bank.
