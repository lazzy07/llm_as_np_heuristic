**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, seeing the bandit at the crossroads, decides to report the bandit’s location to the guard at the market. This action is necessary for the merchant to ensure her safety and to avoid any potential robbery or attack from the bandit, as the guard is armed and can deal with the bandit.

2. The guard, upon receiving the report from the merchant, walks from the market to the crossroads to confront the bandit. This action is essential for the guard to fulfill his goal of eliminating criminals.

3. Upon arriving at the crossroads, the guard attacks the bandit with his sword, as the bandit is not armed with a sword. This action is crucial for the guard to achieve his goal of killing the criminal.

4. After the bandit is killed, the guard loots the bandit’s sword from her corpse. This action is not directly related to the merchant's goal but is a logical consequence of the guard's actions.
