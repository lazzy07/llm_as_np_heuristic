To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to give them to Blake.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I2) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the flowers, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) after receiving the flowers. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but helps to keep the characters together.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to give them to Blake.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the flowers, making Blake happy.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room, maintaining the social dynamic.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
