Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to first establish a connection. Since they are not fighting and both are safe and healthy, Zoe can take the following actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action allows Zoe to meet the Lizard in the same location, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - Since they are both safe and healthy, Zoe can initiate a friendly interaction, which is essential for forming a friendship.

After these actions, Zoe and the Lizard will be in the same location and will have established a friendly relationship, achieving Zoe's goal of making friends.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the surface:** This is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.
- **Making peace:** This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is Zoe's primary goal.
