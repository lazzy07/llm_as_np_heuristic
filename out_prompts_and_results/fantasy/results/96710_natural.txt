To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure**: Since the treasure is at the cave and Talia is currently there, she can pick it up. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village**: After picking up the treasure, Talia needs to return to the village where Rory is located. This action is necessary for her to interact with Rory.

3. **Talia gives the treasure to Rory**: Talia can give the treasure to Rory, which will make Rory happy. This action is necessary because Rory's happiness is linked to Talia's happiness, and it also aligns with Talia's goal of being wealthy.

4. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia again**: Since Talia is now wealthy, Rory can propose again, which is a necessary step to ensure Talia's happiness.

5. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal, which will make both of them happy.

6. **Talia and Rory get married**: This final action solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.
