Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway outside the prison. He has successfully stolen a pack of cigarettes from the bully earlier in the day, but he knows he must escape before the bully can retaliate. Since he is already disguised, he can make his move.

**Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)**

This action allows Ernest to leave the prison without being detected, achieving his goal of being alive and free. He has avoided the threat posed by the bully and can now enjoy his pack of cigarettes in peace.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: This is the only action needed for Ernest to achieve his goal. He is already in the right location (the highway) and is disguised, which allows him to leave the prison without being caught by the guards or the bully.
