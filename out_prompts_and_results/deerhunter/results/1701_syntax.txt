To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, and it allows Bubba to take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is repeated to ensure Bubba is in the correct location to pick up the money after shooting the clerk.

The story can be summarized as follows:

- Bubba goes to the bank to confront the clerk.
- He shoots the clerk to eliminate any threat and to take the money.
- He picks up the money from the bank.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Each Action:
1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where the money is located.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money, achieving the goal of having money. 

This sequence effectively leads to the desired outcome with minimal actions.
