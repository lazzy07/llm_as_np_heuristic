To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is greedy and wants to take the clerk's money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Bubba's greed for money.
2. **Go**: After stealing the money, Bubba will go from the bank to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal of acquiring money, but it allows him to leave the scene of the crime and avoid potential consequences.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the clerk and takes the money. This fulfills his greed and achieves his goal of acquiring money.
2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any confrontation or repercussions after stealing the money.

The final story is as follows:

Bubba, having just eaten Bambi, feels a surge of greed. He looks at the bank clerk, who has money. With his rifle loaded, he decides to take action. He steals the money from the clerk, who is too shocked to react. Satisfied, Bubba quickly leaves the bank and heads into the forest, feeling accomplished.
