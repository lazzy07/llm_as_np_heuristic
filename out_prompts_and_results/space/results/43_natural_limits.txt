Zoe stands in the cave, realizing that the surface is erupting and dangerous. She sees the Lizard, who is also safe in the cave. Understanding that they both want to be healthy and safe, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation.

1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to engage with the Lizard and establish a connection.)
2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (This action is crucial for building a friendship, as both characters want to be friends and are not fighting.)
3. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** (This action reinforces the mutual desire for friendship and safety, solidifying their bond.)
4. **Zoe and the Lizard share information about the surface.** (This action helps them understand the dangers of the erupting volcano and strengthens their friendship.)
5. **Zoe invites the Lizard to join her on the spaceship.** (This action ensures both characters can be safe together away from the erupting surface.)
6. **Zoe teleports with the Lizard to the spaceship.** (This action secures their safety and allows them to continue their friendship in a safe environment.)

Through these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making a friend in the Lizard.
