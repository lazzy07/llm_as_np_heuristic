Ernest, realizing he is threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his goal of having a pack of cigarettes. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself against the bully. 

**Action:** Ernest sneaks back through the vent to the laundry room, where he knows Roy is. He informs Roy about the bully's threat and suggests they work together to get the knife from the kitchen.

**Next Action:** Once they are both in the laundry room, they can sneak into the kitchen to retrieve the knife. 

**Final Action:** With the knife in hand, they can then confront the bully in the gym, ensuring they have the means to defend themselves.
