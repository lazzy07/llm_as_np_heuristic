To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave where the treasure is located. The following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with others and potentially secure her happiness.

4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia also marries Vince in the village. This action is included to ensure that Talia's happiness is maximized by having multiple relationships, as both Rory and Vince have proposed to her.
