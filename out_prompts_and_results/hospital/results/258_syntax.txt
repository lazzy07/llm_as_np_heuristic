To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in PatientRoomA, Hathaway should assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway should assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This will help determine Young's symptoms and allow for appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
