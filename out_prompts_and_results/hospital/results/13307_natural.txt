**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess and admit Young to ensure all patients are seen.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. (This allows Hathaway to treat Young, ensuring all patients are assigned to an exam room.)
3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C. (Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine their symptoms.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Unknown. (Hathaway needs to know Young's symptoms to provide appropriate treatment.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. (Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway assumes they might have Jarkis, which is a risk but necessary to try to help Young.)
6. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A. (Hathaway needs to treat Ross, who has a known rash.)
7. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids. (Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the rash, but this is necessary to ensure Ross is treated.)
8. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess Jones.)
9. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown. (Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms.)
10. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics. (Hathaway assumes Jones might have Flaze, which is a risk but necessary to try to help Jones.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated, which is Hathaway's goal.
- Admitting Young to Patient Room C allows Hathaway to manage their workload effectively while ensuring all patients are seen.
- Assessing Young and Jones is crucial to determine their symptoms, even if they are unknown.
- Treating Ross and Jones with the best guess of their conditions is necessary to try to save them, despite the risk of misdiagnosis due to Hathaway's workload.
