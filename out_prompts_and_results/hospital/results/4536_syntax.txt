To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently there. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to and to help Ross as well.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is important to provide the correct treatment for Ross.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Ross also has a chance to become healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: This action is taken to identify Jones's symptoms.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: This action is taken to treat Jones based on the identified symptoms.
3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: This action is taken to move Hathaway to the admissions room to see Ross.
4. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), Admissions)**: This action is taken to identify Ross's symptoms.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), Admissions)**: This action is taken to treat Ross based on the identified symptoms.

By following these actions, Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
