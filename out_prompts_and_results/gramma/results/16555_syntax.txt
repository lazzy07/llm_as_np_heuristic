To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can safely leave the market and return to the cottage without being hindered by the guard or the merchant. Since the bandit is already dead, Tom can focus on his goal without worrying about the bandit.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the market and needs to leave to head towards the crossroads, which is the only path available to him to reach the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom can now walk to the cottage, which is his final destination.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine he purchased.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market, where he is currently located, and move towards the crossroads, which is the only path leading to the cottage.
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to reach his ultimate goal of being at the cottage.
