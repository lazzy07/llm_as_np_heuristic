Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both recognize the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface and decide to work together to ensure their safety. Zoe suggests that they should teleport back to the spaceship to avoid the eruption, but the Lizard, feeling a sense of duty as the guardian of the surface, insists on staying to protect the cave and its surroundings.

Zoe understands the Lizard's commitment and decides to stay with the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship. As they talk, the ground begins to tremble, and the volcano erupts, sending lava flows toward the cave.
