**Story Completion:**

As the tension in the gym escalates, Ernest and Roy realize they need to act quickly to avoid the bully's threats. 

1. **Ernest decides to sneak out of the gym and head to the kitchen to retrieve the knife.** This action is necessary because the knife is the only means to defend themselves against the bully. 

2. **Roy, sensing the danger, follows Ernest but stays hidden in the hallway.** This allows him to avoid direct confrontation with the bully while still being close to help Ernest if needed.

3. **Ernest reaches the kitchen and successfully steals the knife.** This is crucial for their survival, as it gives them a chance to fight back against the bully.

4. **Ernest returns to the gym, where the bully is still present.** He knows he must confront the bully to ensure both his and Roy's safety.

5. **Ernest locks the gym door behind him, preventing the bully from escaping.** This action is strategic, as it traps the bully inside with him, ensuring that they can deal with the threat without interference.

6. **With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully.** This is the moment of truth where he must either defend himself or succumb to the bully's threats.

7. **In a desperate struggle, Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** This action allows Ernest to overcome the immediate threat, ensuring his and Roy's survival.

8. **After the confrontation, Ernest and Roy quickly put on the civilian clothes they had stolen earlier.** This disguises them and prepares them for their escape.

9. **Finally, they crawl through the vents to the highway, where they can escape from the prison.** This is the culmination of their efforts to survive and avoid further threats.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to either defend against the bully or facilitate an escape. The initial decision to retrieve the knife is critical for self-defense. Locking the gym door ensures that the bully cannot escape and retaliate. Killing the bully is the only way to eliminate the threat, and putting on civilian clothes is necessary for their escape. Crawling through the vents is the final step to freedom.
