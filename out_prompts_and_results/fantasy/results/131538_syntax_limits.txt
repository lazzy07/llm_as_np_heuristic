In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. To achieve this, Gargax will take the following action:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax will eat Talia, who is currently in the Village. This action serves two purposes: it eliminates a character who could potentially interfere with Gargax's goals, and it satisfies Gargax's hunger. After eating Talia, Gargax will have access to her wealth, which is currently zero, but it also allows Gargax to remain in the Village where the money is located.

After this action, Gargax will be satisfied in terms of hunger, and while Talia's wealth is zero, Gargax can still pursue the treasure in the cave later.

### Explanation of the Action:
- Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Eating Talia achieves this goal.
- By eating Talia, Gargax also removes a character who could potentially pose a threat to his plans for wealth.
