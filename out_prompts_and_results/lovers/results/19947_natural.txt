To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey can help Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex to achieve their goal, but it allows Casey to move to a different location, potentially to look for the chocolates later.

3. **Blake moves to the living room.**  
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but allows Blake to be in the same room as Alex, which could facilitate future interactions.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but helps Blake achieve their own happiness by obtaining the chocolates.

5. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but allows Blake to help Casey achieve happiness, as Casey wants the jewelry.

The story concludes with Alex being happy because they have received the flowers from Casey.
