To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (the flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R22). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the item they have (I2, the chocolates) to Alex. This action is important because it allows Alex to receive an item, which may help them in their quest for happiness.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to be in a position to help Alex and Casey. This is necessary for Blake to facilitate the next steps.

4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Blake and to potentially receive the item they want.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to finally receive the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.

6. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be in a different location, ensuring that they are not in the way of Alex and Blake.

At this point, Alex has received the flowers, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
