To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is already in PatientRoomA with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for him.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the confirmed symptoms. If Ross has Flaze (fever), he will be treated with antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis (rash), he will be treated with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to see Jones and Young, who are currently waiting there. This is necessary to assess their conditions.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is important to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him accordingly. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.
