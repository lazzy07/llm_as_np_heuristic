To ensure Blake achieves their goal of obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (Casey believes the chocolates are in the bathroom and wants to find them.)
2. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.** (Casey finds the chocolates and now has the item they want.)
3. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Casey returns to the living room with the chocolates.)
4. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.** (Casey wants Blake to be happy and gives them the chocolates.)

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Casey moves to the bathroom**: This action is necessary because Casey believes the chocolates are there and needs to retrieve them to achieve their own happiness and help Blake.
- **Casey picks up the chocolates**: This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is essential for the next steps.
- **Casey moves back to the living room**: This action is needed to bring the chocolates back to the group where Blake is, facilitating the next action.
- **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake**: This final action ensures that Blake receives the chocolates, making Blake happy and fulfilling their goal.

After these actions, the final situation is:
- Alex has the flowers and is happy.
- Blake has the chocolates and is happy.
- Casey has the jewelry and is happy.

All characters are now happy, and Blake has achieved their goal.
