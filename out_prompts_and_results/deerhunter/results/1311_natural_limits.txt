Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, decides to take action. He points the rifle at the bank clerk, who is startled but remains calm. Bubba demands the clerk's money. The clerk, realizing the situation, hands over the money to Bubba without resistance. Satisfied, Bubba now has the money he wanted.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: This action is not necessary for achieving the goal of obtaining money, so it is excluded.
