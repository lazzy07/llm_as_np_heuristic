To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just shot Bambi, and is hungry. He also knows that the bank clerk has money. The most logical course of action for Bubba is to go back to the bank and steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary to get to the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba is at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba is still hungry. He decides to eat, which is a natural response to his hunger.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to access the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to steal money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger and decides to eat.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger.
