Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano nearby rumbles ominously, and Zoe knows they need to find safety. 

To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe suggests they teleport back to the spaceship together. The Lizard, understanding the urgency, agrees. They both teleport to the spaceship, leaving the dangerous surface behind.

This action is crucial because it allows both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy and safe. By teleporting together, they reinforce their friendship and ensure they are no longer in danger from the erupting volcano.
