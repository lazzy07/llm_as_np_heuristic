To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the bank clerk. He is hungry and has a greed for money. The bank clerk is also greedy but is currently alive. Bambi, the deer, is alive in the forest.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential threat to Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but can be included to show Bubba's movement after acquiring the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money and the bank clerk being dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is a barrier to him obtaining the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his greed by acquiring the money after the clerk has been dealt with.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is included to show Bubba's movement after achieving his goal, although it does not directly affect the outcome.
