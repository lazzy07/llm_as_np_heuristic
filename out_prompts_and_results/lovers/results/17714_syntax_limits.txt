In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the flowers (I1), while Casey wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I3). Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. 

Given the current situation, the following action will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R21)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex (C1) wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus making them happy.
