To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to leave the market and head to the cottage. Since he is currently at the market and has the medicine, he can simply walk to the cottage.

Here’s the complete story:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the market to the cottage, successfully reaching his desired location while carrying the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. No other actions are needed since Tom already possesses the medicine and simply needs to move to the cottage.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
