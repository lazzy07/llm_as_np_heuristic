To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Since Zoe is in the cave and the Lizard is on the surface, she can initiate a peaceful interaction. This action is crucial because it allows both characters to stop any potential conflict and work towards friendship, which is a mutual goal.

2. **Zoe walks to the surface**: After making peace, Zoe can walk to the surface where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for them to be in the same location to further their relationship.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard discuss their goals**: They can share their desires for health, safety, and friendship, which helps to strengthen their bond and ensures that both characters feel secure in their relationship.

5. **Zoe teleports back to the ship**: After establishing a friendship and discussing their goals, Zoe can teleport back to the ship. This action is safe for her and does not anger the Lizard since they are now friends.
