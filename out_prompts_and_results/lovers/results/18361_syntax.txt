To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not yet in anyone's possession, and we need to facilitate the exchange of items to achieve this.

Here's the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) to be closer to Alex and Blake, where the action is happening.
   - This action is necessary to bring Casey into the same room as Alex and Blake, allowing for potential item exchanges.

2. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the chocolates (I2), which is a lie since Casey actually wants the jewelry (I3).
   - This action is intended to mislead Blake into thinking that Casey wants the chocolates, which may prompt Blake to act in a way that helps Casey.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bathroom (R12) to retrieve the chocolates (I2) that they believe Casey wants.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to get the item they think will make Casey happy, which may lead to a trade or exchange.

4. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom.
   - This action is essential for Blake to have the item they believe will make Casey happy.

5. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the dining room (R22) with the chocolates.
   - This action brings Blake back to the room where Casey is, allowing for the next interaction.

6. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey.
   - This action is crucial as it allows Casey to receive the item they were misled into wanting, which may lead to a positive outcome.

7. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R21) with the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to leave the dining room after receiving the chocolates.

8. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the living room (R21) to check on Casey and Blake.
   - This action allows Alex to be present with both characters, facilitating further interactions.

9. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R21)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) they have for the jewelry (I3) with Alex.
   - This action is essential for Blake to achieve their goal, as it allows Alex to give the jewelry to Blake.

10. **give(C1, I3, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake.
    - This final action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, making them happy.

At the end of these actions, Blake has the jewelry (I2), which fulfills their desire to be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the movement of items and characters in a way that ultimately leads to Blake receiving the jewelry.
- The misleading information from Casey helps to create a scenario where Blake believes they are helping Casey, which leads to the necessary exchanges.
