To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Ross without reducing their workload. However, we need to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will make him healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the symptoms identified for Young, Hathaway will treat him accordingly. If Young has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, making him healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones for Flaze with antibiotics, as he has a fever.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to make Ross healthy based on the assessment.
3. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment.
4. **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to make Young healthy based on the assessment.
5. **Treat Jones**: This action is necessary to make Jones healthy based on his symptoms.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that all patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms, leading to their health and well-being.
