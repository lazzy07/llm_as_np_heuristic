Tom, the hero, stands at the crossroads with the merchant, who has the medicine. The bandit, armed and dangerous, is at the market, eyeing the merchant's coin. The guard is also at the market, ready to deal with any criminals.

To achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the merchant decides to take a calculated risk. She quickly hands the medicine to Tom, who is eager to return to the cottage. In exchange, Tom gives the merchant his coin, which she can now keep without any criminal implications.
