To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that Rory has, which will fulfill Gargax's desire for wealth. 

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that Rory had. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth.

3. **Gargax becomes hungry**: Gargax's hunger will increase after eating Rory, but since Gargax does not care about being happy, this action is not detrimental to Gargax's goals.

4. **Gargax travels to the cave**: Gargax can then travel to the cave, where they can rest and enjoy their newfound wealth.

5. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince wants to be happy and not hungry. By proposing to Talia, he can achieve happiness through marriage.

6. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which makes both of them happy.

7. **Vince and Talia get married**: This final action solidifies their happiness, fulfilling Vince's goal.
