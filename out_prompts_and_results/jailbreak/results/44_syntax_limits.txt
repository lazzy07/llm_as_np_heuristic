**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that Ernest has stolen the bully's pack of cigarettes, which has made both of them targets. To protect himself and his friend, Roy quickly moves to the kitchen to grab the knife. 

Once he has the knife, he heads to the gym where the bully is currently spending his recreation time. Roy knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest, so he takes a deep breath and confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy returns to the laundry room to help Ernest. They both put on the civilian clothes, disguising themselves. Finally, they make their way to the highway, where they escape from the prison together, free at last.
