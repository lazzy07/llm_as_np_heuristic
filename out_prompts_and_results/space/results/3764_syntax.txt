To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship for safety.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is taken to solidify their friendship. Since they are not fighting, this action will help them become friends, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe can safely teleport back to the spaceship. This action is necessary to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **make_peace**: This action is crucial because it aligns with Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard. By establishing a friendship, both characters can feel safe and healthy together, which is a mutual goal.
  
- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe's safety. The surface is dangerous due to the volcano, and by teleporting back to the spaceship, Zoe ensures her health and safety.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions allows Zoe to achieve her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
