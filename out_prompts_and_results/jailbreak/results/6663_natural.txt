**Story Completion:**

Ernest, knowing he is threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards when he attempts to escape.

Next, Ernest moves from the highway back to the hallway. This is necessary because he needs to be in a position to escape the prison. Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door. This action prevents the bully from following him and ensures that he cannot be threatened while he makes his escape.

Finally, Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway. Once he reaches the highway, he is now in a position to escape the prison. Since he is wearing the civilian clothes, he can successfully leave without being recognized as a prisoner.

By taking these actions, Ernest achieves his goal of being alive and free, while also avoiding any threats from the bully.
