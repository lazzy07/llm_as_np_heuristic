To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first reduce the workload by treating one of the patients correctly, which will allow Hathaway to assess the remaining patients without the risk of error.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will assume that Ross has a fever (symptom of Flaze) and Hathaway correctly identifies it.
   
2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Ross healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload to 2.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room A. With the workload now at 2, Hathaway can accurately assess Young's symptoms.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: Assuming Young has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Young healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload to 1.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Jones in the Admissions room. With the workload at 1, Hathaway can accurately assess Jones's symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Assuming Jones has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, making Jones healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
