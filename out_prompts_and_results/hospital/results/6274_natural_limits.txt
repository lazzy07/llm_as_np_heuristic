Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, decides to admit Young to Patient Room A to reduce her workload and ensure all patients are seen. She then walks back to Patient Room B, where Ross is located. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to manage her workload effectively.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is currently in Patient Room B.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Ross has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment with antibiotics, allowing him to become healthy.)

After these actions, Ross is treated correctly and achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
