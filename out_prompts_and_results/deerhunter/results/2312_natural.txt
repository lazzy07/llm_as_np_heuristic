To achieve Bubba's goal of having 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** (Bubba already wants to have money, so this action is necessary to clarify his intent.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money to achieve his goal.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Deciding to get money** is a necessary action to establish Bubba's intent, even though he already has 1 money. This action is included for clarity.
- **Shooting the clerk** is essential because it allows Bubba to take the clerk's money. Since the clerk has 0 money, this action is not directly beneficial, but it is necessary for the narrative to progress.
- **Picking up the money from the clerk** is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
