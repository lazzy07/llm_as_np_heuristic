To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the treasure that Rory has. Since Talia is married to Rory, she can benefit from the treasure he possesses. The simplest way to ensure Talia's happiness is to have Rory give the treasure to Talia, which will make her happy. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** (Rory needs to go to the cave to be near Gargax, who is a potential threat.)
2. **Gargax eats Rory.** (This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, and Rory has the treasure that Gargax desires.)
3. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body.** (Gargax now has the treasure, which he desires.)
4. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.** (Gargax wants to go to the village where Talia and Vince are.)
5. **Gargax proposes to Talia.** (Gargax wants to ensure he can keep the treasure safe and Talia is a means to that end.)
6. **Talia accepts Gargax's proposal.** (This action is necessary for Talia to become happy, as she is now in a relationship with a powerful dragon.)
7. **Gargax and Talia get married.** (This solidifies Talia's happiness as she is now married to a dragon who has wealth.)
8. **Gargax gives the treasure to Talia.** (This action directly makes Talia wealthy, fulfilling her desire for wealth.)

Now, Talia is both happy and wealthy due to her marriage to Gargax and receiving the treasure.
