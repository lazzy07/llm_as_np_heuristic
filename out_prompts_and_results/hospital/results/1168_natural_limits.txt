**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, after assessing Young in Patient Room A and observing the rash, realizes that Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, they are still able to treat Young without making a mistake. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. Young responds positively to the treatment and becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting there. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** This action is necessary because Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates Jarkis. Treating with the correct medication ensures Young's health and fulfills their goal of being alive and healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room.** This action is included to show that Dr. Hathaway is moving to help another patient, Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This action does not directly affect Young's goal but is part of the continuity of the story.
