The bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the hero is dead and the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, the bandit can take advantage of the situation to achieve her goal. 

Here’s the shortest story where the bandit achieves her goal:

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the merchant.
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the merchant and attempt to take the medicine or any coins she might have.

2. The bandit attacks the merchant.
   - The bandit is armed and can attack the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to eliminate the merchant and take her items.

3. The bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant.
   - After defeating the merchant, the bandit can take the medicine, which is an item she can use or sell later.

4. The bandit walks from the crossroads back to the bandit camp.
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may have taken.

5. The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.
   - This action ensures that the bandit has the medicine secured in her camp, achieving her goal of having valuable items.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
