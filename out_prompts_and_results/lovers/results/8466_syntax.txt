To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that I1 is in the same room as Alex (R22), but Alex is not happy yet. This indicates that Alex needs to take action to acquire the jewelry.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because Alex needs to have the item they want to be happy.

2. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included to show that Alex is considering the dynamics of the room and the other characters.

3. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2) in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which is also part of Alex's goal.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R22). This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, which is the jewelry.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R21). This action is included to show Casey's movement after receiving the jewelry.

6. **put_down(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I1) in the bathroom (R21). This action is included to show that Casey is now in a different room with the item.

7. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R21) to check on Casey.

8. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the bathroom (R21). This action is necessary for Alex to have the item they want.

9. **happy(C1) = True**: At this point, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
