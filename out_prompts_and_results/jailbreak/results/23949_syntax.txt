**Story Completion:**

As day one comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, stands on the highway outside the prison. He knows that he has to escape before the guards or the bully can catch him. Meanwhile, Ernest remains in the cell block, feeling threatened by the bully, who is currently in the gym.

Roy takes a deep breath, glances back at the prison, and then makes his move. He walks confidently down the highway, knowing that he has successfully disguised himself and can blend in with the outside world. 

With each step, he feels the weight of the cigarettes in his pocket, a small comfort that reminds him of his friendship with Ernest. He knows that he has to leave the prison behind for both of their sakes.
