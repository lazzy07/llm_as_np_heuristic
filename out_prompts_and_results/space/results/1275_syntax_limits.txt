Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they share a mutual desire to be healthy and safe while also wanting to make friends. 

To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, which is a safe location. Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, they have just established a friendship, and the Lizard understands Zoe's need for safety. 

Zoe teleports to the spaceship, leaving the Lizard on the surface. The Lizard, now alone, feels a sense of relief knowing that Zoe is safe, and they can continue to build their friendship from a distance. 

This action allows the Lizard to achieve their goal of being healthy and safe, as they remain on the surface but are no longer in immediate danger due to the volcano's potential eruption.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, which indirectly supports the Lizard's goal of being healthy and safe as well. By teleporting, Zoe avoids the danger of the erupting volcano, and the Lizard understands that this is a necessary action for Zoe's well-being.
