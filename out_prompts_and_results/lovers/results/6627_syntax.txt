To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3)**: This action is necessary for Alex to understand what Casey desires, as Alex currently believes that Casey wants the chocolates (I2). By telling Alex the truth, Casey can align their desires.

2. **Alex picks up the jewelry (I3) from the bedroom (C1)**: Since the jewelry is in the bedroom and Alex is currently in the dining room, they need to move to the bedroom to pick it up.

3. **Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the bedroom (R22)**: This action allows Alex to access the jewelry.

4. **Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey**: This action directly fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.

5. **Casey is now happy**: Since Casey has received the jewelry, they achieve their goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey tells Alex they want the jewelry.
2. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the bedroom to get the jewelry.
3. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry.
4. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.

Now, let's present the final plan in JSON format:
