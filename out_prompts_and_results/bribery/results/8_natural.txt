**Story Completion:**

The villain, having successfully bribed the President with the stolen money, now has control over him. The villain wants to ensure that the money is used to further their own agenda, which involves getting Unknown to have the money.

1. The villain coerces the President into wanting Unknown to have the money. The villain uses their control over the President to manipulate him into believing that giving the money to Unknown is the best course of action. This action is necessary because it aligns the President's desires with the villain's goal.

2. The President, now coerced by the villain, gives the money to Unknown. This action is the culmination of the villain's manipulation, as it directly results in Unknown receiving the money, fulfilling the villain's goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The villain coerces the President to ensure that the President's will aligns with the villain's goal. This is crucial because the President has the money, and without this coercion, the villain cannot achieve their objective.
- The President gives the money to Unknown as a direct result of the villain's coercion, which is the final step in achieving the villain's goal of getting Unknown to have the money.
