The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is located. The bandit reports the location of the bandit to the guard, misleading him into thinking that the bandit is at the crossroads. This action creates a diversion, allowing the bandit to return to the crossroads unnoticed. 

Once back at the crossroads, the bandit confronts the merchant. Since the merchant is armed but believes the bandit is still at the crossroads, she is caught off guard. The bandit then robs the merchant, taking the medicine. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit returns to her camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary to create a diversion by reporting her own location to the guard.
2. **Bandit reports the location of the bandit to the guard**: This misleads the guard, allowing the bandit to return to the crossroads without being pursued.
3. **Bandit walks back to the crossroads**: This action is essential for the bandit to confront the merchant and take the medicine.
4. **Bandit robs the merchant**: This is the key action that allows the bandit to achieve her goal of obtaining the medicine.
