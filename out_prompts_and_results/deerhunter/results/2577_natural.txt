To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the power to take action against the clerk or Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, which will result in the clerk being dead and Bubba being able to take the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and the story concludes with the desired outcome.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to reach the clerk and take action to get the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** directly leads to the clerk's death, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
- **Picking up the money** ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.
