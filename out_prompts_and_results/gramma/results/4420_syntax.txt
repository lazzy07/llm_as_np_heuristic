To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant buys the medicine from the Merchant**: The Merchant is already at the Camp with the medicine. She can buy it from herself, which allows her to gain the medicine without any criminal activity. This action is necessary for her to increase her inventory and potentially sell it later for more coins.

2. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads**: After acquiring the medicine, the Merchant will walk to the Crossroads. This is a strategic move to position herself closer to the market and the potential for more transactions.

3. **Merchant walks to the Market**: The Merchant will then walk to the Market, where she can engage with other characters and potentially sell the medicine or trade for more coins.

4. **Merchant buys a sword from the Guard**: Once at the Market, the Merchant can buy a sword from the Guard using one of her coins. This action is crucial as it allows her to defend herself and gives her the ability to rob or defend against any potential threats.

5. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads**: With the sword in hand, the Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads, where she can assess the situation and decide her next move.

6. **Merchant robs the Bandit**: The Merchant will then rob the Bandit, who is at the Crossroads and is not armed. This action allows the Merchant to take one of the Bandit's coins, increasing her total without becoming a criminal.

7. **Merchant walks to the Camp**: Finally, the Merchant will walk back to the Camp, where she can safely store her coins and the medicine, ensuring her goal of maximizing her coin collection is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Buying the medicine**: This is a legal transaction that increases the Merchant's inventory.
- **Walking to the Crossroads and then to the Market**: These movements are necessary to position herself for further transactions.
