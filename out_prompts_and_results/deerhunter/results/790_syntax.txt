To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he is greedy for money. The bank clerk is still alive in the bank with one unit of money. Bambi is also in the forest, alive and not directly involved in the money situation.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either threaten or shoot someone.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank. He needs to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and Bambi remains alive, which is acceptable as the goal is achieved with Bubba having the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba needs to load the rifle to be able to shoot the clerk.
