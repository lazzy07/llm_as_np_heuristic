To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial because both characters want to be friends, and establishing a peaceful relationship will help them achieve their individual goals of safety and friendship.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk back to the cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to return to a safe location where it can feel secure and away from potential dangers on the surface.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action is important as it allows Zoe to stay close to the Lizard and continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once both characters are in the cave, Zoe will also make peace with the Lizard again. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in their new environment.

By following these actions, the Lizard successfully achieves its goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
