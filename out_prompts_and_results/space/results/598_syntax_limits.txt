Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both their safety. She walks to the cave where the Lizard is located, hoping to communicate and establish a friendship. 

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to find the Lizard. This action is necessary for her to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, as they are currently in different locations.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Upon reaching the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for achieving their mutual goal of safety and friendship, as it allows them to stop any potential conflict and work together.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action fulfills the requirement of the story to have the volcano erupt, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully establishes a friendship with the Lizard, ensuring their safety in the face of the erupting volcano, which ultimately leads to the Lizard's demise as they are unable to escape the eruption.
