In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Casey decides to take action. 

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the bathroom.** This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and it is currently in the bathroom where they are located. By picking it up, Casey can now have the item they desire, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows: 
- Alex is still in the bathroom but remains unhappy because they do not have the flowers.
- Blake is still in the bathroom but remains unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
