To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to have the flowers in order to give them to Alex, which is what Alex wants.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to be present in the same room as Alex and Casey, but it does not directly affect Alex's goal.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to achieve their own goal of happiness, but it is not necessary for Alex's goal.

5. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to receive the chocolates, which fulfills Casey's desire and makes them happy, but again, it does not directly affect Alex's goal.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, while Casey and Blake also achieve their goals.
