To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had just bought. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to go to the chest at the camp, which is currently not accessible.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that she has the coins she desires, completing her objective.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: This action allows the Bandit to gain coins without engaging in a more dangerous confrontation with the Guard or Tom, who is already dead. It is a strategic move to increase her wealth.
  
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: This action is essential for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her newly acquired coins. The Bandit Camp is her preferred location.

- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action finalizes the Bandit's goal of having coins in her possession, either on her or in the chest, thus achieving her objective.
