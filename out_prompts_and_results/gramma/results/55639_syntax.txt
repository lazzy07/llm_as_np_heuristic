To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can leave the market without being stopped by the guard. Since Tom is currently a criminal after attacking the merchant, the guard will be suspicious of him. However, since the merchant is dead, the guard will not have any immediate reason to pursue Tom.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will allow Tom to achieve his goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom leaves the market and heads to the crossroads. This action is necessary for him to move towards the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom continues from the crossroads to the cottage. This action is essential for him to reach his desired location.

Now, Tom is at the cottage carrying the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to exit the market where he is currently located. Since the guard is present, it is crucial for Tom to leave before the guard can take any action against him.
  
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to reach his final destination, the cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine.
