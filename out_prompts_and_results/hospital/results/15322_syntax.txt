To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reasons as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure Young also becomes healthy.
