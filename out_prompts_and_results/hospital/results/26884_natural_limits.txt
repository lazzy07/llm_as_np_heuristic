Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis (the rash) instead of Flaze (the fever). 

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Ross dies as a result of the wrong treatment.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room A, where he can be assessed and treated later. 

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's actions are focused on assessing and treating the patients, even though a mistake leads to a tragic outcome for Ross. The goal of ensuring that patients are assessed and treated is partially achieved, as Young is now in a position to be treated correctly later.
