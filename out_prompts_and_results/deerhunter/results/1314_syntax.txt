To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank to confront the bank clerk.
   - **Explanation**: Bubba is greedy and wants money, so he needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle.
   - **Explanation**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money, fulfilling his greed.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat the dead Bambi.
   - **Explanation**: Although Bambi is already dead, this action shows Bubba's hunger and allows him to utilize the resources available to him.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi in the forest.
   - **Explanation**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and completes the story by ensuring that Bambi is dead and Bubba has taken advantage of the situation.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money from the bank clerk and will have eaten Bambi, ensuring both conditions are met.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "decide_to_eat(Bubba)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba achieving his goals of obtaining money and ensuring Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
