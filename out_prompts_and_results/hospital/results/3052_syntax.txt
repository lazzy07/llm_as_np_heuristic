To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first reduce the workload by treating one patient correctly, which will allow Hathaway to assess the remaining patients without the risk of error.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment is required.
2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is found to have Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This will reduce Hathaway's workload by one and ensure Young becomes healthy.
3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms.
4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is found to have Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This will further reduce Hathaway's workload and ensure Ross becomes healthy.
5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is found to have Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

This sequence ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat each patient without the risk of making a mistake due to high workload.
