To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I3) that Alex picked up. This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry to be happy, and Alex is currently holding it.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: After the trade, Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but sets up the next action for Alex.

3. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the same room (R22). This action is crucial as it allows Casey to finally obtain the item they want.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
