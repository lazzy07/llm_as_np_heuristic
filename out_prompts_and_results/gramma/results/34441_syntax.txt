To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the camp, so she will walk to the crossroads to interact with the merchant and Tom.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob the merchant, taking the coin that Tom bought from her. This action is possible because the merchant is unarmed and the bandit is armed.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk back to the camp, where she can store the coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit will take the coins she just acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to successfully achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary for the bandit to reach the crossroads where the merchant and Tom are located.
- The second action allows the bandit to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as she is already a criminal and the merchant is unarmed.
- The third action is required for the bandit to return to her camp after acquiring the coins.
- The final action ensures that the bandit successfully places the coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal.
