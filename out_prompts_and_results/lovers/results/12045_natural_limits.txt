**Story Completion:**

1. **Casey picks up the flowers.** (Casey is in the bathroom with the flowers, so they can easily pick them up.)
2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.** (Casey wants to make Alex happy, and since Alex wants the flowers, this action directly helps Alex achieve their goal.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Casey picks up the flowers:** This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey is the only character who currently has them. By picking them up, Casey is preparing to fulfill Alex's desire.
  
- **Casey gives the flowers to Alex:** This action is crucial as it directly satisfies Alex's goal of being happy. By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey not only helps Alex achieve happiness but also fulfills their own desire to make Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, while Casey is also happy because they have helped Alex. Blake remains unhappy because they still do not have the chocolates, but the story focuses on Alex achieving their goal.
