To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action takes him directly to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **Tom's Goal**: Tom wants to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. By walking directly to the cottage, he achieves both parts of his goal: reaching the cottage and having the medicine with him.

No other actions are needed because Tom already has the medicine, and there are no threats or obstacles in this scenario that would require additional actions.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads Tom to his goal in the simplest manner possible.
