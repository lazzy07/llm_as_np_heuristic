The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the crossroads. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is carrying a sword, the bandit decides to take a risk. She approaches the hero and, with a swift motion, she robs the hero of the merchant's sword. Now armed with two swords, the bandit feels more confident. 

Next, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her newly acquired sword and her own coins in the chest. With the hero distracted and the guard still at the market, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

2. **Walk to the bandit camp**: The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp to store her coins and the newly acquired sword, ensuring her safety and fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.
