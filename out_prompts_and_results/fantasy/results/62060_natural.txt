To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to Rory, who has money but no treasure. The treasure is located in the cave, and Gargax, who is hungry, is also in the village. 

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to eat. By eating Rory, Gargax will also take the money that Rory has, which will help Talia in the next steps.
   
2. **Gargax takes the money from Rory.** - After eating Rory, Gargax will have the money Rory had. This action is implied as Gargax consumes Rory, and since Rory is dead, Gargax can take the money.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave.** - Gargax will go to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for Gargax to access the treasure.

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure.** - Gargax will take the treasure from the cave. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy.

5. **Gargax returns to the village.** - Gargax will come back to the village with the treasure, which is important for the next action.

6. **Gargax gives Talia the treasure.** - Gargax, now wealthy, can choose to give the treasure to Talia. This action will make Talia wealthy.

7. **Talia becomes happy.** - With the treasure, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy, which in turn makes her happy.

By following these actions, Talia will end up wealthy and happy, fulfilling her desires.
