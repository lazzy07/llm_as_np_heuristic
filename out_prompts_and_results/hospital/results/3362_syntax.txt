To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and admit Young, who is currently in the Admissions room. This action is not directly related to Jones's goal but is necessary for the overall hospital operation.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for Young's treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Young also has a chance to become healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken to achieve Jones's goal:

1. Assess Jones to determine his symptoms.
2. Treat Jones based on the assessment to ensure he becomes healthy.
3. Walk to Admissions to manage other patients.
4. Admit Young to Exam Room C for further assessment.
5. Assess Young to determine his symptoms.
6. Treat Young based on the assessment to ensure he also becomes healthy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy while also addressing the needs of other patients in the hospital.
