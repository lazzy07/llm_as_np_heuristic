Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she spots the Lizard nearby. Both are aware of the dangers surrounding them, but Zoe is determined to make a friend out of the Lizard. She approaches the Lizard and decides to make peace.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is chosen because Zoe's goal is to make friends with the Lizard, and since they are not currently fighting, this is the perfect opportunity to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, Zoe ensures both she and the Lizard can feel safe and healthy together on the planet.

After this action, Zoe and the Lizard become friends, achieving her goal of making a connection with another creature.
