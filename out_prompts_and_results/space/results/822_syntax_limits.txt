In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment dangerous. They have already established a friendly relationship, but Zoe is still in a precarious situation due to the erupting volcano.

To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die while ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard remain friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a hazardous environment on the surface. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of the volcano erupting and leads to the potential for a character to die.

2. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, may feel compelled to protect the surface and inadvertently causes Zoe's demise during the eruption. This action is necessary to ensure that one character dies, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

After these actions, the story concludes with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard remains safe. Despite the tragic outcome, the relationship between Zoe and the Lizard remains friendly, as they had made peace earlier.
