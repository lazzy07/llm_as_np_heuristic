In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is in the same room as Blake), and Blake has item I1 (which Alex has already given to Casey). To achieve their goal, Blake can give item I1 to Alex, which will make Alex happy. Since Alex is happy, Blake will also be happy.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, which is the item that will make Alex happy. Since Alex is now happy, Blake also achieves their goal of being happy.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- happy(Blake) = True
- happy(Alex) = True
- happy(Casey) = False (but Casey's happiness is not Blake's concern).

Thus, Blake achieves their goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

  "plan": ["give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)"]
