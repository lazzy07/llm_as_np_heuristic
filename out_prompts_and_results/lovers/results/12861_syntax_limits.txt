However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want I3 (flowers), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want I2 (chocolates). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want (I3 - flowers).

- Alex (C1) is still happy because they have I1 (jewelry).
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have I3 (flowers).
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy because they still want I2 (chocolates).

This single action allows Alex to achieve their goal of making Casey happy.
