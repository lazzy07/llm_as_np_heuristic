**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Ernest is in the kitchen with the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. Roy decides to take action to ensure both of their safety. 

Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where the bully is currently spending his recreation time. Once inside the gym, Roy locks the door to prevent the bully from escaping. With the bully trapped, Roy takes out the knife he stole from the kitchen and confronts the bully. In a moment of desperation and self-defense, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to the hallway and put on the civilian clothes he knows are in the laundry room. Once disguised, he can escape from the prison.
