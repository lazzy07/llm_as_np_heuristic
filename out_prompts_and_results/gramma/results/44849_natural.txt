To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit loots the merchant's corpse to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to ensure that the medicine is not left behind and can be used or sold later.
2. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the bandit to return to her preferred location and secure her coins in the chest.

The story unfolds as follows:

- After attacking the guard and the merchant, the bandit loots the merchant's corpse, taking the medicine. This action allows the bandit to gain an item of value.
- The bandit then walks from the market to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins secured.

The final outcome is that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "loot the merchant's corpse",
    "walk from the market to the bandit camp"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is directly related to the bandit's goal of maximizing her coin collection and ensuring her safety by returning to her camp.
