Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He points the rifle at the bank clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money to Bubba. With the money in hand, Bubba leaves the bank, satisfied with his gain.

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not necessary for the goal since Bubba can achieve his goal without killing the clerk. Instead, he can simply demand the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
3. **Bubba goes to the forest**: This action is not necessary for the goal since Bubba can achieve his goal without going to the forest.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba points the rifle at the clerk and demands the money.
2. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money to Bubba.
3. Bubba leaves the bank with the money.
