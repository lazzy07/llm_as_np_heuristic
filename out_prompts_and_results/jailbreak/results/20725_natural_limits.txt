**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realizes that he has the upper hand. He knows that the bully believes he is safe in the gym, but with the knife in his possession, he can turn the tables. 

Roy takes a deep breath and, with determination, he lunges at the bully with the knife. The bully, caught off guard, tries to defend himself, but Roy is fueled by the need to protect himself and Ernest. In a swift motion, Roy manages to stab the bully, killing him instantly. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he needs to escape before anyone finds out what happened. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself.
