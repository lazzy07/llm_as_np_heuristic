**Story Completion:**

After walking back to PatientRoomA, Ross is feeling anxious about his health. He knows he needs to be assessed by Dr. Hathaway to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA. Since Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway correctly identifies the disease.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. Ross becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms and correctly identify the disease he has. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot provide the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Ross's recovery. By administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze), Hathaway ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
