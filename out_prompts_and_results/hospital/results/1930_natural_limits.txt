Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing a fever, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, which successfully makes Jones healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. Ross walks from Admissions to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B and finds that he is also experiencing a fever. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 2, so he correctly identifies Ross's condition as Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, making Ross healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. Young walks from Admissions to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and finds that Young is experiencing a rash. With a workload of 3, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze instead of Jarkis and treats him with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

The story ends with both Jones and Ross becoming healthy, while Young dies due to the misdiagnosis.
