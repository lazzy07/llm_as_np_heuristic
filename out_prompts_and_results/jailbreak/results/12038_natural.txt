**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway and realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Roy is still in the cells and is in danger from the bully. To ensure both of their safety, he decides to act quickly.

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for him to access the gym and potentially help Roy.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, he prevents the bully from leaving and ensures that he cannot threaten Roy while Ernest figures out a plan.)
3. **Ernest sneaks through the vents back to the cells.** (This action allows him to reach Roy without being seen by the bully.)
4. **Ernest tells Roy to put on the civilian clothes.** (This is crucial for Roy to disguise himself and escape with Ernest.)
5. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (Now both are disguised and can escape together.)
6. **Ernest and Roy move to the highway.** (This final action allows them to escape the prison together.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that both Ernest and Roy can escape safely without being threatened by the bully. Locking the gym door is a strategic move to neutralize the bully's threat while they prepare to leave. Sneaking through the vents allows for stealth, and putting on civilian clothes is essential for their disguise to avoid detection.
