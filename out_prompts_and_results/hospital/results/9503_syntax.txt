To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they will mistakenly believe Jones has the same symptoms as Young (SymptomB). This is necessary to determine the treatment for Jones.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, believing that Jones has Flaze due to the mistaken assessment. This action is crucial because it will either save Jones or lead to their demise, but it is necessary to attempt to treat all patients.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway will then assess Ross, who is also in Admissions. This will allow Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross with steroids**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids, assuming Ross has Jarkis. This is necessary to ensure Ross's health.

5. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young again to confirm their symptoms and ensure they are treated correctly.

6. **Treat Young with steroids**: Since Young has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated, and the goal of making them healthy is achieved.
