In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but they are both unhappy and lack wealth. Vince, who is at the village with the money, is also unhappy. Gargax, the dragon, is at the cave and desires wealth. 

To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is taken because Gargax wants to eliminate a competitor for the treasure, which is at the cave. By eating Rory, Gargax can then take the treasure for himself, which will make him wealthy. However, this action inadvertently leads to Rory's demise, which is a necessary sacrifice for the story to progress towards the goal of wealth.

After this action, Rory is dead, and Gargax can now take the treasure, fulfilling his desire for wealth. Rory's goal of being happy and wealthy is ultimately unachievable due to the circumstances, but the story ends with Gargax achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Gargax eats Rory: This action is necessary to remove Rory from the competition for the treasure, allowing Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth.
