**Story Completion:**

Ernest, knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, decides to take a risk. He moves to the gym door and locks it behind him, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. 

Next, he confronts the bully, who is unaware of the locked door. With the knife in hand, Ernest takes a deep breath and attacks the bully, killing him. This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Roy.

Afterward, Ernest quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can escape from the prison.
