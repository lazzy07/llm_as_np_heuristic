Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and strengthen their friendship.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave.** - This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, where they can discuss their friendship and safety without the immediate threat of the volcano.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they are together in a safe space where they can continue to build their friendship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and commitment to each other's safety and well-being.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to stay in the cave until the volcano calms down.** - This action is implied as they choose to remain in a safe location, ensuring both characters are healthy and safe from the dangers of the surface.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.
