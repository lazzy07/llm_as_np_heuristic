2. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross and finding that he has a rash, Hathaway treats him with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Rash, Admissions**: Hathaway then assesses Young in the Admissions room to check for symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young is also treated appropriately.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Steroids, Admissions**: After assessing Young and finding a rash, Hathaway treats him with steroids as well, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to assess Ross to determine his condition. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot know how to treat him.
- The second action treats Ross correctly, ensuring he recovers from Jarkis.
- The third action assesses Young to identify his symptoms, which is necessary for proper treatment.
