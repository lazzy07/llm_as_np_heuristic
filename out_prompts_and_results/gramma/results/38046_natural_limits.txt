Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads, determined to return to the cottage with the medicine. He knows that the bandit is at the market, and he needs to act quickly to avoid any confrontation. 

Tom decides to report the location of the bandit to the guard, who is also at the market. By doing this, he ensures that the guard will take action against the bandit, allowing him to safely make his way back to the cottage without the threat of being robbed again.
