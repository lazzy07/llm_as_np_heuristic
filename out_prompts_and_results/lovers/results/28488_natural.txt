To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are wanted.** (Blake needs to communicate to Casey that they want the chocolates, which will help Casey understand Blake's desire.)
2. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (Casey believes the chocolates are in the bathroom and will go to check.)
3. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.** (Casey finds the chocolates, fulfilling their belief that they are in the bathroom.)
4. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Casey returns to the living room with the chocolates.)
5. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.** (This action allows Blake to receive the chocolates, making Blake happy.)

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the living room and is still not happy because they still want the flowers.
- Blake is now happy because they have the chocolates.
- Casey is still happy because they have the jewelry.

The actions are necessary to achieve Blake's goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates, while also maintaining the existing beliefs of the characters.
