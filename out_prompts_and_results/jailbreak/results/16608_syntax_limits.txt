1. **Go to the Kitchen**: Ernest moves to the kitchen to retrieve the knife. This is necessary because he needs a means to defend himself and potentially confront the bully if necessary.

2. **Steal the Knife**: Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen. This action is crucial as it gives him a weapon to protect himself and Roy from the bully.

3. **Go to the Hall**: Ernest returns to the hallway with the knife. This allows him to be in a position to either confront the bully or prepare for an escape.

5. **Revenge on the Bully**: Once in the gym, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully. This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Roy, ensuring their safety.

6. **Disguise**: After dealing with the bully, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. This is essential for his escape plan.
