To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank to get the money.
   - **Explanation**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is located.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will use his rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money.
   - **Explanation**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, achieving the goal of the story.
