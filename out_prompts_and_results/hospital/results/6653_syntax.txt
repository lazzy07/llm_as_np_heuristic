To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reasons as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. This is crucial for Young's recovery.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones also receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. This is the final step to ensure all patients are healthy.
