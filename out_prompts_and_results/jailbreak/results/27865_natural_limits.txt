Roy, realizing the danger he and Ernest are in due to the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows he has the knife and the cigarettes, and he is in the gym with the bully. To ensure their safety and to achieve his goal of having a pack of cigarettes, he makes a bold move.

**Action:** Roy kills the bully with the knife.

This action is necessary because it eliminates the immediate threat posed by the bully, allowing Roy and Ernest to be safe. With the bully dead, Roy can keep the pack of cigarettes without fear of retaliation.

After killing the bully, Roy can now return to the kitchen where Ernest is, and they can discuss their next steps without the looming threat of the bully.
