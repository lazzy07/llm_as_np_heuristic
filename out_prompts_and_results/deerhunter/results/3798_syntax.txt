To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal of acquiring money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary to reach the location where the bank clerk is, as he needs to confront the clerk to achieve his goal of getting money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money, and since he has a loaded gun, he can successfully steal from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have satisfied his hunger and achieved his goal of acquiring money.
