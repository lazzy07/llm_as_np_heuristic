To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and is greedy for money. The bank clerk also has money, which makes him a target for Bubba's greed. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving one of the specified endings.
