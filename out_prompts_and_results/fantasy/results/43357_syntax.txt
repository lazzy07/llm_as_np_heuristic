To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. Since Talia is already married to Rory, she has achieved happiness. The next step is for her to acquire wealth. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Vince has the money, and since he does not care about being rich, he can willingly give it to Talia. This action allows Talia to acquire the money she desires.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village to ensure she is in a safe place to enjoy her newfound wealth.

3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave, which adds to her wealth.

Now, Talia has both the money and the treasure, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to gain wealth. Vince's indifference to wealth allows him to give the money to Talia.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: This action is to ensure Talia is in a safe location after acquiring wealth.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, further increasing her wealth.
