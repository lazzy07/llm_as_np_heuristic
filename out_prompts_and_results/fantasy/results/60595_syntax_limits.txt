In the current situation, Talia is married to Rory, and both are happy. However, Talia is not wealthy, and her goal is to become wealthy. The only way for Talia to achieve wealth is to acquire the money that Vince had before he was killed by Gargax. Since Gargax is now in the village and is hungry, he will likely want to eat Talia or Rory next. 

To ensure Talia becomes wealthy, the best action is for Talia to take the money from Vince's dead body. This action will make Talia wealthy, fulfilling her goal.
