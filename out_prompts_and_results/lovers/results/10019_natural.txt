To achieve Blake's goal of obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the bathroom.**  
   - This action is necessary because it misleads Alex into thinking that the chocolates are nearby, which may prompt Alex to act in a way that helps Blake.

2. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to be in the living room to interact with Casey, who has the flowers and is currently unaware of Blake's intentions.

3. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers.**  
   - This action is intended to create a sense of urgency for Casey to give the flowers to Alex, which will distract her from her own desires and allow Blake to negotiate for the chocolates.

4. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Casey moves to the bathroom to check on Alex, believing that Alex wants the flowers, thus leaving the living room empty.

5. **Blake picks up the chocolates from the living room.**  
   - With Casey distracted in the bathroom, Blake can now take the chocolates without interference.

6. **Blake is now happy.**  
   - Blake has achieved their goal of obtaining the chocolates.
