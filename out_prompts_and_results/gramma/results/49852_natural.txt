**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market. (The bandit wants to be at the market to potentially rob the merchant or find a way to acquire coins.)
2. The bandit approaches the merchant and robs her, taking the hero's coin. (The bandit is armed and can rob the merchant since the merchant is not armed.)
3. The bandit walks back to the crossroads carrying the hero's coin. (The bandit wants to return to the crossroads with the stolen coin.)
4. The bandit places the coin in the chest at the bandit camp. (The bandit wants to ensure the coin is secured in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary for the bandit to reach a location where she can interact with the merchant and potentially acquire coins.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the bandit to successfully steal the hero's coin from the merchant, which directly contributes to her goal of having coins.
- The third action is needed for the bandit to return to a safe location (the crossroads) after committing the robbery.
- The final action secures the stolen coin in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling the bandit's goal of having coins in her possession.
