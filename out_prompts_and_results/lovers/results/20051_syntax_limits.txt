In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. Currently, Casey is unhappy because they do not have the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

To achieve their goal, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry from Blake. Since Blake is currently in the same room as Alex (R22) and has the jewelry, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Casey can trade the item they have (which is the chocolates, I2) with Blake for the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they want, thus making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the complete action:

- **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R22)**: This action allows Casey to give the chocolates to Blake in exchange for the jewelry.
