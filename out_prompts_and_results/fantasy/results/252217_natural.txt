To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince has, which will also help Rory in the long run since it will eliminate a competitor for Talia's affections.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth.

3. **Rory travels from the village to the cave**: Rory needs to be at the cave to be with Talia and to ensure that he can claim the treasure he has.

4. **Rory proposes to Talia**: Since Talia is now free (Vince is dead), Rory can propose to her again, which is necessary for him to achieve happiness.

5. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: This action is essential for both Rory and Talia to be happy together.

6. **Rory and Talia get married**: This final action solidifies Rory's happiness and fulfills his goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Gargax eats Vince (to eliminate a competitor and gain wealth).
2. Gargax takes the money from Vince's body (to achieve wealth).
3. Rory travels from the village to the cave (to be with Talia).
4. Rory proposes to Talia (to achieve happiness).
5. Talia accepts Rory's proposal (to achieve happiness).
6. Rory and Talia get married (to solidify happiness).
