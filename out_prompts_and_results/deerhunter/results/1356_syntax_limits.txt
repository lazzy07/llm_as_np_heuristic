To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk because he is greedy and wants the money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can kill the clerk and take the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Although this action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal, it can be included to show Bubba leaving the bank after obtaining the money.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome of Bubba having the money. The action of shooting the clerk is essential as it allows Bubba to take the money, and picking up the money is the final step to ensure he possesses it.
