To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and wants to get money, while the clerk has 1 money. Bubba is also hungry, which may influence his actions.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to either threaten the clerk or to shoot Bambi later.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba now has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi, as she is currently in the forest.

4. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the possible endings.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Load ammunition into the rifle:** Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **Steal money from the clerk:** Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Go to the forest:** Moves Bubba to Bambi's location to confront her.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** Fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba has the money and Bambi is dead.
