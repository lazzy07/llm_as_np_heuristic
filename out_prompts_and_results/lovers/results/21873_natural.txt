To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to retrieve the flowers that are currently in the living room.

2. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the flowers, which is what Alex wants.

3. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - Casey needs to return to the dining room to give the flowers to Alex.

4. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the dining room.**  
   - This action fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is not happy because they still want the jewelry.

This sequence of actions is the shortest way to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
