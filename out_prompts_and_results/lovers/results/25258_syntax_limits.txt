In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (flowers), and Casey is happy because they have the item they want (jewelry). However, Blake is not happy because they do not have the item they want (chocolates).

To achieve their goal, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want (chocolates) while also ensuring that Casey remains happy with the jewelry.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex remains happy with the flowers.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry.
- Blake becomes happy because they now have the chocolates.

This single action allows Blake to achieve their goal of happiness while also ensuring that Alex and Casey are still happy.
