Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He knows he needs to get back to the cottage, but the guard is also at the crossroads, and he is wary of the bandit who is at the camp. 

To achieve his goal of reaching the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is strategic because it not only helps the guard fulfill his duty of eliminating criminals but also creates a distraction that allows Tom to safely make his way back to the cottage without encountering the bandit.

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is necessary because it ensures the guard will focus on the bandit, allowing Tom to leave the crossroads without fear of being attacked or robbed.

After reporting, the guard, now aware of the bandit's presence, rushes towards the bandit camp to confront the bandit. Meanwhile, Tom takes this opportunity to walk back to the cottage.

2. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** This action is the final step that allows Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine.

With these two actions, Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his objective.
