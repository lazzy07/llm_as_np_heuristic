**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, noticing that Young is in PatientRoomC, decides to assess Young's symptoms first. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomC to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Young is healthy and does not show any symptoms. 

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing, Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, mistakenly believing Young has Jarkis. However, since Young is healthy, this treatment does not harm them and reduces Hathaway's workload by one.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the Admissions room to assess and treat Jones, who is still waiting. 

In this scenario, Hathaway successfully reduces their workload and ensures that Young remains healthy, achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and ensure they receive appropriate treatment.
- **Treat Young**: Although Hathaway mistakenly treats Young for Jarkis, the treatment does not harm Young, and it reduces Hathaway's workload, allowing them to manage their responsibilities better.
- **Walk to Admissions**: This action is essential for Hathaway to reach Jones and continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.
