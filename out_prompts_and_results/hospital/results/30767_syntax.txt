To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young's symptoms are currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Jones's symptoms are also unknown, and Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross in PatientRoomA. Since Ross has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment based on the symptoms (assuming SymptomB corresponds to Jarkis). This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
