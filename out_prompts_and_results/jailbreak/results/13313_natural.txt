**Story Completion:**

Day one continues with Ernest on the highway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows he needs to escape before the bully finds out he has stolen the cigarettes. 

1. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** 
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free. Since he is already on the highway and wearing civilian clothes, he can successfully escape without being detected.

Meanwhile, Roy is still in the cells, unaware of Ernest's escape. He is still threatened by the bully, who is in the gym. 

2. **Roy does his chores in the laundry room.**
   - This action is necessary for Roy to avoid the bully's wrath and to stay alive. Completing his chores may also help him gain favor with the guards, reducing the chances of being targeted by the bully.

At this point, Ernest has successfully escaped, and Roy is safe for now, having completed his chores.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's escape is the primary action that allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and free. The disguise is crucial for this action, as it prevents the guards and the bully from recognizing him.
- Roy's action of doing chores is a defensive move to ensure he remains safe from the bully's threats, allowing him to survive another day in prison.
