To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. Bambi is also present in the forest, and Bubba has a loaded rifle, which gives him the ability to shoot.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This also eliminates Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
   
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action directly fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead. 

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially take the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead.
