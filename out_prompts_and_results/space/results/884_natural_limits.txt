Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous and that the Lizard is in peril, decides to take action to help the Lizard. She teleports from the cave to the surface to warn the Lizard about the erupting volcano and to offer her friendship.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface:** This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the surface to communicate with the Lizard and ensure its safety. By teleporting, she can quickly reach the Lizard and help it understand the danger it is in. This action also opens the opportunity for them to become friends, as they are no longer in conflict.

After Zoe teleports to the surface, she finds the Lizard and explains the situation. The Lizard, grateful for Zoe's concern, agrees to become friends, achieving both of their goals of safety and friendship.
