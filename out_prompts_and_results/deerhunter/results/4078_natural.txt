To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the bank and the clerk has 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money. Since the clerk has 1 money, shooting him will allow Bubba to take it without any further resistance.

2. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, which fulfills his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Shoot the clerk** - This action removes the clerk as a threat and allows Bubba to take the money.
2. **Pick up the money** - This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal in the shortest possible way while adhering to the constraints of the story.
