To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is in the bank and has a rifle and ammunition. He needs to load the rifle to be able to use it effectively. This action is necessary for him to threaten the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After loading the rifle, Bubba can shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Bubba, driven by greed, decides to get money and heads to the bank with a rifle and ammunition he picked up from his house.
- Once at the bank, he loads the rifle to prepare for a confrontation.
- He then shoots the bank clerk, eliminating the threat and allowing him to take the money.
- Finally, Bubba picks up the money, achieving his goal.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
