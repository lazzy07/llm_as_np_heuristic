To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C. This is important to identify Young's symptoms as well, ensuring that both patients are treated appropriately.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently waiting there. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide treatment.

6. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring that he also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
