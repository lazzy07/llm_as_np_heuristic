**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Action: admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room A, where Young is already assigned. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen.

2. **Action: assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Young is the only patient in this room, Hathaway can determine if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). 

3. **Action: treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has Flaze, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This treatment is correct, and Young becomes healthy.

4. **Action: assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway then assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones is now the only patient in this room, Hathaway can determine his symptoms.

5. **Action: treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Jones also has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

At this point, both Young and Jones are healthy, and Hathaway has successfully achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
