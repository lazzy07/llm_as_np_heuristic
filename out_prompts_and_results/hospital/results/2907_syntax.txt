To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first reduce the workload by treating one patient correctly, which will allow Hathaway to assess the remaining patients without the risk of error.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment is required.
2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This will ensure Young becomes healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload by one.
3. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.
4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (a fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.
5. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms.
6. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

This sequence ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat each patient without the risk of making a mistake due to high workload.
