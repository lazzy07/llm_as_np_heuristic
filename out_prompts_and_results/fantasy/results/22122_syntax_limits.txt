To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince, who is currently at the same location (Cave). This action allows Talia to become wealthy, as she now possesses the money that Vince had.

This action is necessary because Talia's goal is to be wealthy, and since she has no money at the moment, taking it from Vince is the quickest way to achieve that. 

After this action, Talia will have money, which contributes to her wealth, and since she is already in a relationship with Rory (who has accepted her proposal), she will also be happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)"]
}
``` 

In summary, the story is completed with a single action that allows Talia to achieve her goal of being both happy and wealthy.
