To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory is currently in the cave. He needs to travel to the village to be with Talia, who has accepted his proposal. This is essential for Rory's happiness, as he wants to be with Talia.

2. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Once Rory arrives in the village, he can pick up the money that is currently with Vince's dead body. This will increase Rory's wealth, which is one of his goals.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: After picking up the money, Rory can marry Talia since she has accepted his proposal. This will make both of them happy, fulfilling Rory's happiness goal.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: To ensure Rory is not hungry, he can become hungry after the marriage, but since he has achieved his other goals, this action is more of a formality in this context.

The sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goals of happiness and wealth while also addressing his hunger indirectly.
