In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry), which is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to obtain the jewelry. 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the item they have (I3 - flowers) with Casey for the item they want (I1 - jewelry). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to get the jewelry they desire while also ensuring Casey is happy with the flowers.

The action sequence is as follows:

- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers they have for the jewelry that Casey has. After this trade, Alex will have the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex has I1)
- happy(C2) = False (Casey still does not have what they want)
- happy(C3) = False (Blake still does not have what they want)

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire through a trade with Casey.
