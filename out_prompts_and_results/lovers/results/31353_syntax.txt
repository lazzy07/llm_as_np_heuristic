To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the dining room (R21) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey has it in the dining room (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and obtain the jewelry.
   
2. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I3) they picked up earlier for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey and facilitate the trade.
- **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to exchange the flowers for the jewelry, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy. 

With these two actions, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
