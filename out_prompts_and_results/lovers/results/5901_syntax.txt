To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R22) where the flowers are located. This is necessary for Alex to access the flowers.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the bathroom. This is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the bathroom (R22) to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for potential interactions with Casey and Blake.

4. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21). This is to ensure that Alex is in a position to interact with the other characters if needed.

5. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the bathroom (R22) to ensure they are in the right place with the flowers.

6. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) to interact with Casey and Blake.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters can still pursue their happiness, but Alex's goal is achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)"
