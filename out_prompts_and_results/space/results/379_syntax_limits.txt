Zoe, safe aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface of the planet is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She knows that the Lizard, who is currently in the cave, is unaware of the imminent danger. To ensure both their safety and to foster a friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to the surface to warn the Lizard.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to warn the Lizard about the volcano. This action is necessary because she needs to communicate the danger directly to the Lizard.

Once on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and quickly explains the situation. The Lizard, initially wary of Zoe's sudden appearance, listens to her and realizes the threat they both face.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to put aside any previous misunderstandings and work together to escape the danger. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of their goals.

As they begin to move towards safety, the volcano erupts violently, catching them off guard.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, and unfortunately, the eruption is too powerful for either character to escape in time. This action leads to the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

In the end, although Zoe dies in the eruption, she and the Lizard have made peace and established a friendship in their final moments, achieving their goals of safety and connection.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting back to the surface** is essential for Zoe to warn the Lizard about the volcano.
- **Making peace** is necessary to ensure that they can work together and establish a friendship before the eruption.
- **The eruption** serves as the climax of the story, resulting in the death of Zoe while also highlighting the bond formed between her and the Lizard.
