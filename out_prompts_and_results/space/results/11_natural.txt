Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, decides to confront Zoe by teleporting to the surface. 

Once on the surface, the Lizard and Zoe are in the same location, and the Lizard attempts to stun Zoe to prevent her from leaving again. Zoe, however, manages to break free from the stun. In the heat of the moment, they both realize that they are not enemies but rather two beings trying to survive and understand each other. 

Instead of continuing the fight, Zoe suggests they work together to find a safe place away from the volcano. The Lizard, seeing Zoe's genuine intention, agrees, and they both walk towards the cave, where they can be safe from the eruption. 

As they reach the cave, they share their stories and realize they have similar goals of health, safety, and friendship. They decide to make peace, thus becoming friends. 

However, just as they settle in the cave, the volcano erupts violently, causing destruction on the surface. Fortunately, both Zoe and the Lizard are safe inside the cave, but the eruption signifies the danger of the surface.
