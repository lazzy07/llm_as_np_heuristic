To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's greed and his desire for money.

Here’s the action that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to take the money from the bank clerk.

This action is necessary because Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to go to the bank to obtain the money. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Bubba will be at the bank, and since he is greedy, he will take the money from the bank clerk.

Now, let's summarize the story:

1. Bubba, having just shot Bambi, is hungry and greedy. He decides to go to the bank to get money.
2. He moves from the forest to the bank, where the bank clerk is present.

At this point, Bubba will have the opportunity to take the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba will end up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
