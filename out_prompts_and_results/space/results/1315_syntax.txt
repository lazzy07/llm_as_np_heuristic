Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are currently safe but aware that the surface is dangerous. To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, Zoe reinforces this by expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial for establishing a strong bond and ensuring both characters feel secure.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface with Zoe, indicating a willingness to explore the planet together. This action shows their growing friendship and commitment to each other's safety.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard notice signs of a volcano beginning to erupt. This action is a critical turning point, as it creates urgency for them to act quickly to ensure their safety.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe quickly walks back to the spaceship to escape the impending eruption. This action is necessary for her safety, as the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous.

6. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the spaceship, demonstrating their newfound friendship and mutual concern for each other's safety.

7. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, the Lizard teleports to the ship, ensuring that both characters are safe from the eruption. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures they are both healthy and safe.

By completing these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
