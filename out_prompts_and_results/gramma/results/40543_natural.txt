To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move away from the market where the guard is present, allowing her to safely reach the crossroads.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - The bandit needs to go to the cottage to access the chest where she can store the coins she has taken.

3. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the chest.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin, which she can then carry with her.

4. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit needs to return to the crossroads to be in a more central location for future actions.

5. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - Finally, the bandit moves to the bandit camp to store the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
