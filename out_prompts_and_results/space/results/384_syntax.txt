To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave to ensure that both she and the Lizard are in a safer location away from the danger of the erupting volcano. This action is necessary for both characters to maintain their health and safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are in a safe location together.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action highlights the danger of the surface and emphasizes the importance of their decision to move to the cave.

By taking these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with Zoe.
