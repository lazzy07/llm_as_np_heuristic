To achieve Bubba's goal of having 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** (Bubba already wants to have money, so this action is reaffirming his goal.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, and since the clerk has 0 money, shooting the clerk will allow Bubba to take the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

This sequence of actions is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money while ensuring that the story remains concise and focused on the objective.
