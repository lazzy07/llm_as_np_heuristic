1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit needs to be at the crossroads to interact with other characters and potentially rob or deceive them.

   - The bandit is looking for opportunities to acquire coins, and the market is a place where the merchant is present.

3. **The bandit attacks the merchant.**  
   - The bandit is armed and can attack the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine and any coins the merchant may have.

4. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse.**  
   - After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit can loot the merchant's body to acquire the medicine and any coins the merchant was carrying.

5. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - With the medicine and any coins acquired from the merchant, the bandit returns to the camp to secure the items.

### Explanation of Actions
- The bandit first moves to the crossroads and then to the market to confront the merchant. The attack on the merchant is crucial as it allows the bandit to take items without needing to worry about the guard, who is at the market but not directly involved in the confrontation. Looting the merchant's corpse ensures the bandit collects the medicine and any coins, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. Finally, returning to the bandit camp secures the stolen items.
