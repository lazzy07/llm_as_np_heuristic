**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** 
   - This action is necessary because Dr. Hathaway needs to confirm Ross's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Ross is showing a rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with steroids.**
   - This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition. By treating him with the appropriate medication for Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway ensures that Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to address the other patients.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is important to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C with antibiotics.**
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (since his symptoms were unknown), this action is necessary to ensure that he becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway checks on Young.

7. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Young is also treated.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is important to determine Young's symptoms, which are also unknown.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B with antibiotics.**
   - Assuming Young also has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure that Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring they are all healthy.
