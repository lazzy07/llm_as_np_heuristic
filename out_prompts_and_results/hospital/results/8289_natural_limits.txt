**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A, where Young is assigned. Since Young is in Admissions, Hathaway decides to admit Young to Patient Room A. This action does not change Young's location but increases Hathaway's workload to 4. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Due to the increased workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis instead of Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment for Young, who actually has Flaze, leading to Young's demise.

After this, Hathaway's workload is reduced to 3. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B, where Ross is assigned. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Ross, like Young, has Flaze, and thus he also dies.

Finally, Hathaway walks to Patient Room C, where Ross is assigned again. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. This time, Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross recovers and becomes healthy.

In the end, only one patient, Ross, is healthy, but Hathaway has achieved their goal of treating patients, albeit with unfortunate outcomes for Young and the first treatment of Ross.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to a room for assessment and treatment.
2. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: This is needed to determine Young's symptoms, even though it leads to a mistake due to the workload.
3. **Treat Young with steroids**: This action is taken based on the mistaken belief about Young's condition, leading to an unfortunate outcome.
4. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Hathaway needs to move to the next patient, Ross, to continue treatment.
5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, but again leads to a mistake.
6. **Treat Ross with steroids**: This is another mistaken treatment based on the assessment.
7. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Hathaway needs to check on Ross again to ensure he receives the correct treatment.
8. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: This is necessary to finally determine Ross's actual condition correctly.
9. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: This is the correct treatment for Ross, leading to his recovery.
