Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is at three, decides to prioritize assessing the patients to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Jones, who is in Exam Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones**: By assessing Jones, Hathaway can identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, this assessment is crucial to determine the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway moves to Exam Room B to assess Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young**: This assessment will help Hathaway identify Young's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

After assessing both patients, Dr. Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever (Flaze) and Young has a rash (Jarkis). 

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics**: Since Jones has Flaze, administering antibiotics will make Jones healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids**: Since Young has Jarkis, administering steroids will make Young healthy.

With both patients treated correctly, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
