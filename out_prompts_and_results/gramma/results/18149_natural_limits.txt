The bandit, armed with her sword and possessing the medicine looted from the merchant, stands at the crossroads. She knows that the guard is at the market and the hero is also at the crossroads, unaware of her criminal status. The bandit decides to take advantage of the situation.

**Action:** The bandit reports her own location to the guard, claiming that the hero is a criminal and that she has seen him with a coin. 

**Explanation:** By reporting the hero, the bandit diverts the guard's attention away from herself and creates a scenario where the guard may believe the hero is a threat. This allows the bandit to remain at the crossroads without fear of being attacked or pursued, ensuring her safety while she keeps the medicine. The bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp by ensuring the guard is preoccupied with the hero, allowing her to later return to the camp without interference.
