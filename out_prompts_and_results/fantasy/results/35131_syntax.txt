To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are now engaged, and also on acquiring wealth. Since Talia is currently in the Village and Rory is with her, they can work together to achieve their goals.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth to fulfill her goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action is crucial as it adds to their wealth, which is a shared goal between Talia and Rory.

4. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the Village with the treasure. This action is necessary to reunite with Talia and share their newfound wealth.

5. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married. This action is essential because it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through a loving relationship.
