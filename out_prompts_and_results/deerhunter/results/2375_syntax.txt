To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but provides a logical conclusion to the story, showing Bubba leaving the bank with the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest, concluding the story with him having the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is already dead.
