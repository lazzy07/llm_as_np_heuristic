Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Jones is alive and healthy. After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload and treats him with steroids. This treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway, now with a workload of 2, correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway, with a workload of 2, assesses him and correctly identifies his symptoms as Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, and he also becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
