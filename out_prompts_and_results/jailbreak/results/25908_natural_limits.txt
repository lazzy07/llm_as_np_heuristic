**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he finds himself face-to-face with the bully. The gym door is locked, and the bully is unaware of Roy's presence. Roy, feeling the weight of the knife in his pocket, knows this is his chance to protect himself and Ernest. He swiftly pulls out the knife and, with a surge of adrenaline, he attacks the bully, killing him instantly. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he needs to get back to Ernest. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. Now, he can safely make his way to the hallway and escape the prison.
