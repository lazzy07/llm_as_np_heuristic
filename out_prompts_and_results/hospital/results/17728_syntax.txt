To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to confirm their symptoms. Since Young is currently in PatientRoomA and has been assigned there, this action is necessary to determine the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on the symptoms observed. Since Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids.

3. **Walk Jones to Exam Room C**: After treating Young, Hathaway will need to admit and assess Jones, who is currently in the admissions room. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones also receives the appropriate care.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room C, which is necessary for the next step of assessing Jones.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment for their symptoms. Since Jones has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics.
