To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Since we don't know the symptoms of Jones, Ross, and Young yet, we will first assess Jones in Exam Room A, then Ross in Exam Room C, and finally Young in Exam Room B. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms so that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.
2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross to find out his symptoms.
3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment.
5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross based on his assessment.
6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on his assessment.

Now, let's assume the following symptoms for the sake of this story:
- Jones has a fever (indicating Flaze).
- Ross has a rash (indicating Jarkis).
- Young has a fever (indicating Flaze).

Now, we can outline the actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, fever, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones and finds he has a fever.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, rash, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and finds he has a rash.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, fever, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Young and finds he has a fever.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics for Flaze.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids for Jarkis.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics for Flaze.

After these actions, all patients will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Assessing each patient** is crucial to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered.
- **Treating each patient** with the correct medication based on their symptoms ensures they recover and remain alive and healthy.
