To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, and since they are not fighting, it can be successful.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is important to further solidify their friendship and ensure they are both in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe will again make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in their new environment.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by their previous actions.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
