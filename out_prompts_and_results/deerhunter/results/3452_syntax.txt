To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank, and Bambi is also in the forest. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money. This action is necessary as it brings him to the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest after acquiring the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal but provides a sense of closure to the story.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk and secure the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action provides a narrative closure, showing Bubba leaving the bank after achieving his goal.
