In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy because they have the item they want (the chocolates, I3). Blake (C2) wants the flowers (I2) to be happy, but they are not happy yet either. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Casey to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22).

After this action, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is necessary because it allows Alex to receive the item they desire (jewelry), which will make them happy. Since Casey is already happy with the chocolates, they can afford to give away the jewelry.
