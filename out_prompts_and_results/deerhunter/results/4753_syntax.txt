To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can obtain from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will allow him to regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the bank clerk is located. This action is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get money.

3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Before confronting the bank clerk, Bubba will load his rifle with ammunition. This action is crucial because it gives him the power to intimidate the clerk and ensures he can steal the money if necessary.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will then steal the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the loaded rifle. This action is the direct means for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

5. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will leave the bank and return to the forest with the stolen money. This action signifies that he has successfully achieved his goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba eats Bambi**: Satisfies his hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal.
2. **Bubba goes to the bank**: Moves to the location where he can confront the bank clerk for money.
3. **Bubba loads his rifle**: Prepares himself to intimidate the clerk, ensuring he can steal the money.
