To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants item I2 (chocolates), which is currently in the living room (R21). 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and potentially get the chocolates.

2. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the chocolates. This is a lie, as Alex actually wants I1 (flowers). However, this action is intended to manipulate the situation to get Casey to act.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) to find the chocolates, believing that Alex wants them. This is necessary for Casey to retrieve the item that Blake wants.

4. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the living room. This is essential as it allows Casey to have the item that Blake wants.

5. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) with the chocolates. This is necessary for the next action where Casey can give the chocolates to Blake.

6. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the item, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the chocolates, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to influence the situation.
- **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: This action is a strategic lie to manipulate Casey into thinking Alex wants the chocolates, prompting her to act.
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to go to the living room to find the chocolates, believing she is fulfilling Alex's desire.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey must pick up the chocolates to eventually give them to Blake.
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the dining room to complete the transfer of the chocolates.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: This final action is crucial as it directly results in Blake's happiness.
