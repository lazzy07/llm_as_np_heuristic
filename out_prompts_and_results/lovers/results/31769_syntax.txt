To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake wants item I2, which is currently unknown to us. However, we can deduce that since Casey is in the same room as Blake and has put down item I1, Blake can take action to acquire I1, which will help them achieve happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom to check for item I2, which they believe is there.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to explore the possibility of finding the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up item I2 from the bedroom.
   - This action is crucial as it allows Casey to acquire the item they want, which is necessary for their happiness.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room where Blake is.
   - This action is important for Casey to deliver the item to Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives item I2 to Blake.
   - This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for item I2, making them happy.

5. **put_down(C2, I1, R22)**: Blake puts down item I1, which they no longer need.
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to clear the space and signify that they have achieved their goal.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have received the item they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the transfer of the desired item (I2) to Blake, ensuring that Blake's happiness is achieved.
- The movement and picking up of items are necessary to navigate the rooms and acquire the items.
- The giving action is the key moment where Blake's goal is achieved.
