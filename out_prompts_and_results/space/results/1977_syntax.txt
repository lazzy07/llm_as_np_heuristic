To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a character's death. The goal is to create a scenario where the characters can become friends, but the eruption will ultimately lead to one of them dying.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface from the ship, where the volcano is active. This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the dangerous environment where the volcano can erupt.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface, where Zoe is. This action is important as it brings both characters together in the same location, allowing for potential interaction.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace with each other. This action is crucial as it establishes a friendship between the two characters, fulfilling their goal of making friends.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's death.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action results in the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

In this sequence, Zoe and the Lizard successfully become friends before the volcano erupts, leading to one of them dying. The story ends with the eruption, fulfilling the conditions set forth.
