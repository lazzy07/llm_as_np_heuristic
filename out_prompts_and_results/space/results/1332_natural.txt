Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to confront the Lizard and try to make peace. She believes that if they can work together, they can find a way to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and attempt to establish a relationship, as she believes the Lizard is at the surface and she needs to be there to communicate.

2. **Zoe walks to the cave.** - Zoe needs to approach the Lizard directly to initiate a conversation and attempt to make peace. Walking allows her to reach the Lizard without causing anger.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows both characters to become friends, aligning with their mutual goals of being healthy and safe.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - The eruption is a natural consequence of the story's setting, and since both characters are now friends, they can work together to find a solution to the eruption, but it also leads to the death of one character.

5. **The Lizard dies.** - The Lizard, being on the surface when the volcano erupts, cannot escape in time, leading to its demise. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

The story ends with Zoe and the Lizard having made peace before the eruption, showcasing their desire for friendship, but ultimately, the Lizard's fate is sealed by the eruption.
