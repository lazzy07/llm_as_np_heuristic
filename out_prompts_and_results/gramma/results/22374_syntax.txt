To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to obtain the medicine from the Merchant.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant using one of the coins he is carrying. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom walks back to the Crossroads. This is a necessary step to get back to the path leading to the cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
