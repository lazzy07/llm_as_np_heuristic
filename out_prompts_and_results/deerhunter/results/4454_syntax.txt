To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and has already shot and eaten Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to acquire money, and the clerk has money that Bubba wants.

2. **Go**: After stealing the money, Bubba can leave the bank. This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but can be included to signify that Bubba has completed his goal and is moving away from the scene.

The final story will be as follows:

1. Bubba, having just eaten Bambi, enters the bank with a loaded rifle.
2. He sees the bank clerk and, driven by greed, decides to steal the money from the clerk.
3. Bubba successfully steals the money from the clerk, fulfilling his goal of acquiring money.
4. (Optional) Bubba leaves the bank, satisfied with his actions.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring money.
- **Go(Bubba, Bank, ?)**: This action signifies Bubba's departure from the bank after successfully stealing the money, although it is not necessary for the ending.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, ?)"
  ]
}
```

In conclusion, the story ends with Bubba having the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead, fulfilling the requirements of the task.
