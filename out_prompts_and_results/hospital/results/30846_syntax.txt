To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomB where Young is located and assess Young's symptoms. This is important to determine the correct treatment for Young as well.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. Similar to Ross, if Young has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze, and if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room where Jones is located and assess his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are treated.
