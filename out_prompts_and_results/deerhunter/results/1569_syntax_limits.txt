In this story, Bubba is driven by greed and hunger, while Bambi's goal is to stay alive. The bank clerk is also greedy but is not directly involved in the conflict with Bubba and Bambi. The story will focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money, which can be done by either stealing from the bank clerk or killing Bambi for food.

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, having loaded his rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is motivated by his hunger and the need to eat, as well as the potential to eliminate a threat to his own survival. By killing Bambi, he can eat and also potentially gain some satisfaction from his greed.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This satisfies his hunger and allows him to survive longer in the forest.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: With his hunger satisfied, Bubba can now focus on his greed. He decides to go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk, who is still at the bank.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba achieving his goals of satisfying his hunger and fulfilling his greed.
