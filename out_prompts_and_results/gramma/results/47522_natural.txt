To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the merchant and the hero, who are at the crossroads.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, increasing her coin count.

3. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit returns to her camp to secure her coins.

4. **The bandit places the coin in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit has coins stored safely in her chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is essential for the bandit to reach the crossroads where the merchant and hero are located.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the bandit to acquire coins without being a criminal in the eyes of the guard, as the merchant is not a criminal and is an easy target.
- The third action is necessary for the bandit to return to her safe location after committing the robbery.
- The final action secures the coins in the chest, which is the ultimate goal of the bandit.
