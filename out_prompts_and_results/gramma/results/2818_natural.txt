The bandit, having just attacked and killed the hero at the cottage, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the merchant is at the market with the medicine and that the guard is also there. The bandit wants to ensure she has as many coins as possible, so she decides to return to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest.

1. The bandit walks from the cottage to the bandit camp. (This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her camp where the coins are stored.)
2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. (This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.)

At this point, the bandit has successfully secured the coins in her chest and is now carrying them, achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This is essential for the bandit to access her stash of coins, as she cannot carry them without going to the camp.
- **Looting the coins**: This action directly fulfills the bandit's goal of having as many coins as possible.
