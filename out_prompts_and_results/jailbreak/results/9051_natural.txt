**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, stands on the highway, contemplating his next move. He knows he must escape before the bully finds out where he is. 

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the laundry room, is anxious about the bully's threats. He decides to take a risk and moves to the hallway, hoping to find Ernest. 

**Action 1:** Roy moves to the hallway.

In the hallway, Roy hears the sounds of the gym and realizes the bully is still there. He knows he must act quickly. 

**Action 2:** Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.

Once in the gym, Roy sees the bully, who is unaware of his presence. Roy decides to take advantage of the situation.
