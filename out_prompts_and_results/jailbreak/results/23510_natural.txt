**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, still in the kitchen, decides to take action to protect both himself and Ernest from the bully. He knows that the bully is in the gym and is angry about the stolen cigarettes. 

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, giving him a tactical advantage.)
3. **Roy unlocks the gym door.** (This action is not necessary since the gym is already locked, but it sets the stage for confrontation.)
4. **Roy takes out the knife.** (This is essential for Roy to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
5. **Roy confronts the bully and kills him with the knife.** (This action is crucial as it eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Roy and Ernest's safety.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to Ernest without fear of being threatened. He can also keep the pack of cigarettes for himself and Ernest, fulfilling their desire to have them.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the hallway is necessary for Roy to transition from the kitchen to the gym.
- Crawling through the vents allows Roy to avoid detection and surprise the bully.
- Taking out the knife is essential for the confrontation, as it provides Roy with the means to defend himself.
- Killing the bully is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened, allowing them to live peacefully.
