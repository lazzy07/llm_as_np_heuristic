To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young is already in Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room B. This is important to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Jones, who is currently in the admissions room. This is crucial to identify Jones's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This will help Young become healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure Ross also becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment after assessing his symptoms. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can effectively assess and treat all patients, achieving the goal of making them healthy.
