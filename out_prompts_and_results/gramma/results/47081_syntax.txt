To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the TomCoin that Tom is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit robs Tom to acquire the TomCoin, which increases her wealth and helps her achieve her goal of carrying more coins.
- The Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest, ensuring that she has coins secured in her preferred location.
