The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the guard is now the only threat. She decides to take action to secure her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. The bandit approaches the guard and attacks him, hoping to eliminate the only obstacle in her way.

The guard, unarmed and caught off guard, falls to the bandit's attack. With the guard defeated, the bandit now has the opportunity to loot the merchant's body for the medicine and any remaining coins. She finds the hero's coin on the merchant's corpse, adding it to her collection.

Now, with the hero's coin and the medicine in her possession, the bandit returns to her camp, satisfied with her haul.

2. **Bandit loots the merchant**: After defeating the guard, the bandit takes the opportunity to loot the merchant's body, which allows her to acquire the hero's coin and the medicine.
