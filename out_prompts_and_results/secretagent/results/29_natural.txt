To complete the story, we need to ensure that the secret agent achieves their goal of killing the mastermind. Since the mastermind is already dead, the secret agent's goal is effectively achieved. However, we can add a few actions to wrap up the story and confirm the secret agent's success.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. (This action is necessary to exit the office and confirm the secret agent's presence in a more public area.)
2. The secret agent moves from the lobby to the courtyard. (This action allows the secret agent to leave the lobby and be in a location that connects to the dropbox.)
3. The secret agent moves from the courtyard to the dropbox. (This action is necessary to return to the dropbox, which is a key location in the story.)
4. The secret agent moves from the dropbox to the headquarters. (This action allows the secret agent to return to the headquarters, signifying the end of their mission.)

After these actions, the secret agent is confirmed to have completed their mission successfully, as the mastermind is already dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Move to the lobby**: This action is necessary to transition from the office to a more open area, indicating the secret agent's awareness of their surroundings.
- **Move to the courtyard**: This action signifies the secret agent's movement towards a more strategic location.
- **Move to the dropbox**: This action is part of the secret agent's journey back to a significant location, reinforcing their role in the mission.
- **Move to the headquarters**: This action concludes the secret agent's journey, symbolizing the completion of their task.
