In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The Merchant is currently at the Crossroads, and the Bandit is at the Bandit Camp, where she has coins in her chest. The Merchant can take advantage of the situation by reporting the Bandit’s location to the Guard, who is at the Market. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit's location to the Guard. This action is crucial because it helps the Merchant achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. By reporting the Bandit, the Merchant ensures that the Guard will take action against the Bandit, potentially leading to the Bandit being killed or captured, which would allow the Merchant to claim the coins without any risk of being labeled a criminal herself.

After this action, the Merchant can expect that the Guard will deal with the Bandit, allowing her to safely collect coins from the Bandit’s chest later.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant reports the Bandit’s location to the Guard, which is a strategic move to ensure that the Bandit is dealt with. This action aligns with the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as it places the responsibility of dealing with the Bandit on the Guard.
