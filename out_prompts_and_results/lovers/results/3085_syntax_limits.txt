In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is not happy because they want the item I1 (which is in C2, held by Casey), and Blake is also not happy because they want the item I2 (which is in R21). Casey is happy because they have the item I3 (which is in C3). 

To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the item I2 (which they want) with Casey for item I1 (which Alex wants). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they desire while also helping Alex to become happy.

After the trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have I1, making them happy.
- Alex will have I2, making them happy as well.
- Casey will still have I3, remaining happy.

This single action achieves the goal of making Blake happy while also ensuring that Alex is happy, fulfilling Blake's desire to see Alex happy.
