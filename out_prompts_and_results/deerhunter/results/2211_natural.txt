To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, to ensure the story flows logically, we can include a few actions that reinforce the situation without changing the outcome.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba goes to the forest where Bambi is located.)
3. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot Bambi, who is a deer.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba can now eat Bambi since it is dead.)
5. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (This action satisfies Bubba's hunger.)

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, and he has also satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi. The actions taken are necessary to show Bubba's motivations and the consequences of his actions, while still ensuring he retains his money.
