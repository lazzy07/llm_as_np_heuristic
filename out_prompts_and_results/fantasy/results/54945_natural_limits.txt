In this story, Talia's goal is to become happy or wealthy, and she currently has the treasure, which is a valuable item. To achieve her goal, Talia can take the following action:

1. **Talia gives the treasure to Gargax.** This action is taken because Gargax, being a dragon, is likely to value the treasure highly.
