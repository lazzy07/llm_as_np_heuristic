To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s a concise story that leads to that outcome:

1. **Casey moves to the bedroom (R12)**: This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex, who currently has the jewelry (I1).
   - Action: `move(C3, R22, R12)`

2. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3)**: This action is important because it communicates Casey's desire directly to Alex, who can then act on it.
   - Action: `tell(C3, C1, I3, R12)`

3. **Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey**: Since Alex wants Casey to be happy, they will give Casey the jewelry, fulfilling Casey's desire.
   - Action: `give(C1, I1, C3, R12)`

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they wanted, making them happy.
