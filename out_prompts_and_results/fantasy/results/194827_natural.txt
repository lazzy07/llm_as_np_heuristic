To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** - Vince needs to go to the cave to access the treasure, which is essential for increasing his wealth.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.** - By picking up the treasure, Vince will increase his wealth, which is one of his goals.

3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** - Vince needs to return to the village to be with Talia and Rory, which will help him achieve happiness.

4. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia.** - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant but can be seen as a reaffirmation of his commitment to Talia.

5. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** - This action is necessary to ensure that Talia is happy, which indirectly contributes to Vince's happiness.

6. **Vince and Talia get married.** - This solidifies their relationship and contributes to Vince's happiness.

7. **Vince becomes hungry.** - This action is necessary to show that Vince is not currently satisfied, but it will be resolved shortly.

8. **Talia gives Vince some money.** - Talia can give Vince some of her money to help him not be hungry.

9. **Vince eats.** - This action resolves Vince's hunger.

After these actions, Vince will have achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage to Talia), wealthy (by acquiring the treasure), and not hungry (by eating after receiving money from Talia).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave** allows Vince to access the treasure, which is crucial for his wealth.
- **Picking up the treasure** directly increases his wealth.
- **Traveling back to the village** is necessary for social interaction and achieving happiness.
- **Proposing and accepting marriage** reinforces the bond with Talia, contributing to happiness.
- **Becoming hungry** and then **eating** resolves his hunger, fulfilling all his goals.
