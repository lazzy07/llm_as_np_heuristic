Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room B, where Jones is assigned but has not yet been assessed. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to reduce their workload before proceeding.

1. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. This action is necessary to reduce the workload and to ensure that Young is healthy, as they are currently unassessed.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. This action is crucial to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, allowing Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Assuming Young shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This action is essential for Young to become healthy.

4. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to assess Jones. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is also healthy.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. This action is crucial to determine if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, allowing Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Assuming Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics. This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both Young and Jones, ensuring they are both healthy.
