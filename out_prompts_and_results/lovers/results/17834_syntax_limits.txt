To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Alex is currently in the dining room (R12) and the flowers are in the dining room (R22), we can facilitate this with a single action.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Action: move(C1, R12, R22)** - Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) where the flowers (I1) are located. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

After this action, Alex will be in the same room as the flowers, allowing them to pick them up in the next step, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The only action taken is moving Alex to the room where the flowers are located. This is essential for Alex to eventually pick up the flowers and become happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["move(C1, R12, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex can achieve their goal of happiness by being in the right location to obtain the item they desire.
