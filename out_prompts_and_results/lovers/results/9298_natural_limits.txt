In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex, who wants the flowers, realizes that Casey has them. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to take action.

**Action: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.**

- **Explanation:** Alex knows that Casey wants the jewelry, which is currently with Alex. By giving the jewelry to Casey, Alex hopes to make Casey happy. Since Casey has the flowers, this trade will encourage Casey to give the flowers to Alex in return, as Casey wants to be happy too.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Casey is happy because they received the jewelry.
- Blake remains unhappy because they still do not have the chocolates.

This single action allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers.
