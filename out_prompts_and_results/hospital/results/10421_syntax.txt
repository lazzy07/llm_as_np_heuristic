To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Similarly, Young is also in the admissions room and has not been assessed. Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If he shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, if he shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If he shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This action is also essential for Young's recovery.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms so that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms for appropriate treatment.
3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Ross based on the symptoms assessed.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Young based on the symptoms assessed.

By following these actions, Hathaway will ensure that both Ross and Young receive the appropriate treatment, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat both patients effectively, leading to their health and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
