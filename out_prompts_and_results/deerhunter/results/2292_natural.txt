To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also alive in the forest, and Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This will also fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action will result in Bambi being dead, allowing Bubba to eat her and satisfy his hunger.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, which will satisfy his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
