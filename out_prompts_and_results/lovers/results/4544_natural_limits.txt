In the living room, Alex, who is already happy with the flowers, sees that Blake and Casey are not happy. Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. To help them achieve their happiness, Alex decides to take action.

**Action:** Alex picks up the jewelry from the living room and gives it to Casey.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy. Since Alex is already happy with the flowers, this action does not affect Alex's happiness but helps fulfill Casey's goal. After this action, Casey is happy, and Blake is still not happy, but Alex's goal of ensuring happiness for Casey is achieved.
