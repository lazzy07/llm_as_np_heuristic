Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A, where Ross is experiencing a rash. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway must treat Ross for Jarkis, which is indicated by the rash. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Explanation: Since Ross is showing a rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis and administers the appropriate treatment (steroids). This action reduces Hathaway's workload by one, bringing it down to 2, and Ross becomes healthy.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   - Explanation: After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess the remaining patients. By walking to Admissions, Hathaway can check on Jones and Young, who are both currently unassessed.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room. Admitting Jones to Patient Room B allows Hathaway to manage the patients effectively and reduces the workload by one.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - Explanation: Since Young is still in Admissions, Dr. Hathaway assesses him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Young receives the necessary treatment if needed.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross and ensures that all patients are accounted for, thus achieving the goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
