In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She is already married to Vince, which gives her some happiness, and she possesses money, which contributes to her wealth. However, she does not have treasure yet, which is essential for her to achieve her goal of being wealthy.

To achieve her goal, Talia can take the following actions:

1. **Travel from the Village to the Cave**: Talia will travel to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary because the treasure is not in the village, and Talia needs to be at the same location as the treasure to pick it up.
