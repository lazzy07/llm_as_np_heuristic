Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients currently in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment, increasing Hathaway's workload to 3.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.** (This action allows Hathaway to assess Jones, who is currently in Patient Room C.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.** (This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C with antibiotics.** (Assuming Jones has Flaze, this treatment is necessary to make Jones healthy.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** (This action allows Hathaway to assess and treat Young next.)
