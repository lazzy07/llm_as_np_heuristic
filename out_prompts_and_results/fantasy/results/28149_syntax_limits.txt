To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy (or both), we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage or wealth through acquiring money or treasure. Given the current situation, Talia has two marriage proposals from Rory and Vince, and Vince has money.

The most straightforward way to ensure Talia becomes happy is for her to accept one of the marriage proposals. Since both Rory and Vince have proposed to her, she can accept one of them. This will make her happy, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the plan:

1. **Accept Rory's proposal**: This will make Talia happy, as she will be marrying Rory, who also desires happiness.
   
This action is chosen because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her primary goals.

The final story is as follows:

1. Talia accepts Rory's proposal in the Village, making her happy.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["accept(Rory, Talia, Village)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia achieves her goal of happiness with the least number of actions.
