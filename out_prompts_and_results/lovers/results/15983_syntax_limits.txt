In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex currently has the item they want (I3 - flowers), but Blake does not have what they want (I2 - chocolates). To achieve their goal, Blake can trade their item (I1 - jewelry) with Alex for the item Alex wants (I3 - flowers). This will make both Blake and Alex happy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the jewelry they have for the flowers that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want (I2 - chocolates) indirectly by ensuring Alex is happy with the flowers, which is part of Blake's goal.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake is happy because they have traded for the flowers.
- Alex is happy because they have received jewelry in exchange for the flowers.
- Casey remains unhappy, but that does not affect Blake's goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R22)"]
