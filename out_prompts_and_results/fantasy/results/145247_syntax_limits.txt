In this story, Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and wants to be wealthy. The only way for Gargax to achieve this goal is to eat a human who possesses money. Since Vince is dead and has money, Gargax can take the money from Vince's body.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body in the cave. This action fulfills Gargax's desire to be wealthy, as he now possesses the money.

This is the shortest story that allows Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth while also addressing his hunger indirectly by eliminating a character who is no longer alive.

- **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Gargax needs to acquire wealth, and the only available money is with Vince, who is dead. By taking the money, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy.
