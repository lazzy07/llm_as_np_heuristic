To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the item they want.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This is a strategic lie because Alex actually wants the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary to manipulate the situation to their advantage.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R22) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to be in the right position to pick up the jewelry.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I1) from the bedroom. This is necessary because it allows Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and influence the situation.
- **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: By lying about wanting the flowers, Alex can manipulate Casey's actions to ultimately get the jewelry.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to go to the bedroom to pick up the jewelry.
- **pick_up(C2, I1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry that Alex desires.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey must return to the dining room to give the jewelry to Alex.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the final action that fulfills Alex's desire and makes them happy.
