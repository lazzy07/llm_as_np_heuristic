To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Currently, Alex is in the living room (R21) and does not have the flowers. The flowers are with Casey in the dining room (R22). 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey for the flowers (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to eventually get the flowers they want, as Blake is aware that Alex wants the flowers.

After the trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they will have the flowers.
- Blake will have the flowers, which they can later give to Alex.
- Casey will have the chocolates, which they wanted.

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
``` 

In summary, the trade action is the only necessary step to ensure Alex's happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
