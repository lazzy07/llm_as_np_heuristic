To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake's Goal**: Blake wants to be happy, which means they need to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2).
2. **Current Situation**: 
   - Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
   - Casey (C3) is not happy because they do not have the chocolates (I3).
   - Blake (C2) is not happy because they do not have the jewelry (I2).

### Actions to Achieve Blake's Goal:

1. **Tell Blake that Casey wants the jewelry**: 
   - **Action**: `tell(C1, C2, I2, R22)`
   - **Reason**: Alex can tell Blake that Casey wants the jewelry, which may prompt Blake to consider trading or giving items to Casey to make them happy, thus indirectly helping Alex.

3. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey**: 
   - **Action**: `give(C2, I3, C3, R22)`
   - **Reason**: By giving the chocolates to Casey, Blake makes Casey happy, which aligns with Blake's desire to make Alex happy.

4. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake**: 
   - **Action**: `give(C3, I2, C2, R22)`
   - **Reason**: Since Casey is now happy with the chocolates, they can give the jewelry (I2) to Blake, making Blake happy.
