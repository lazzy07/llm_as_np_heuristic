To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom walks to the market where the merchant is located to buy the medicine.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using one of the coins he is carrying.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom walks back to the crossroads with the medicine.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

However, since we want to keep the story as short as possible, we can combine the actions into a single action that leads directly to Tom's goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom walks to the market where the merchant is located to buy the medicine.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using one of the coins he is carrying.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom walks directly to the cottage with the medicine.

This results in the following sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom goes to the market.
2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine.
3. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom goes to the cottage.

In this case, the shortest story where Tom achieves his goal is:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom walks to the market.
2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine.
3. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom walks to the cottage.

This is the most efficient way for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)",
    "buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary for Tom to successfully obtain the medicine and reach his desired location, the cottage.
