**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A with a workload of 3. Jones, who is in Patient Room C, needs to be assessed for symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is high, there is a risk of making a mistake if he assesses Jones. However, Jones is determined to be healthy and alive.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway decides to assess Jones despite the risk of making a mistake. He believes Jones is alive and healthy, but he needs to check for symptoms. He assesses Jones and mistakenly believes he has Jarkis instead of Flaze due to his high workload.

2. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking he has Jarkis. Fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis, but the treatment does not harm him since he is still alive. 

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to check on the other patients, reducing his workload.

4. **Admit Young**: Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, where he can be assessed later.

5. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young, who is healthy, and admits him to the treatment plan.

In this scenario, Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, even though Hathaway made a mistake in diagnosis. The treatment did not harm him, and he remains alive.
