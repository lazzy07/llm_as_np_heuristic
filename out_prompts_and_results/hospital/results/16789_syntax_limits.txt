Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room B, where Ross is assigned but not yet assessed. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there's a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. To ensure all patients become healthy, Hathaway needs to reduce their workload first.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is not yet assessed, this action is necessary to determine his symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross shows a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. If he has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess and treat Young. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated and healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can effectively reduce their workload and ensure that both Ross and Young receive the necessary treatment to become healthy.
