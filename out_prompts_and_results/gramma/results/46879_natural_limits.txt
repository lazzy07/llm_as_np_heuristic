The bandit, seeing the hero at the market with the medicine, decides to take action. The bandit approaches the hero and, since the hero is unarmed, the bandit attacks and kills the hero. After the hero falls, the bandit loots the medicine from the hero's corpse. With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit returns to the bandit camp, satisfied with her haul.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit attacks the hero:** This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the hero, who is a potential threat and is carrying the medicine.
2. **The bandit loots the medicine from the hero's corpse:** After successfully attacking the hero, the bandit takes the medicine, which is part of her goal to carry as many coins or valuable items as possible.
3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp:** This action is included to show that the bandit returns to her preferred location with the medicine, fulfilling her goal of having valuable items.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying valuable items (the medicine) by eliminating the hero.
