In the current situation, the Merchant is at the Market with the Medicine and is aware of the Bandit, who is also present. The Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The Bandit, having attacked Tom, is a threat to the Merchant's safety and could potentially rob her.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following actions:

1. **Report(Bandit, Market, Guard)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit’s location to the Guard. This action is crucial because it alerts the Guard to the presence of a criminal, which could lead to the Bandit being dealt with, thus ensuring the Merchant's safety and allowing her to continue her business without fear of robbery.

2. **Buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: After reporting the Bandit, the Merchant can buy the Medicine from herself using the coin she has. This action allows her to acquire the Medicine, which she can sell later for more coins, thus achieving her goal of maximizing her coin collection without engaging in criminal activity.

The story is concise and focuses on the Merchant's actions to ensure her safety and financial gain.
