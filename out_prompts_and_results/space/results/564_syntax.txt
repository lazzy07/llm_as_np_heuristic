To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is crucial because it places Zoe in a dangerous location where the eruption will occur.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: This action is included to ensure that the Lizard and Zoe have a moment of friendship before the eruption occurs. However, since Zoe is on the surface when the eruption happens, the peace made will be in the context of their last moments together.

The final sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing for the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard to be established.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Moves Zoe into the danger zone, setting her up for the eruption.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Causes the volcano to erupt, leading to Zoe's demise.
- **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, even if it is in the context of their last moments.
