In this story, we want to ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we need to assess Jones to determine their symptoms and then treat them accordingly.

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway, who is currently in PatientRoomB with Jones, will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because knowing the symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will assume that Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's symptoms.

2. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the identified symptoms. If Jones has a fever, they will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make Jones healthy. If they have a rash, they will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. We will assume that Jones has a fever and receives the correct treatment.

By following these two actions, Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones**: This action is crucial to determine the correct treatment for Jones. Without this assessment, Hathaway would not know how to proceed with the treatment.
- **Treating Jones**: This action is the final step to ensure that Jones receives the appropriate care based on their symptoms, leading to their recovery.
