**Story Completion:**

Indiana Jones, having successfully traveled back to the USA with the Ark of the Covenant, realizes that the U.S. Army is also in the USA and is eager to secure the Ark for their own purposes. Understanding the danger of the Ark, he decides to take action to ensure it is safely in the hands of the U.S. Army.

1. **Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the U.S. Army.** This action is crucial because Indiana wants the U.S. Army to have the Ark, and by giving it to them, he achieves his goal of ensuring it is in safe hands.

The Nazis, still at Tanis, are unaware of Indiana's actions and cannot intervene since they are not in the same location. They believe the Ark is dangerous, which further prevents them from attempting to take it.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Give the Ark to the U.S. Army:** This is the only action needed to fulfill Indiana's goal of ensuring the Ark is with the U.S. Army. Since the Ark is dangerous, Indiana's decision to give it away rather than open it is a strategic move to prevent any potential disaster.
