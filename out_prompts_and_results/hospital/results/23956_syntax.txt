To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics; if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Young, who is currently there. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
