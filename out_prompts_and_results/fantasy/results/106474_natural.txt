To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure from the cave. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location where the treasure is located.

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, which contributes to their wealth.

3. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Gargax needs to return to the village after obtaining the treasure.

4. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action satisfies Gargax's hunger, as Gargax is currently hungry and needs to eat to fulfill that need.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (by obtaining the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Rory).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave** is essential for Gargax to access the treasure.
- **Picking up the treasure** is the key action that fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth.
- **Traveling back to the village** is necessary for Gargax to be in a safe location after acquiring the treasure.
