To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just shot Bambi (the deer), and is hungry. He also knows that the bank clerk has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, which is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain energy.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the bank clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry. Eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After satisfying his hunger, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is the culmination of Bubba's plan to achieve his goal of getting money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk and take the money.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
