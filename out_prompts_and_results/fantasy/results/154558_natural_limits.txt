In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. The following actions will help Rory achieve this goal:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Gargax, who is at the village and has the opportunity to take the money from Vince's body.

2. **Gargax eats Vince.** This action allows Gargax to take the money that Vince has, which is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

3. **Rory takes the money from Gargax.** This action allows Rory to acquire the money that Gargax has taken from Vince, thus achieving wealth.

4. **Rory's happiness increases.** Since Rory is now wealthy and not hungry, he achieves his goal of happiness.

The story is as follows:

Rory travels from the cave to the village. Upon arriving, he finds Gargax, who has just eaten Vince. Gargax, having taken the money from Vince's body, is now in possession of it. Rory takes the money from Gargax, fulfilling his desire to be wealthy. With the money in hand and no hunger, Rory feels a sense of happiness, achieving his goal.
