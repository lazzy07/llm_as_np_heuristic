To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market and needs to move towards the Crossroads to get to the Cottage. This action is necessary to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom can then walk to the Cottage. This final action brings him to his desired location with the medicine he has.

These two actions are sufficient for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- The first action moves Tom from the Market to the Crossroads, which is a necessary step since he cannot go directly from the Market to the Cottage.
- The second action moves Tom from the Crossroads to the Cottage, completing his journey and fulfilling his goal.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:
