To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will result in one character dying. Since Zoe and the Lizard are already friends and both are safe and healthy, we can create a scenario where they decide to explore the surface together, leading to the eruption.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Zoe and the Lizard walk from the cave to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because it allows both characters to explore the dangerous surface together, which is part of their goal to make friends and understand each other better.

2. **The volcano on the surface begins to erupt.**  
   - This event is triggered as a consequence of their presence on the surface, creating a sense of urgency and danger.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to a safe distance from the volcano.**  
   - This action is taken to ensure both characters try to escape the eruption, showing their desire to stay healthy and safe.

4. **The volcano erupts.**  
   - This event leads to the climax of the story, resulting in one character dying. 

5. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

6. **The Lizard mourns Zoe and vows to protect the planet and its creatures.**  
   - This action signifies the Lizard's commitment to friendship and safety, ensuring that the bond they formed is honored even after Zoe's death.

In this story, the actions taken lead to the eruption of the volcano, resulting in Zoe's death while also highlighting the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. The Lizard's vow to protect the planet reflects the mutual goals of both characters.
