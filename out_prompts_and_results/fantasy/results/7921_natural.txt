To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to return to Talia, who is at the village, and to potentially share his wealth with her, which could lead to happiness.

2. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is alive and Rory wants to be happy, proposing marriage is a step towards achieving that happiness.

3. **Talia accepts the proposal.**  
   - Talia's acceptance of Rory's proposal will make both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

4. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that both characters are happy.

5. **Rory gives Talia the money.**  
   - By sharing his wealth with Talia, Rory increases their combined wealth, which contributes to his goal of being wealthy.

6. **Rory and Talia celebrate their marriage.**  
   - This celebration can be interpreted as a metaphorical action that signifies their happiness together.

At the end of these actions, Rory will have achieved his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
