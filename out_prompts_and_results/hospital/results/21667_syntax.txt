To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway should assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Young is also in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet. Hathaway should assess Young to determine his symptoms, similar to what was done for Ross.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both Ross and Young, ensuring that all patients are healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Ross based on the symptoms identified.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Young based on the symptoms identified.
