To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is the only other human present in the village, and Gargax can eat him. This action will also eliminate Rory, who is a competitor for wealth and happiness.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money from Vince's dead body. This action will increase Gargax's wealth.

3. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax will then travel back to the cave, where the treasure is located. This is necessary to ensure Gargax can keep the treasure safe and not be in the village where he has just committed an act of violence.

4. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax already has the treasure, but this action is included to signify that Gargax is now in a secure location with both the treasure and the money.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (with both the treasure and the money) and not hungry (having eaten Rory).
