To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to confirm whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. Since Jones has SymptomA, which is consistent with either Flaze or Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics (assuming SymptomA corresponds to Flaze). This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess and admit Ross, who is still in the admissions room. This action is not directly related to Jones's goal but is necessary for the overall hospital workflow.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to, which indirectly supports Jones's goal by maintaining a healthy hospital environment.

5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide Ross with the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are healthy, which contributes to the overall goal of the hospital.

1. **Assess(Jones)**: To determine Jones's symptoms.
