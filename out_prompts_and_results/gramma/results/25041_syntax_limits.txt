1. **report(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom, having just attacked the merchant and now being a criminal, is reported by the guard. This action is necessary because it allows the guard to be informed of Tom's criminal activity, which is essential for him to take action against Tom.

After this action, the guard can then proceed to confront Tom, fulfilling his goal of killing a criminal.

### Explanation of the Action:
