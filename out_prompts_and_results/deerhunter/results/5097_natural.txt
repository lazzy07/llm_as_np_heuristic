To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba in a safe position, as he has already committed violent acts.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the house.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to find a safe place after his violent actions in the forest.
2. **Bubba decides to eat.** - Bubba is hungry, and this action allows him to satisfy his hunger without needing to hunt again, as he has already killed Bambi.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger by consuming the deer he shot, ensuring he is no longer hungry.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, is no longer hungry, and is in a safe location (the house). The clerk remains at the bank, unaware of Bubba's actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the house**: This ensures Bubba is in a safe location after committing a violent act.
- **Deciding to eat**: This addresses Bubba's hunger, which is a basic need.
- **Eating Bambi**: This fulfills Bubba's hunger and utilizes the resources available to him after his actions.
