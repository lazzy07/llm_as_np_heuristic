To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just shot Bambi, and is feeling hungry and greedy. The bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, holding some money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, as she is dead. This action satisfies his hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal without the distraction of hunger.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will shoot the clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to steal the money from the clerk without resistance.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the clerk after shooting him. This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action addresses Bubba's hunger, which is important for his well-being and focus.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moving to the bank is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and access the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is critical for Bubba to eliminate the threat from the clerk and secure the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
