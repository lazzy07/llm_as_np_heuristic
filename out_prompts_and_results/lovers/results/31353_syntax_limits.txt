In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are currently in the dining room (R21) and the jewelry is with Casey (C2) in the dining room (R22). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the jewelry from Casey.

Here’s the action that Alex will take:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Casey is located. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary for Alex to obtain the item they want to be happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy. 

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- The first action allows Alex to reach Casey, who has the item Alex wants.
- The second action is the transfer of the jewelry from Casey to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
