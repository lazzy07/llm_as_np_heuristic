The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take action to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the merchant is present with the hero's coin. 

Once at the market, the bandit robs the merchant, taking the hero's coin from her. With this action, the bandit successfully increases her wealth without drawing the attention of the guard, who is also at the market but is focused on maintaining order.

Now, the bandit has the medicine and the hero's coin, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where she can interact with the merchant and the hero.
2. **Bandit robs the merchant**: This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin, which is essential for her goal of accumulating wealth.

The story is short and direct, with only two actions needed to achieve the bandit's goal.
