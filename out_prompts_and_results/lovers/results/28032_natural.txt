To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as the chocolates, which Blake wants. It sets up the next action where a trade can occur.

2. **Blake gives chocolates to Casey.**  
   - Blake is not happy and wants the chocolates. By giving them to Casey, Blake can potentially negotiate for the jewelry later.

3. **Casey gives jewelry to Blake.**  
   - Since Casey wants the jewelry and now has the chocolates, they can trade the chocolates for the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry, making them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Casey moving to the dining room** allows for interaction with Blake, who has the chocolates.
- **Blake giving chocolates to Casey** is a strategic move to make a trade possible, as Blake is still not happy and wants the chocolates.
- **Casey giving jewelry to Blake** completes the trade, allowing Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
