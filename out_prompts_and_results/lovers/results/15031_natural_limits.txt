In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy because they do not have the items they want. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Casey decides to take action. 

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.** This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and since it is currently with Alex, Casey needs to take it to be happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still in the living room with the flowers.
- Blake is still in the living room and still wants the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry.

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they wanted.
