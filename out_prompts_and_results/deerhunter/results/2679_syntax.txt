To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will need to go back to the bank to get it. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and focus on his next goal, which is to get money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can acquire money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and returns to the forest. This action is necessary for him to escape with the stolen money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and focus on his next goal.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can obtain money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire for money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Ensures Bubba escapes with the stolen money.
