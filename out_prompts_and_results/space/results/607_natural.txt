Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to take action to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there is a way to help the Lizard protect the planet. 

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This is a natural consequence of the story's setting, and it adds urgency to the situation. 

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption, which is a critical event in the story.

4. **The Lizard mourns Zoe's loss.** - This action is implied as a reaction to Zoe's death, which deepens the bond between them, showing that the Lizard values their friendship.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe's memory.** - This action symbolizes the Lizard's acceptance of Zoe's friendship and the impact she had on the planet, solidifying their bond even after her death.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard's feelings of friendship remain strong, ensuring that their connection is remembered.
