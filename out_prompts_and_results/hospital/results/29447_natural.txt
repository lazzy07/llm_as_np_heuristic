**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (the fever) due to the high workload. 

2. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the incorrect treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Young does not become healthy and dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway moves to assess Ross in Patient Room A.

3. **Walk from Patient Room B to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing symptoms of Jarkis. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect. Ross does not become healthy and dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Jones.

6. **Walk from Patient Room A to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions.

7. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis. Once more, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze.

8. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is incorrect. Jones does not become healthy and dies.

In the end, all patients die, but Dr. Hathaway's goal of assessing and treating patients is achieved, albeit with tragic results.
