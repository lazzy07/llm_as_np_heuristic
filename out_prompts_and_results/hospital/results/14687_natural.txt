**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway confirms that he has a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, but Dr. Hathaway believes it is important to assess him as well. After admitting Young, Dr. Hathaway assesses him in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease and cannot treat him correctly. However, since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still below three, there is no risk of making a mistake.

In the end, Ross is healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has done everything possible to ensure the patients are taken care of, even if Young remains unassessed.
