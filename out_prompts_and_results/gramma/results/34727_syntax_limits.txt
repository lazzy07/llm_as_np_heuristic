Tom is at the Crossroads, carrying the medicine he just bought. He sees the Bandit nearby, who is armed and poses a threat. To ensure his safety and to achieve his goal of getting to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the Bandit's location to the Guard, who is at the Market.

By reporting the Bandit, Tom ensures that the Guard can take action against the criminal, which will allow him to safely make his way to the cottage without the risk of being robbed or attacked.

**Action:**
- report(Tom, Bandit, Market)

This action is necessary because it directly leads to Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. By alerting the Guard, Tom can safely leave the Crossroads and head to the cottage without fear of the Bandit.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["report(Tom, Bandit, Market)"]
}
