   - Action: `tell(C2, C3, I3, R21)`

3. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from the living room (R21)**: Now that Casey believes Alex wants the jewelry, they will pick it up to give it to Alex.

   - Action: `give(C3, I3, C1, R22)`

5. **Blake picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R22)**: After receiving the jewelry, Alex is now happy, and Blake can now pick up the flowers to achieve their own happiness.
   - Action: `pick_up(C2, I1, R22)`
