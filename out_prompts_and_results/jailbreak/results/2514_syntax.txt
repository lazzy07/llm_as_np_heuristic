**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and the gym door is locked, which gives him a moment of safety. 

1. **Go to the Laundry**: Roy is already in the hallway, so he can easily access the laundry room where the civilian clothes are located.
2. **Steal the Civilian Clothes**: Roy steals the civilian clothes from the laundry room. This will allow him to disguise himself later for the escape.
3. **Go to the Hall**: Roy moves back to the hallway to regroup and plan his next move.
4. **Disguise (Roy)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This is crucial for his escape plan.
5. **Vent (Roy, Highway)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway, where he can escape the prison.

At this point, Roy has successfully escaped the prison while disguised, ensuring his safety and achieving his goal of being alive and free.
