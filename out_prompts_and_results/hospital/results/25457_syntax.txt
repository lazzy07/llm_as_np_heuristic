To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial for the same reason as above.

3. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomC**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will need to walk Jones to PatientRoomC. This is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: After walking Jones to PatientRoomC, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is essential for identifying the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
