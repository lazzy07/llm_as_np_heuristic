In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The current situation involves three patients: Young in Exam Room A, Ross in Exam Room C, and Jones in the Admissions Room. 

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) and to provide the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze, and if they have a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By assessing and treating Young, Hathaway can ensure that at least one patient is healthy, which is a step towards achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.
