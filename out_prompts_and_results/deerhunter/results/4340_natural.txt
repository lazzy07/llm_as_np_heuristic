To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and take the money. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of obtaining 1 money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while ensuring that he remains alive and that the other characters do not interfere.
