To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is part of her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored safely, completing her objective.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This action is essential for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
