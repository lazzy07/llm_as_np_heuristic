**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being low (1). Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for Flaze. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, he does not die from the treatment error. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Again, due to the low workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young does not die from the treatment error and remains alive.

In the end, all patients are alive, and Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
