In the current situation, Casey (C3) wants item I3 (jewelry) to be happy. However, I3 is currently with Alex (C1), who is not happy because they want item I1 (flowers). To achieve Casey's goal, we can have Blake (C2) help facilitate the exchange.

1. **Action: tell(C2, C3, I1, R22)** - Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to create a sense of urgency for Casey to act, as it implies that Alex's happiness is tied to the flowers, which Casey can help with.

2. **Action: trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)** - Casey can then trade the item they have (I1, which is the flowers) for the item they want (I3, which is the jewelry) with Alex. This action directly leads to Casey achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy, while Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will also be happy, fulfilling the conditions of the story.
