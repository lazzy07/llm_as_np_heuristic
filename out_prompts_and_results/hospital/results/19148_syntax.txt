To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway should assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room. This is necessary to provide him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Similar to Ross, Young is also in the admissions room and needs to be assessed to determine his symptoms.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room. This is necessary to provide him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

5. **Treat Jones in Exam Room C**: Since Jones is already in Exam Room C and has been assessed with SymptomA, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze) to ensure he becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: After admitting Ross and assessing him, Hathaway will treat him based on his symptoms. If he has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

7. **Treat Young in Exam Room C**: After admitting Young and assessing him, Hathaway will treat him based on his symptoms. If he has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
