To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory acquiring the treasure and ensuring he is not hungry. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory is in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, he increases his wealth, which is essential for achieving his goal.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the treasure, Rory travels back to the village. This is necessary for him to be in a location where he can interact with other characters and ensure he is not hungry.

3. **get_hungry(Rory)**: This action is included to illustrate that Rory can become hungry, but it is not necessary for achieving his goal. However, it sets up the next action.

4. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action is included to show that Rory's journey ends here, but it is not aligned with Rory achieving his goal. 

To ensure Rory achieves his goal, we need to adjust the actions to avoid him being eaten. Instead, we can have Rory propose to Talia, and they can get married, which will make them both happy. Here’s the revised story:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure, increasing his wealth.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with the treasure.

3. **propose(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory proposes to Talia, which is a step towards achieving happiness.

4. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal, leading to their happiness.

5. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married, which makes them both happy.

Now, Rory has achieved his goal of being happy and wealthy, and he is not hungry.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
