Talia, wanting to be happy and wealthy, realizes that she has the treasure but needs more wealth to achieve her goal. She decides to travel back to the cave to confront Gargax, the dragon, who is known to hoard wealth. 

1. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Talia to reach Gargax and negotiate for wealth.
2. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is included because Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, sees Talia as a means to satisfy his hunger. However, since Talia has the treasure, Gargax's action indirectly leads to Talia achieving her goal of wealth, as she is now part of Gargax's hoard.

In this story, Talia achieves her goal of wealth through the actions taken, even if it is not in the traditional sense of living.
