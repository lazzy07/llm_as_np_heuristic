To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Walk Young from Admissions to PatientRoomC**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will admit Young to PatientRoomC. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify the correct treatment for Young.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
