To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market and needs to move towards the Crossroads to reach the Cottage. This action is necessary for him to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom will walk to the Cottage. This final action will bring him to his desired location with the medicine.

The story is short and direct, focusing solely on Tom's actions to reach the Cottage with the medicine. The Bandit has already attacked the Merchant, which means the Merchant is no longer a threat, allowing Tom to move freely without concern for conflict.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the Cottage while carrying the medicine, fulfilling his goal efficiently.
