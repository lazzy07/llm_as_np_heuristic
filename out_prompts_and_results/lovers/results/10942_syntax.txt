To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3) and has it, while Alex wants the jewelry (I2) but is not happy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Blake (C2) for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2), making Blake happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is still not happy because they still want the jewelry (I3).
- Blake (C2) is now happy because they have the jewelry (I2).
- Casey (C3) is still happy because they have the chocolates (I2).

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

  "plan": [
    "trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)"
