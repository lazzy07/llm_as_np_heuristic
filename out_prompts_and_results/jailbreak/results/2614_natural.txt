**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows the bully believes he is in the laundry room, so he moves quickly through the hallway and crawls through the vents to the gym. Once inside the gym, he locks the door behind him to prevent the bully from escaping. 

With the bully trapped, Ernest confronts him. The bully, unaware of the danger, is caught off guard. Ernest, feeling threatened and wanting to ensure his survival, uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to kill the bully. 

With the bully dead, Ernest now feels safe. He exits the gym, still disguised, and makes his way to the highway. There, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
