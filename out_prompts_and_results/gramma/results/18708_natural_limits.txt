Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit nearby, also armed. Knowing that he needs to get back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take action. 

Tom approaches the bandit and, using his sword, he attacks and kills her. This action is necessary because it eliminates the threat posed by the bandit, allowing Tom to safely carry the medicine back to the cottage without fear of being robbed or attacked.
