Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to make his move. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife. He quickly crawls through the vents to the gym, where he finds the bully alone. With the element of surprise on his side, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Roy. 

Now that the bully is gone, Ernest can safely return to the hallway, where he can wait for Roy to finish his chores. Once Roy is done, they can escape together using the civilian clothes disguise.
