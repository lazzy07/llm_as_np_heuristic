To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he is greedy and has a loaded rifle.
2. **Go**: Bubba will go from the bank to the forest to find Bambi.
3. **Shoot**: Bubba will shoot Bambi in the forest, killing her.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.
   
2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba needs to move to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to reach Bambi for the next action.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can shoot Bambi, which fulfills the goal of Bambi being dead. 

By executing these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
