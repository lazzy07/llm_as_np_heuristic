**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A with Ross, who is also in the same room. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake. However, Hathaway decides to assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Given that Hathaway's workload is high, there is a chance of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy. The assessment reveals that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze with antibiotics. Since the treatment matches the symptoms, Ross becomes healthy.

At this point, Ross has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment. Despite the risk of misdiagnosis due to Hathaway's high workload, it is essential for Ross's health.
- **Treat Ross**: This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition. By administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze), Ross is cured and achieves his goal of being healthy.
