To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard while they are both in the Cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **Walk**: After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard will walk together from the Cave to the Surface. This action is necessary to ensure they are both in the same location and can continue to build their friendship.

3. **Begin Erupt**: Zoe will then begin the eruption of the volcano on the Surface. This action is strategic because it creates a sense of urgency for both characters to work together to ensure their safety.

4. **Walk**: Zoe and the Lizard will walk back to the Cave. This action is essential as it allows them to escape the danger of the erupting volcano.

5. **Erupt**: Finally, the volcano will erupt. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the Cave, they will be safe from the eruption, achieving Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe.
