**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomC**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis. This is crucial to understand the patient's condition and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment: steroids, room: PatientRoomC**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has Jarkis (as Hathaway has not assessed any symptoms yet), Hathaway treats Young with steroids. If Young actually has Jarkis, this will make them healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway now assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment for Ross.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, treatment: antibiotics, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Ross has Flaze (as Hathaway has not assessed any symptoms yet), Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, this will make him healthy.

**Final Explanation:**
The actions taken ensure that both Young and Ross are assessed and treated appropriately based on their symptoms. By treating Young with steroids and Ross with antibiotics, Hathaway aims to make both patients healthy, thus achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
