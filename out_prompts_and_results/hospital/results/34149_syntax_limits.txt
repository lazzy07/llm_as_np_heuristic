To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake in diagnosis. However, assessing Jones is necessary to determine his symptoms. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. If Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis, he will die. However, the goal is to treat Jones, and this action is essential for Hathaway to fulfill their objective of ensuring patient health.
