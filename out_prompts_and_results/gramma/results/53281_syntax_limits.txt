In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where she can take action to achieve her goal.

**Story Completion:**
1. The Bandit, who is currently at the Market, decides to rob Tom, who is also at the Market and is carrying a sword. Since Tom is armed, the Bandit cannot rob him directly. Instead, she will take a different approach.
2. The Bandit reports her location to the Guard, who is also at the Market. This action will draw the Guard's attention away from her, allowing her to act without being immediately threatened.
3. The Bandit then walks to the Merchant, who is at the Crossroads, and takes the coins from the Merchant, as the Merchant is unarmed and cannot defend herself.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **report(Bandit, location(Bandit), Market)**: This action is taken to distract the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit can operate without immediate threat.
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves to the Merchant's location to take the coins.
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins she desires.

  "plan": [

This plan allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins while navigating the constraints of the other characters' actions and statuses.
