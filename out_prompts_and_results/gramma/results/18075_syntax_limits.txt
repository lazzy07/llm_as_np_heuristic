To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, we can follow these actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action directly moves him to his desired location.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)**: After arriving at the Cottage, Tom needs to acquire the medicine from the Merchant. Since he has a coin, he can buy the medicine, fulfilling his goal of carrying it.

These two actions are sufficient to ensure that Tom ends up at the cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)**: This action is necessary for Tom to obtain the medicine he desires. He uses one of the coins he has to purchase it from the Merchant.
