**Story Completion:**

As the four characters stand at the crossroads, the merchant sees an opportunity. She approaches the bandit, who is armed and dangerous, but she knows that the bandit is also interested in coins. The merchant offers the bandit a deal: she will give her the hero's coin in exchange for the bandit's sword. The bandit, eager to have a coin, agrees to the trade.

With the bandit's sword now in her possession, the merchant feels more secure. She then walks to the market, where she can safely sell the sword for more coins. The guard, noticing the merchant's actions, decides to follow her to ensure that no criminal activity occurs.

The merchant successfully sells the sword at the market, gaining two coins. She now has achieved her goal of acquiring as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal.
