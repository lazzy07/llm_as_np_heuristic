Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, realizes that he needs to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms and provide the necessary treatment. With a workload of 3, he is at risk of making a mistake, so he decides to prioritize assessing the patients in the admissions room.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones, Ross, and Young, who are all waiting in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can assess him and provide treatment. This also increases his workload to 4, but he will assess the patients before treating them.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross as well. His workload increases to 5, but he will still assess before treating.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. He can now treat him appropriately.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Since Jones has a fever, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. 

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Since Ross has a rash, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, successfully making him healthy.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Since Young has a fever, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving his goal of ensuring they are healthy.
