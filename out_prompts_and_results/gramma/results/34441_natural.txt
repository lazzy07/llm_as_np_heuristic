To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the market where the merchant and the hero are located, allowing for potential interaction.

2. **The bandit robs the hero.**  
   - The bandit uses her sword to rob the hero, who is not armed. The bandit takes the hero's coin, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **The bandit walks back to the camp.**  
   - After successfully robbing the hero, the bandit returns to the camp to secure her loot and ensure she has the coins in her possession.

4. **The bandit puts the hero's coin in the chest.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit has coins stored in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.
