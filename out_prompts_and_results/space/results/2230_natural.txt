Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She knows that the Lizard is currently at the surface and is in danger. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and help him understand the danger they are both in. 

2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - By walking towards the Lizard, Zoe is showing her intention to communicate and make peace rather than fight. 

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, aligning with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends and be safe. 

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This final action ensures both characters are safe from the eruption, fulfilling their goals of being healthy and safe.

However, since the story requires a character to die, we can adjust the final action to have the Lizard stay behind to ensure Zoe's escape, leading to his demise in the eruption.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.
2. Zoe walks towards the Lizard.
3. Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.
4. The volcano erupts.
5. The Lizard dies in the eruption while Zoe escapes to the spaceship.
