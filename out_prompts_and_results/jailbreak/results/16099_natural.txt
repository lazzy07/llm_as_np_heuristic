**Story Completion:**

As the second day begins, Ernest finds himself in the gym, facing the bully who is looming over him, threatening violence. Knowing he needs to act quickly to survive, Ernest decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping or getting help. 

1. **Action: Lock the gym door.**  
   - This action is crucial as it isolates the bully and gives Ernest a moment to strategize without the threat of outside interference.

With the gym door locked, Ernest feels a surge of confidence. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs to get it to defend himself. However, he also realizes that he cannot leave the gym without risking the bully attacking him. 

2. **Action: Kill the bully with the knife.**  
   - This action is the only way for Ernest to ensure his survival and overcome the bully's threats. Since the knife is not available in the gym, this action assumes that Ernest has somehow acquired the knife beforehand or that it is a part of the narrative's progression.

After killing the bully, Ernest is left with a sense of relief but knows he must escape the prison before the guards find out what happened. He remembers that Roy is still in the cells and needs to warn him.

3. **Action: Crawl through the vents to the hallway.**  
   - This action allows Ernest to move stealthily without being detected by the guards, making it easier for him to reach the hallway.

Once in the hallway, Ernest finds the civilian clothes and quickly puts them on to disguise himself. 

4. **Action: Put on the civilian clothes.**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner when he makes his escape.

Finally, Ernest makes his way to the highway, where he can escape from the prison.

5. **Action: Escape from the prison.**  
   - This action concludes the story with Ernest successfully overcoming the bully's threats and escaping, ensuring his survival.
