In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry), which is currently with Casey (C2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to obtain the jewelry. 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade item I2 (chocolates) with Casey (C2) for item I1 (jewelry) in the living room (R21).

This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want while also giving Casey the chocolates they desire, thus making both characters happy.

After the trade, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy.
- Blake (C3) remains in the same position, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, Blake's happiness is not a priority in this scenario.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R21)"]
}
