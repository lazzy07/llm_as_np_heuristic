In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the chocolates (I3). Blake (C2) wants the flowers (I2) to be happy but is currently unhappy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I1) with Blake for the flowers (I2) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I1) while also helping Blake to achieve their happiness by giving them the jewelry they desire.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake will be happy because they have the flowers (I2).
- Casey will remain happy with the chocolates (I3).

This single action effectively ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
