Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He knows that Bambi is nearby in the forest and sees an opportunity. 

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and wants to eat, so he decides to shoot Bambi to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (After shooting Bambi, Bubba decides to eat the deer, fulfilling his hunger.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully killed Bambi and can now eat, but he still has not obtained any money. To achieve the goal of having money, Bubba needs to take a different action.

3. **Bubba goes to the bank.** (Bubba goes to the bank to confront the clerk and demand the money.)
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.)

Now, Bubba has both the money and has satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi.
