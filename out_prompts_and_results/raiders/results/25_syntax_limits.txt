After the events that transpired in Tanis, Indiana Jones finds himself back in the United States with the Ark of the Covenant in his possession. Knowing that the Ark is dangerous, he understands that he must ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands again, especially after witnessing the Nazis' disastrous attempt to open it.

To achieve his goal of ensuring the US Army has the Ark, Indiana decides to travel back to Tanis, where the US Army is currently stationed. He believes that the Army can secure the Ark and prevent any further misuse of its power.

1. **travel(Jones, USA, Tanis)**: Indiana travels back to Tanis to meet with the US Army. This action is necessary because he needs to be in the same location as the Army to hand over the Ark.

2. **give(Jones, Ark, USArmy, Tanis)**: Upon arriving in Tanis, Indiana gives the Ark to the US Army. This action is crucial as it fulfills Indiana's goal of ensuring the Ark is in safe hands.

With these two actions, Indiana successfully achieves his goal of having the US Army take possession of the Ark of the Covenant, ensuring it is protected from those who would misuse its power.
