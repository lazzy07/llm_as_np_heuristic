To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Currently, Alex is not happy, and they believe that the jewelry is in the dining room (R22). 

Since Casey is already happy with the chocolates (I3), we can focus on getting the jewelry to Alex. The simplest action to achieve this is for Blake to give the jewelry to Alex.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex in the dining room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
- Blake is still happy because they want Alex to be happy.
- Casey remains happy with the chocolates.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the action:
