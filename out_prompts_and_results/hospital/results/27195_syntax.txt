To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will also assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important for the same reason as assessing Ross.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also essential for Young's recovery.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones also receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
