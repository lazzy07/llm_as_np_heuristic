In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Blake needs to acquire the item they desire. 

Since Casey (C3) is in the same room (R22) and has the item Blake wants (I2), Blake can simply trade the item they have (I3) with Casey for the item they want (I2). This action will make both Blake and Casey happy, as they will each receive the item they desire.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **trade(c2, I3, c3, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I3) they have for the flowers (I2) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- Blake (C2) will be happy because they now have the flowers (I2).
- Casey (C3) will also be happy because they now have the chocolates (I3).

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(c2, I3, c3, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, achieving Blake's goal with a single action.
