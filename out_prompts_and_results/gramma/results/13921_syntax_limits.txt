In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has the opportunity to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. The Bandit can take advantage of the situation by robbing the Merchant, who is at the Market and is armed but not currently in the vicinity of the Bandit. 

However, since the Bandit is already at the Crossroads and the Merchant is at the Market, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **Walk from Crossroads to Bandit Camp**: The Bandit can walk to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest there.

This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to ensure that she has coins in her possession or in the chest at the Bandit Camp to achieve her goal. 

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the action taken:

1. **Walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest.

This single action allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in her possession.
