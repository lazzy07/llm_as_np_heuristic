In the current situation, Dr. Hathaway has a workload of 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake when assessing patients. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to assess Young to proceed with treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (due to the high workload), this treatment will be administered. If Young actually has Flaze, this will lead to a successful outcome. 

3. **Young becomes healthy.** This is the desired outcome for Young, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Young** is crucial to identify the symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment. Despite the risk of misdiagnosis, it is the only way to move forward.
- **Treating Young for Flaze** is the next step based on the assessment. If Young has Flaze, this treatment will cure them. If not, it could lead to a negative outcome, but the goal is to ensure Young's health.
- **Young becoming healthy** is the final outcome that fulfills their goal of being alive and healthy.
