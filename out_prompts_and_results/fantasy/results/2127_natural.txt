To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human and Rory is at the cave. By eating Rory, Gargax will satisfy their hunger and Rory will no longer be alive, which will allow Gargax to gain wealth from the treasure.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that is at the cave. This action fulfills Gargax's desire to be wealthy.

3. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince will travel to the cave to check on Talia and Rory. This action is necessary for Vince to be involved in the story and to potentially help Talia.

4. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince proposes to Talia, which is a necessary action to create a new relationship dynamic that could lead to happiness for Talia.

5. **Talia accepts the proposal**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which makes both of them happy.

6. **Talia and Vince get married**: This action solidifies their relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness increases.

7. **Vince picks up the money**: Vince picks up the money that he has at the village, which contributes to his wealth.

8. **Vince becomes wealthy**: With the money he has, Vince achieves his goal of not being hungry and being wealthy.

In this sequence, Rory's goal of being happy is not achieved because he is eaten, but he is no longer hungry. However, the focus is on Rory's actions leading to the outcome of the story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

    "Vince proposes to Talia",
    "Talia accepts the proposal",
    "Talia and Vince get married",
    "Vince picks up the money"
