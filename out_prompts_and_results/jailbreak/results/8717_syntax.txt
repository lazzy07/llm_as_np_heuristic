**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is aware that Roy has stolen the pack of cigarettes from the bully. He knows that this puts both of them in danger, as the bully is likely to retaliate. Meanwhile, Roy is in the hallway, contemplating his next move. 

**Action 1:** Roy decides to go to the laundry room to meet Ernest. This is important because they need to discuss their situation and plan their next steps together.

**Action 2:** Once in the laundry room, Roy tells Ernest about the cigarettes and suggests they need to escape before the bully finds out. They both agree that they need to get the knife from the kitchen to defend themselves if necessary.

**Action 3:** Roy then goes to the kitchen to steal the knife. This action is crucial because it gives them a means of protection against the bully.
