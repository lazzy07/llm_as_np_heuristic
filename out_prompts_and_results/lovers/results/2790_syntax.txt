To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake is not happy, and they want item I2, which is currently unknown to us. However, we know that Casey wants I2, and since Casey is in the same room as Blake, we can facilitate a trade.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that they want item I2. This is a necessary action to communicate their desire and to prompt Casey to consider trading.
   
2. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R22)**: Casey trades item I3 (which they currently have) for item I2 (which they want). This action is crucial as it allows both characters to achieve their goals: Casey gets I3, and Blake gets I2.

3. **put_down(C2, I3, R22)**: Casey puts down I3 in the room after the trade. This action is necessary to reflect the change in possession of the items.

4. **pick_up(C3, I2, R22)**: Blake picks up I2, which is now available in the room after the trade. This action is essential for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the item they wanted (I2).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **tell**: This action is used to inform Casey about Blake's desire for I2, which is essential for initiating the trade.
- **trade**: This action allows both characters to exchange items, fulfilling their respective wants and leading to Blake's happiness.
- **put_down**: This action is necessary to show that Casey has relinquished I3 after the trade.
- **pick_up**: This action allows Blake to acquire I2, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
