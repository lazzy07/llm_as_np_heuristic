To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is already assigned to Exam Room A, this action is valid. This step is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash), which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: After assessing Young, if Hathaway finds that Young has a fever (indicating Flaze), they will treat Young with antibiotics. This action is necessary to ensure that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway walks into Exam Room A and assesses Young. This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms, which is essential for determining the correct treatment. 

- **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: After assessing Young and confirming they have Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This action is critical as it directly leads to Young's recovery, ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all patients healthy.

By following these two actions, Hathaway successfully treats Young, and since Young is the only patient currently assigned to an exam room, this leads to the overall goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
