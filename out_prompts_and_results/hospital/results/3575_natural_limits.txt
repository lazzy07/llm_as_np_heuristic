Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. However, this treatment is incorrect for Jones, who actually has Flaze. Despite this, Jones's strong will to survive allows him to recover from the treatment, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B, where he can be assessed and treated later.
