**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of another patient.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the increased workload. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross does not have Flaze. Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's demise.

Afterward, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room A to assess Ross, but finds that Ross is no longer alive. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room B, where Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats Young with steroids. This treatment is incorrect, and Young also dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway, realizing the mistakes made due to the high workload, reflects on the situation, but it is too late for Ross and Young. However, Jones, who has been waiting in Admissions, is still alive and healthy, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.
