To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged, and she needs to secure wealth. The quickest way for Talia to achieve her goal is to marry Vince, who has money, and then she can take the money from him. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action makes both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness requirement.
2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action fulfills Talia's goal of being wealthy.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Vince) and wealthy (from taking the money), achieving her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve wealth, as she takes the money that Vince possesses.
