To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships with Rory and Vince, who have both proposed to her. Since Talia's happiness is tied to her relationships, we can have her accept one of the proposals and then marry that character. This will make her happy. 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling her desire to be happy.
   
2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to retrieve the treasure. This action is necessary for Rory to gain wealth, which can indirectly benefit Talia.

4. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy, which aligns with Talia's goal of wanting to be wealthy as well.

5. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary to bring the treasure back to Talia.

6. **give(Rory, Talia, Treasure, Village)**: Rory gives the treasure to Talia. This action ensures that Talia has the treasure, contributing to her wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Rory) and wealthy (from receiving the treasure).
