To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is important because it allows Casey to help Alex, even though it does not directly make Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the bedroom where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the crucial action that makes Alex happy because it fulfills their desire for the item they want.

5. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but shows Casey's willingness to support Blake.

6. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake moves back to the living room. This action is also not necessary for Alex's happiness but indicates that Blake is now free to support Casey.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
