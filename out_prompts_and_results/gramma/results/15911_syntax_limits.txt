In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The Merchant is currently at the Bandit Camp, and the Bandit is at the Market. The Merchant has a sword, which allows her to rob the Bandit, who is not armed with a sword. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Camp)**: The Merchant uses her sword to rob the Bandit, taking the coins from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as the Bandit is already a criminal.

This single action fulfills the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins while ensuring that she remains within the bounds of legality.
