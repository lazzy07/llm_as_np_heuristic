To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently in the Market with a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the bandit camp, which is part of her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step to increase the Bandit's coin count. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully rob him without any risk.
- **Walking to Camp**: This action is crucial for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in her possession.
