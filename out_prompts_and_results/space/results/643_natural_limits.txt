Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to her spaceship for safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to his guardianship of the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, teleports to the surface to confront Zoe. 

Once on the surface, the Lizard and Zoe find themselves in a tense standoff, but before they can fight, the volcano erupts violently. The eruption creates chaos, and in the midst of the disaster, Zoe and the Lizard are forced to work together to escape the lava flow. They help each other find shelter, and through this shared experience, they begin to understand each other's intentions. 

In the end, they realize that they both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. The eruption subsides, and they emerge from their hiding place, now allies rather than enemies.
