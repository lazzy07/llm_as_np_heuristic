The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is not armed, she decides to attack. The bandit swiftly strikes the hero down, killing him. With the hero now dead, the bandit loots the hero's sword and takes the remaining coin from him. 

Now, with the hero out of the way, the bandit can safely return to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins in the chest. She successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
