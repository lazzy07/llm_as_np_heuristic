To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the guard.** This action is necessary because the guard is armed and poses a threat to the bandit. By eliminating the guard, the bandit can secure the market area without interference.

2. **The bandit loots the guard's sword.** After defeating the guard, the bandit can take the guard's sword, which will provide her with more power and security in future encounters.

3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can store her coins safely.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. The bandit attacks the guard to eliminate the threat he poses. This is crucial for the bandit to operate freely in the market.
2. After defeating the guard, the bandit loots the guard's sword, which enhances her power and security.
3. The bandit then walks to the bandit camp, returning to her preferred location where she can safely store her loot.
4. Finally, the bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins secured.

The actions taken are necessary for the bandit to eliminate threats, enhance her capabilities, and secure her coins.
