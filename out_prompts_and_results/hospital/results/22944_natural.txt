**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a rash, correctly identifies that Jones has Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, they can treat Jones without making a mistake. 

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with steroids for Jarkis. This action is necessary because it directly addresses Jones's symptoms, ensuring that he becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess the other patients.

2. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. This action is necessary for Hathaway to check on Ross and Young, who are still in Admissions.

3. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

5. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids for Jarkis, assuming Young also has the same symptoms as Jones. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

At this point, both Jones and Young are healthy, and Hathaway has successfully treated both patients.
