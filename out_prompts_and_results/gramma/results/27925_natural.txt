To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to move to a location where she can potentially find more coins or interact with the guard.

2. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - The guard, being at the market, can now take action against the bandit, which is crucial for the merchant to avoid any criminal activity.

3. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit, allowing the merchant to safely collect the coins without being implicated in any criminal activity.

4. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant moves to the crossroads to loot the bandit’s coin from the chest, now that the bandit is dead.

5. **The merchant loots the coin from the bandit’s chest.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to acquire the coins without committing a crime, thus achieving her goal.
