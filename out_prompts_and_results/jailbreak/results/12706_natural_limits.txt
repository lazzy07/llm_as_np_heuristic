**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that the bully is still in the gym and that Ernest is in the laundry room, threatened by the bully's anger over the stolen cigarettes. Knowing that the bully is a danger to both of them, Roy decides to take action. 

Roy sneaks through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he finds the bully alone. With the knife he had previously seen in the kitchen, he takes the opportunity to confront the bully. In a swift move, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now safely return to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes to disguise himself further. He then makes his way to the highway, where he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
