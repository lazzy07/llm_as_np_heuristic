To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway should assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a rash, they will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. If they have a fever, they will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway should assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: This action treats Young based on the symptoms assessed.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, Admissions)**: This action treats Jones based on the symptoms assessed.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully treats both Young and Jones, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
