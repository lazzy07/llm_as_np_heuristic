To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. After eating, he can return to the bank to steal money from the clerk since he will have a loaded rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba travels back to the bank. This action is essential for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while holding the loaded rifle. This action is the culmination of his greed and the primary goal of the story.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act decisively.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
