Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment. With a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she knows that she must act quickly to help the patients.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and determine the correct treatment. 

2. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to assess Jones. This is crucial to understand Jones's condition and provide the right treatment.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess Ross. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Young for Flaze**: After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway determines that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. She treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making Young healthy.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway effectively assesses and treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients be healthy.
