To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. After that, he can go to the bank to steal money from the bank clerk since he is greedy and has a loaded rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and his desire to obtain money, fulfilling his goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
