To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to achieve their goal.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Casey to be in a different room.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by providing them with the item they desire.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: While this action does not directly contribute to Alex's happiness, it helps to maintain the narrative flow and allows Casey to be in a different location.
