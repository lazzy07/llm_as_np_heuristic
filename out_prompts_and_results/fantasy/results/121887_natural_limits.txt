In this story, Talia's happiness and wealth are the primary goals. To achieve this, we need to ensure that Talia acquires the treasure, which will make her wealthy and potentially happy. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** (Gargax is hungry and wants to eat a human. Vince is at the cave with the money, but Gargax is at the village. Gargax travels to the cave and eats Vince, which allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger.)

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body.** (After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This action increases Gargax's wealth but does not directly affect Talia's happiness or wealth.)

3. **Gargax travels to the village.** (Gargax now has the money and travels back to the village where Talia and Rory are.)

4. **Gargax eats Rory.** (Gargax is still hungry and now eats Rory, who is at the village. This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger again.)

5. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body.** (After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that Rory had. This action increases Gargax's wealth but does not directly affect Talia's happiness or wealth.)

6. **Gargax gives the treasure to Talia.** (Gargax, having no interest in happiness, decides to give the treasure to Talia, which makes her wealthy.)

7. **Talia becomes happy.** (With the treasure, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy, which in turn makes her happy.)
