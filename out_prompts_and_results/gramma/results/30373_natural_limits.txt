The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the cottage where Tom is currently located. Since Tom is unarmed and believes he is safe, the bandit can easily rob him. 

The bandit walks into the cottage and attacks Tom, who is unaware of the danger. With Tom defeated, the bandit loots the medicine from him. Now, the bandit has successfully acquired the medicine and can return to the bandit camp, where she can store her loot, including the coins in the chest.
