### Story Completion

After assessing Jones in PatientRoomA, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). To ensure Jones receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Jones with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis.

Next, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Hathaway admits Ross to PatientRoomB and assesses him. Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze (the fever). Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

Finally, Hathaway walks to the admissions room again to admit Young to PatientRoomC. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that Young is also showing symptoms of Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics as well.

By treating both Ross and Young correctly, Hathaway ensures that all patients are healthy.
