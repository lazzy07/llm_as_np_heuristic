To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action takes him directly to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because Tom's goal is to be at the cottage with the medicine. Since he is already at the Crossroads, walking to the Cottage is the only action needed to fulfill his objective.

After this action, Tom will be at the Cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
