Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and both are healthy but not safe. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, they need to find a way to escape the dangerous surface.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Since she is friends with the Lizard, she can invite the Lizard to join her.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface**: Zoe returns to the surface to help the Lizard escape. This action shows her commitment to their friendship and her desire to ensure the Lizard's safety.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave**: They both walk to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface. This action allows them to avoid the danger of the erupting volcano.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again**: This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they are both committed to helping each other stay safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave until the eruption is over**: This action ensures that they are safe from the eruption and allows them to bond further as friends.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
