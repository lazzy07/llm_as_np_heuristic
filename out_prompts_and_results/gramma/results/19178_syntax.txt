To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront Tom and the Merchant, as she needs to be in the same location to take action against them.

2. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying a coin. This action allows the Bandit to take one of Tom's coins, increasing her total.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This is necessary for her to return to her preferred location.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring her goal of having coins in the chest is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to be at the Market to interact with Tom. Walking to the Market is essential for her to execute her plan.
- Robbing Tom is a critical action because it allows the Bandit to gain coins without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the Merchant or the Guard, as Tom is already a criminal.
- Walking back to the Crossroads is necessary for the Bandit to return to her base of operations, where she can safely store her coins.
- Finally, taking the coins to the chest at the bandit camp fulfills her goal of having coins secured in her camp.
