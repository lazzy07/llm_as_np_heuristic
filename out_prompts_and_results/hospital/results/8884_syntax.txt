To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Jones's condition will help Hathaway decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will then assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in exam room A to confirm his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure Young receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This action is essential for Young to become healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy as well.

6. **Treat Ross**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy as well.

By following this sequence, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, and the other patients will also have the opportunity to recover.
