To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Casey is already happy with the chocolates (I1), we can focus on the interactions between Blake and Alex to facilitate this.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) to be closer to Alex and Blake.
   - This action is necessary to bring Casey into the same room as Alex and Blake, allowing for potential interactions.

2. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R21)**: Blake tells Alex that Casey wants the flowers (I2) while in the dining room (R21).
   - This action is a strategic lie by Blake to mislead Alex about Casey's desires, creating an opportunity for Blake to get the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) to find the flowers.
   - This action is necessary for Alex to leave the room and search for the flowers, which Blake has misled him about.

4. **pick_up(C2, I3, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I3) from the dining room (R21).
   - This action allows Blake to acquire the item they want, which is essential for their happiness.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey.
   - This action brings Blake to the same room as Alex and Casey, allowing for a potential conclusion to the story.

6. **give(C2, I3, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to themselves in the living room (R22).
   - This action is a formality to signify that Blake has successfully obtained the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to manipulate the situation so that Blake can obtain the jewelry while misleading Alex about Casey's desires. The movement and telling actions create a scenario where Alex is distracted, allowing Blake to achieve their goal without interference.
