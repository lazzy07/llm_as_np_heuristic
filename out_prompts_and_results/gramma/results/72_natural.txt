### Explanation of Actions

- **The Bandit Attacks the Merchant**: This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring the medicine. The merchant is the only character with the medicine, and since the bandit is armed while the merchant is not, this action is feasible and aligns with the bandit's goal of obtaining valuable items.

- **The Bandit Walks to the Bandit Camp**: After successfully stealing the medicine, the bandit needs to return to her camp to secure her loot. This action ensures that she can keep the medicine and any coins she may have, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having them in the chest at the bandit camp.
