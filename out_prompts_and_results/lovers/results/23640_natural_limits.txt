In the living room, Casey sees that both Alex and Blake are unhappy. Knowing that Alex wants the flowers and Blake wants the chocolates, Casey decides to take action to achieve their own happiness. 

Casey moves from the living room to the dining room to pick up the flowers. This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and the only way to achieve that is to ensure that Alex gets the flowers, which will make Alex happy. 

After picking up the flowers, Casey moves back to the living room and gives the flowers to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Alex's desire, making Alex happy. 

Now that Alex is happy, Casey can focus on their own happiness. Since Blake is still unhappy, Casey tells Blake that the chocolates are in the dining room, which is a lie, but it leads Blake to believe they can find the chocolates there. 

Blake, believing Casey, moves to the dining room to look for the chocolates, leaving Casey with the jewelry in the living room. 

Now, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry, having successfully navigated the situation to achieve their goal.
