To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the item they have (I3) with Casey (C3) for the item they want (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire while giving Casey the item they currently have.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have I1 (jewelry) and will be happy.
- Casey will have I3 (chocolates) and will still be unhappy, but since Alex's happiness is the goal, this is acceptable.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, which is the only way to make Alex happy.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
