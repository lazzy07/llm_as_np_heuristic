To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure his goal of having money. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry, and since Bambi is dead, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action confirms that Bambi is dead and satisfies Bubba's hunger.
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially take more money.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint**: Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can threaten the clerk and take the money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and he needs to address this need.
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This confirms Bambi's death and satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a logical step after deciding to eat.
- **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: This action is required for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money he desires.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint**: This is the final action that ensures Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and secured the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
