To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story can be completed with the following actions:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is located in the cave, and Vince needs to go there to acquire it. Since Vince has the money, he can also potentially negotiate or trade for the treasure.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which will increase his wealth. Since Talia is married to Vince, her happiness can be indirectly linked to his wealth. By acquiring the treasure, Vince can share it with Talia, thus contributing to her happiness.

After these actions, Talia will be happy because she is married to Vince, who is now wealthy due to the treasure he acquired.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the cave** is essential for Vince to access the treasure, which is the key to increasing wealth.
- **Picking up the treasure** directly increases Vince's wealth, which in turn can lead to Talia's happiness since they are married.
