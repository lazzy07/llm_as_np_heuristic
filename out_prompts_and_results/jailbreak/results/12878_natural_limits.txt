**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realizes that he has the upper hand. He grips the knife tightly, knowing that this is his chance to eliminate the threat once and for all. With the bully unaware of his intentions, Roy lunges forward and kills the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now safely escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then unlocks the gym door and makes his way to the hallway. Once in the hallway, he crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. 

Finally, wearing the civilian clothes, Roy steps onto the highway and escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
