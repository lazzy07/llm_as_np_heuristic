To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: This action is necessary because Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This will also increase Hathaway's workload to 4.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is in Exam Room A, this action is valid and necessary to identify the disease.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms. This is also necessary to identify the disease affecting Ross.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: After assessing Young and Ross, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify the disease affecting Jones.

5. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Young healthy.

6. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy.

7. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Jones healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
