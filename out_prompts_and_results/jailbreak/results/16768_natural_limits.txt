Ernest, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's survival. He has the knife, and the bully is a direct threat to them both. 

**Action:** Ernest kills the bully with the knife.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the immediate threat posed by the bully. By killing the bully, Ernest ensures that he and Roy are no longer in danger of being harmed. This action also allows Ernest to take control of the situation, as the bully can no longer threaten them.
