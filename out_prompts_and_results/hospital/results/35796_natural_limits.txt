Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Young in Patient Room A. Upon observing the rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis. Since Young is experiencing a rash, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the care he needs, as he is currently in Admissions and has not been assessed yet. 

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Assess Young in Patient Room A to identify the symptoms.
2. Treat Young with steroids to cure Jarkis.
3. Admit Ross to Patient Room C to ensure he receives care.

This sequence of actions ensures that Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of making all patients healthy.
