Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk.

1. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to threaten the clerk and take the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the clerk's money, which is his goal.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (After obtaining the money, Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any potential consequences.)

At the end of these actions, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted.
