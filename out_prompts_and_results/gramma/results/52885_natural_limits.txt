The bandit, realizing that the hero is at the cottage with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the cottage, where she confronts the hero. Since the bandit is armed with a sword and the hero is not, the bandit attacks and kills the hero. Afterward, the bandit loots the hero's corpse, taking the medicine. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit returns to the crossroads, satisfied that she has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she now has the medicine that could be valuable.
