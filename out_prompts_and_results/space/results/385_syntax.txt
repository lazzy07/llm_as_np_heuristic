To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. Since they are both on the surface and not fighting, this action is possible. By making peace, Zoe can establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which aligns with her goal of making friends.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is safe now that she has established a friendly relationship with the Lizard, and it allows her to explore the cave without fear of conflict.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to her spaceship. This action is necessary for her to ensure her safety, as the surface is still dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace**: This action is crucial as it transforms the relationship between Zoe and the Lizard from potentially hostile to friendly, allowing for cooperation and mutual safety.
- **walk**: This action allows Zoe to explore further and ensures she is not in immediate danger while she is still on the surface.
- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is essential for Zoe's safety, as it removes her from the dangerous environment of the surface where the volcano could erupt.
