To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and shot Bambi, which means he has killed an animal. However, he is still hungry and has a desire for money. The next logical step is for Bubba to eat Bambi, which will satisfy his hunger, and then he can return to the bank to get more money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and possibly feel more satisfied.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary for him to return to the bank where he can potentially get more money.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will decide to get money again. This action is necessary as it aligns with his goal of acquiring more money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the bank clerk again, using the rifle he has. This action is necessary because it allows him to take money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.

5. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will leave the bank and return to the forest. This action is necessary to conclude his actions after achieving his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Returns Bubba to the bank to pursue more money.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Aligns Bubba's actions with his goal of acquiring money.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk.
5. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Concludes Bubba's actions after achieving his goal.
