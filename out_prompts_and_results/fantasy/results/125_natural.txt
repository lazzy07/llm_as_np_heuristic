To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Vince travels to the cave.** (Vince wants to help Talia and has the money, which could be useful in the cave.)
2. **Vince picks up the treasure.** (The treasure is at the cave, and Vince wants to help Talia become wealthy.)
3. **Vince travels back to the village.** (Vince returns to Talia and Rory with the treasure.)
4. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.** (This action will make Talia wealthy, which is one of her goals.)
5. **Talia becomes happy.** (With the treasure, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy, which leads to her happiness.)

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia becomes wealthy and, consequently, happy. Each action is necessary to facilitate the transfer of the treasure from the cave to Talia, who is at the village.
