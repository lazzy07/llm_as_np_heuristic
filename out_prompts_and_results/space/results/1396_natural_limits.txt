Zoe, safe aboard her spaceship, watches the surface of the planet where the Lizard, her new friend, is in danger due to the erupting volcano. Understanding the urgency of the situation, Zoe decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard. 

Upon arriving, Zoe sees the Lizard struggling to find safety as the ground shakes and lava begins to flow. Zoe quickly approaches the Lizard and reassures him that they can escape together. The Lizard, realizing that Zoe is genuinely concerned for his safety, feels a bond of friendship strengthen between them. 

As they work together to find a safe path away from the volcano, the ground erupts violently, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption. Zoe, devastated but determined, teleports back to the ship to call for help, knowing that their friendship was forged in the face of danger.
