Hawkins, having successfully dug up the treasure, now stands before Silver, who is eyeing the gleaming gold and jewels. Knowing that Silver is a pirate who desires the treasure just as much as he does, Hawkins quickly devises a plan. He decides to take the treasure for himself, believing that Silver will not be able to stop him in time.
