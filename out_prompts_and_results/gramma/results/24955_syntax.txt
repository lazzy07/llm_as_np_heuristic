To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to leave the market and return to the cottage without being hindered by the other characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to head towards the cottage. This action is necessary for him to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom can now walk directly to the cottage. This action is essential as it brings him closer to his goal of being at the cottage.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary because Tom must leave the market where he currently is. He cannot achieve his goal of being at the cottage while he is still in the market.

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is the final step that takes Tom to his desired location, the cottage, where he will have the medicine he wants to carry.

Since there are no other characters taking actions that would interfere with Tom's journey to the cottage, these two actions are sufficient for him to achieve his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
