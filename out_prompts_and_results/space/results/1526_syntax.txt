Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, having made peace with each other. To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to ensure they both leave the dangerous surface before the volcano erupts. 

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to move to a safer location where they can continue to build their friendship without the immediate threat of the volcano.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures they are both in a safe location together.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, Zoe reaffirms their friendship in the cave. This action solidifies their bond and ensures that they are allies, which is important for both characters' goals.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety. This action is crucial as it removes her from the dangerous surface.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Cave, Ship)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship as well, ensuring its safety. This action is necessary for the Lizard to achieve its goal of being safe.

By following these actions, Zoe and the Lizard both achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
