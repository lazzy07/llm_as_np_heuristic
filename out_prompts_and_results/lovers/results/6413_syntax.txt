To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the room where Casey and Blake are. This is important for Alex to share their happiness with others.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to themselves (this is a way to signify that Alex is now happy with the item they wanted). This action is included to finalize Alex's happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is the item they wanted.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
