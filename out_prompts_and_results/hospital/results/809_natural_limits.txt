Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Young to an exam room. She assigns Young to Exam Room C, increasing her workload to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. She discovers that Ross is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Since her workload is still manageable, she correctly identifies the disease and treats Ross with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to check on the other patients, ensuring that all are accounted for and that she can continue to provide care.
