To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be treated for his condition.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room A. This allows Hathaway to treat Jones for his condition.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is already in Exam Room C. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.
