To achieve the goal of the Secret Agent, who wants the Mastermind to be dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Cache, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Cache to the Lobby. This is necessary because the Secret Agent needs to be in the same location as the Mastermind to carry out the next action.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Headquarters. This is where the Mastermind is believed to be located, and the Secret Agent needs to confront the Mastermind.

3. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind in the Headquarters. This action fulfills the Secret Agent's goal of ensuring the Mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that the Secret Agent can reach the Mastermind and eliminate them without any unnecessary steps. The actions are efficient and directly lead to the desired outcome.
