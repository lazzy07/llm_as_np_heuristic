In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the item I2, which is currently unknown to them. However, they know that Alex (C1) wants item I1, which is present in the same room (R22). Since Casey (C3) is already happy with item I3, Blake can help Alex by giving them the item they want, which will also make Blake happy if they can get I2 later.

To achieve this, Blake can give Alex the item I1, which is in the same room. This action will make Alex happy, and since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, this will fulfill Blake's goal as well.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the item I1 to Alex. This makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want.

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is necessary because it directly addresses Blake's goal of making Alex happy. By giving Alex the item they want, Blake fulfills their desire to see Alex happy, which is their primary goal.
