Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads, determined to return to the cottage. He knows that the merchant is at the market, and the guard is also there, but he has no way to defend himself against the bandit who is lurking nearby. 

To ensure his safe passage back to the cottage, Tom decides to report the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence, allowing the guard to take action against the bandit, thus ensuring Tom's safety.
