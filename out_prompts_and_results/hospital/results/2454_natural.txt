**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that there are still patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, this assessment is crucial to understand the situation better.

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room C. Again, Young's symptoms are unknown, but this assessment is necessary to gather more information.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing that the unknown symptoms could be Flaze. Since Jones is actually healthy, this treatment is unnecessary, but it is a risk that Hathaway must take to ensure all patients are treated.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, believing that the unknown symptoms could be Jarkis. This treatment is also unnecessary, but it is a risk that Hathaway must take.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has treated both patients, and since they were not actually sick, they remain alive and healthy.
