In the current situation, the Bandit is already in the Market, where she has just attacked Tom and is armed with a sword. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since she has just attacked Tom, she can loot him for the medicine he is carrying, which is not her goal but will help her in the immediate situation. 

The Bandit can then walk to the Bandit Camp, where she can place the coins she has in the chest. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit loots Tom for the medicine. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to take an item from Tom, who is now incapacitated after the attack. Although the medicine is not her goal, it is a valuable item that she can use or trade later.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for her to reach her preferred location where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for her to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "loot(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Market)",
    "walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)",
    "take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way for the Bandit to achieve her goal given the current situation.
