To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the Bandit prefers to be at the camp to achieve her goal.

2. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coin that she robbed from Tom and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has the coins secured in her possession, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to be in a location where she can store her coins safely.
- The Bandit takes the coin from Tom and places it in the chest, ensuring she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)",
    "take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to successfully achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
