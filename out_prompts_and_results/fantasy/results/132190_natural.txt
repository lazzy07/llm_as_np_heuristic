To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to obtain the treasure located in the cave. Since Gargax is already at the cave and the treasure is there, the simplest way for Gargax to achieve their goal is to pick up the treasure.

Here’s the completed story:

1. Gargax travels from the cave to the treasure (which is already at the cave).
2. Gargax picks up the treasure.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Traveling to the treasure**: This action is not necessary since Gargax is already at the cave where the treasure is located. Therefore, we can skip this action.
- **Picking up the treasure**: This action is essential as it allows Gargax to become wealthy, fulfilling their goal of wanting to be wealthy and not hungry.

Since Gargax is already not hungry, picking up the treasure is the only action needed to achieve their goal.
