The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the crossroads. Knowing that the hero is unarmed and has the medicine, the bandit decides to attack the hero. 

1. The bandit attacks the hero, successfully killing him and taking the medicine. 
2. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she has acquired.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she can now store the medicine and any potential loot from the hero.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Walk back to the bandit camp**: This action allows the bandit to secure her loot and coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
