**Story Completion:**

As day one progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway outside the prison. He knows that he needs to escape before the bully can threaten him or Ernest further. 

1. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Roy takes advantage of his disguise and makes a run for it, successfully escaping from the prison. This action is crucial as it allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free, away from the threats posed by the bully.

Meanwhile, Ernest remains in the cell block, threatened by the bully. However, since Roy has escaped, he can now focus on surviving until he can find a way out.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The only action taken in this story is Roy's escape. This is the most direct way for him to achieve his goal of being alive and free, as he is already in a position to do so with the civilian clothes disguise. The other actions, such as stealing or confronting the bully, would only increase the risk of being threatened or killed.
