After Hawkins spread the rumor about the treasure being buried on the island, he and Silver sailed to the island together. Once they arrived, Hawkins dug up the treasure, and since Silver believes the treasure is indeed there, he is unaware of Hawkins's true intentions. 

Now that the treasure is dug up and both characters are present, Hawkins takes the treasure for himself, achieving his goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **dig()**: This action was necessary for Hawkins to uncover the treasure, which is the first step towards achieving his goal.
2. **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: This action allows Hawkins to claim the treasure after it has been dug up, fulfilling his desire for the treasure.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
