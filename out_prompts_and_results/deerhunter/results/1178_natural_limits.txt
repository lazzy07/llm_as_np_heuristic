Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He goes from the bank to the forest where Bambi is. Bubba, with the rifle in hand, sees Bambi and decides to shoot. He loads the ammunition into the rifle and shoots Bambi, killing her. Bubba then eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger. With Bambi dead, he can take the money he desires.
