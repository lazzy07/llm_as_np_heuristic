To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the rifle and has already stolen it from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed level of 1, indicating he wants more money. The clerk has no money, and Bambi is alive in the forest, which is not directly relevant to Bubba's goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to potentially take any money he might have. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank, and Bubba needs to ensure he can take the money without interference.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will eat the clerk. This action is included because Bubba is hungry, and eating the clerk will satisfy his hunger. Although it may seem unusual, it is a way for Bubba to fulfill his need for food while also ensuring he has no witnesses to his actions.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money. This action is included to reflect Bubba's greed and his desire to have more money, even though he has already taken the clerk's life.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is the culmination of his greed and the goal he set out to achieve.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **shoot**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take control of the situation.
- **eat**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger and removes any evidence of his crime.
- **decide_to_get_money**: Reflects Bubba's ongoing greed and desire for wealth.
- **pickup**: Achieves the goal of obtaining money.
