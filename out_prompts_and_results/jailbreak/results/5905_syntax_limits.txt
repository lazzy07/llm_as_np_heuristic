**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest realizes that he needs to escape the prison to ensure his safety and to avoid the bully's threats. He knows that Roy has the pack of cigarettes, which the bully wants, and that they are both in danger. 

Ernest decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will allow him to blend in and escape without being recognized. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes in the kitchen, ensuring that he is not seen by the bully.

Once disguised, Ernest moves to the hallway. From there, he crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. With the disguise on, he can safely escape without being caught by the guards or the bully.
