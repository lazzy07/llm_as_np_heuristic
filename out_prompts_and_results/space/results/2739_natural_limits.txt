Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She teleports from the cave to the surface, where she finds the Lizard. Instead of attacking, she extends a hand of friendship, hoping to connect with the guardian of the planet. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions and the imminent danger of the volcano, accepts her offer of friendship. 

As they stand together, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. In the chaos, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and dies, but Zoe, having teleported to the surface, manages to escape back to her spaceship just in time.

This story ends with the Lizard dying due to the eruption, while Zoe and the Lizard made friends before the tragic event. The actions taken were necessary to achieve the goal of making friends and ensuring Zoe's safety.
