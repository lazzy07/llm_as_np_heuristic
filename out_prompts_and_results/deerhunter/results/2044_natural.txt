To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining the money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money without resistance.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to leave the bank after stealing the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk has the only money available.
- **Steal the money:** This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.
- **Go to the house:** This action is included to signify that Bubba has left the bank after achieving his goal, but it is not strictly necessary for the goal of having the money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to steal money",
    "steal money",
    "go from bank to house"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story. Bambi is already dead, so that condition is also satisfied.
