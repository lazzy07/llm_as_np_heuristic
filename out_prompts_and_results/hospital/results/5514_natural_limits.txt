Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients currently in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess their conditions. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young, who has just been assigned to Patient Room B.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to return to the admissions room to assess the other patients.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess their condition.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Jones.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B with steroids.** This action is necessary to treat Young, who is experiencing Unknown. Since Young is not actually experiencing Jarkis, this treatment is a mistake, but it is the only option available.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics.** This action is necessary to treat Jones, who is also experiencing Unknown. Since Jones is not actually experiencing Flaze, this treatment is also a mistake, but it is the only option available.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has done their best to treat the patients, but due to the unknown symptoms, the outcomes are uncertain. However, the goal of trying to make all patients healthy has been pursued.
