To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard take actions that lead to the volcano erupting, while also ensuring they become friends. The actions will be carefully chosen to achieve this outcome.

1. **Zoe and Lizard are in the Cave**: They are currently not fighting and have a friendly relationship (relationship level 1). This sets the stage for them to make peace and solidify their friendship.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Although they are already not fighting, this action will further strengthen their bond. This is important because it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

3. **Zoe walks to the Surface**: After making peace, Zoe decides to explore the surface, which is currently dangerous due to the volcano. This action is necessary to trigger the eruption.

4. **Lizard follows Zoe to the Surface**: The Lizard, wanting to ensure Zoe's safety and also explore, follows her to the surface. This keeps both characters together and allows for the volcano to erupt while they are present.

5. **The volcano erupts**: Since the volcano has been set to erupt, this action will lead to the death of one of the characters. In this case, we will assume Zoe is caught in the eruption.

The final sequence of actions will lead to the desired outcome of the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while also ensuring that the Lizard and Zoe have made peace and become friends before the eruption.
