To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because the merchant needs to be at the market to sell items and potentially acquire more coins.

2. **The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit needs to move to a location where she can interact with other characters or potentially rob them.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard is moving to the crossroads to maintain order and potentially confront the bandit.

4. **The bandit robs the merchant and takes the medicine.**  
   - The bandit, being armed, can rob the merchant who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to acquire the medicine, which is a valuable item.

5. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit returns to her camp with the stolen medicine, ensuring she has the item she desires.

6. **The merchant walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - The merchant returns to the cottage, where she can regroup and plan her next move.

7. **Tom walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - Tom is moving to the crossroads to check on the situation and see if he can find the merchant.

8. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom returns to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage.

In this sequence, Tom successfully ends up at the cottage, but he does not carry the medicine since it was taken by the bandit. However, the story can be adjusted to ensure Tom has the medicine by having the merchant give it to him before she leaves for the market.

Here’s the adjusted sequence of actions:

1. **The merchant gives the medicine to Tom.**  
   - This ensures Tom has the medicine before the merchant leaves.

2. **The merchant walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - The merchant needs to be at the market to sell items.

3. **The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit needs to move to a location where she can interact with other characters.

4. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard is moving to the crossroads to maintain order.

5. **Tom walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - Tom is moving to the crossroads to check on the situation.

6. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom returns to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine.

This sequence ensures that Tom achieves his goal effectively.
