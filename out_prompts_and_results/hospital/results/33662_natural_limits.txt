Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young is experiencing a fever, which indicates that Young has Flaze. This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine the correct treatment for Young.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk from Patient Room A to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to admit Jones and Ross for assessment. This action is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By assessing and treating Young correctly, Dr. Hathaway successfully helps one patient become healthy. The next step of admitting Jones and Ross will allow for further assessments and treatments, ensuring that Dr. Hathaway can work towards the health of all patients.
