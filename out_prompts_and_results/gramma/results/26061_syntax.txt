To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Crossroads)**: Tom will rob the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant's corpse. This action is necessary because the medicine is currently at the location of the dead merchant, and Tom needs it to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom will walk from the crossroads to the cottage. This action is essential for Tom to reach his desired location.

Now, let's break down the reasoning behind each action:

- **Robbing the Bandit**: Since the merchant is dead, Tom can take the medicine from her without any repercussions. This is the only way for Tom to obtain the medicine, which is crucial for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

- **Walking to the Cottage**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom must move to the cottage, which is his ultimate destination. This action completes his goal.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his objective.
