**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Given that Young is in Patient Room A, Dr. Hathaway checks for symptoms. Since Young has not shown any symptoms yet, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis due to the high workload. 

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Young is actually healthy, this treatment does not harm Young, and they remain healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross.

4. **Admit Jones to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C, increasing their workload to 2.

5. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Dr. Hathaway, still under the mistaken belief that Jones has Jarkis, treats Jones with steroids.

6. **Treat Jones in Patient Room C**: Since Jones is healthy, the treatment does not harm him, and he remains healthy.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross.

8. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing their workload to 2 again.

9. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids.

10. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Since Ross is healthy, the treatment does not harm him, and he remains healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
