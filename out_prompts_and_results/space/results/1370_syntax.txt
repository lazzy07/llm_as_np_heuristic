To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will reflect the characters' goals of safety and friendship, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano.

1. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action is necessary to initiate a conversation and potentially build a relationship. Since they are both on the surface, Zoe can approach the Lizard directly.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Since they are not fighting, they can establish a positive relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **Lizard begins to erupt the volcano**: The Lizard, now feeling a sense of friendship with Zoe, may decide to demonstrate the power of the volcano as a show of trust or to protect the planet. This action will lead to the eruption.

4. **Lizard erupts the volcano**: This action completes the eruption process, resulting in the volcano erupting fully.

5. **Zoe dies**: As a consequence of the eruption, Zoe is caught in the lava flow or ash, leading to her demise.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the Lizard and Zoe become friends before the eruption occurs.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "begin_erupt(Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Lizard, Surface)",
    "kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard to initiate a conversation.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **begin_erupt(Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard begins the eruption, showcasing its power and protecting the planet.
- **erupt(Lizard, Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the dangerous situation.
- **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe dies as a result of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story. 

This sequence ensures that all conditions are met while maintaining the integrity of the characters' goals.
