Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of Ross's condition. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, with the workload still manageable, Hathaway can proceed to treat Ross.

Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis, as the symptoms are still unknown. Fortunately, this treatment is appropriate, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action allows Hathaway to continue helping patients, ensuring that all are on the path to health.

In summary, the actions taken are necessary for Hathaway to manage the patients effectively and ensure their health, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
