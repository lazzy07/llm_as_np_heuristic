Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A, where Young is assigned. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Young. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway may mistakenly believe Young has Jarkis due to the high workload. This action is necessary to identify the disease and proceed with treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly impacts Young's health. If Young actually has Flaze, this treatment will lead to Young's death, but if he has Jarkis, he will become healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to manage the workload and ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated in the future.

In this scenario, the outcome hinges on the assessment and treatment of Young. If Young has Jarkis, he will be healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal. If he has Flaze, he will die, but Hathaway's workload will be reduced, allowing for better management of the remaining patients.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Young**: This is the first step to determine the correct treatment for Young, which is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
- **Treat Young**: This action is critical as it directly affects Young's health outcome. The treatment choice is based on the assessment, which is influenced by Hathaway's workload.
- **Admit Ross**: This action helps manage the workload and prepares for Ross's future assessment and treatment, ensuring that Hathaway can continue to work towards the goal of patient health.
