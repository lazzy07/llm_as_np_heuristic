To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can either die, become friends, or have the volcano erupt. Given the current situation, the best course of action is to have the volcano erupt while ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard can become friends before that happens. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard are currently in the same location and not fighting. This action allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. It also helps the Lizard feel safe and healthy, aligning with its goals.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. Since both characters are in the cave, they are safe from the eruption, but the surface becomes uninhabitable.

This sequence of actions achieves the goal of having the characters become friends while also allowing the volcano to erupt, which is a significant event in the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to overcome their initial distrust and establish a friendship, fulfilling both characters' desires for connection.
- **erupt**: This action fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt, which is a key event in the story. It also emphasizes the danger of the surface, reinforcing the need for the characters to stay in the cave.
