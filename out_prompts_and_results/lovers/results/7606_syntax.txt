To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not currently held by any character, and Casey wants I2 as well. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the jewelry, which is in the dining room.
2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room.
3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are.
4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire for the item.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to go to the dining room to access the jewelry.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the jewelry, which is necessary for Blake's happiness.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room to give the jewelry to Blake.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the item they want.
