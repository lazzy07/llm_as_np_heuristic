**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients quickly, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway moves to assess Ross in Patient Room C.

3. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Ross has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway moves to assess Young in Patient Room A.

6. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young.

7. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Young has Jarkis.

8. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although well-intentioned, lead to the deaths of all three patients due to her misdiagnosis caused by her high workload. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each assessment and treatment action is necessary to progress the story and show the consequences of Dr. Hathaway's high workload.
- The walking actions are necessary for Dr. Hathaway to move between the exam rooms to assess each patient.
- The misdiagnosis and subsequent treatments illustrate the impact of the workload on Dr. Hathaway's ability to correctly identify and treat the diseases.
