To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters and potentially sell items.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, leaving the Crossroads. This is important because it reduces the risk of the Bandit robbing or attacking the Merchant.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom moves to the Crossroads, where he can potentially interact with the Merchant.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard also moves to the Crossroads, which is important for maintaining order and preventing criminal activity.

5. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using one of the coins she has. This action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to acquire an item without engaging in criminal behavior.

6. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant returns to the Camp with the medicine, ensuring she is safe and can keep her coins.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired the medicine and retained her coins, achieving her goal without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's initial movement to the Crossroads allows her to interact with Tom and the Guard while avoiding the Bandit.
- The Bandit's movement to the Market reduces the threat to the Merchant, allowing her to operate freely.
- Tom's movement to the Crossroads allows him to sell the medicine to the Merchant, which is a key part of the Merchant's goal.
- The Guard's presence at the Crossroads helps maintain order and discourages any potential criminal actions.
- The Merchant's purchase of the medicine from Tom is the critical action that fulfills her goal of acquiring items without resorting to crime.
- Finally, the Merchant's return to the Camp ensures her safety and the preservation of her coins.
