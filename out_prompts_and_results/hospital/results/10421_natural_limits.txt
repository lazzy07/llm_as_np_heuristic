Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, is currently in Patient Room A with Jones, who is experiencing a rash. Since Dr. Hathaway has already assessed Jones and observed the rash, she knows that Jones has Jarkis and can treat him accordingly. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** This action is necessary because it directly addresses Jones's condition. Since Jarkis is treated with steroids, and Jones is experiencing a rash, this treatment will make Jones healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases by one, bringing it down to one. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Ross, who is currently in Admissions, can be assessed and treated next. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's condition is unknown, this assessment will help Dr. Hathaway understand how to treat him.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment.** If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids. If he shows symptoms of Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics. This action is crucial to ensure Ross's health.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that Young can be assessed and treated as well, following the same process as with Ross.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
