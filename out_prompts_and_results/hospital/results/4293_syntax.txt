To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 3, they will mistakenly believe Ross has Jarkis instead of Flaze. This is necessary to illustrate the potential for error due to the high workload.

2. **Treat Ross with steroids**: Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. This will lead to Ross's death since he actually has Flaze. This action is included to show the consequences of the doctor's mistake.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is in Admissions. Since Young has not been admitted to an exam room yet, this action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

4. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Assuming Young has Flaze, Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics, which will successfully make Young healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to PatientRoomA**: Jones will walk to PatientRoomA to be assessed by Hathaway.

6. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones, who is now in PatientRoomA. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2, they will correctly identify Jones's symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, successfully making Jones healthy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
