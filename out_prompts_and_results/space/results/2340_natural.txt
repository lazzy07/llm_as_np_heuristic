Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action is taken to seek shelter from the impending eruption. The cave is a safe location where both Zoe and the Lizard can avoid danger together.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they both remain safe and can continue their friendship in a secure environment.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace**: Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and commitment to helping each other. It emphasizes their mutual goal of safety and friendship.

4. **The volcano erupts**: This event occurs after they have reached the cave, ensuring that they are safe from the eruption. The eruption is a natural consequence of the setting, but since they are in the cave, they are unharmed.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
