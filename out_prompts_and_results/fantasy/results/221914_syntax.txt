To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already in a proposed relationship, and she has the treasure. The goal is to get married to Rory, which will make them both happy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action is crucial because it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through a loving relationship. Since Rory has accepted Talia's proposal, they can now marry, which will also make Rory happy.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: After getting married, Rory can travel back to the village. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness but can be seen as a step towards a new life together.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia follows Rory back to the village. This action signifies their unity as a married couple and allows them to start their new life together.

4. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Rory takes the money from Vince. This action is necessary for Rory to become wealthy, which aligns with Talia's goal of being wealthy as well.

5. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village. This action is included to remove Vince from the cave, ensuring he does not interfere with Talia and Rory's plans.

6. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to eliminate Vince, who is not aligned with Talia's goals and could potentially disrupt her happiness.

After these actions, Talia is married to Rory, which makes her happy, and they have the treasure, which contributes to their wealth.
