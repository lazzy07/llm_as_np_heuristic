To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit leaves the Market, which allows the Merchant to safely approach Tom without the threat of being robbed or attacked.

2. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks to the Market to retrieve the coins from Tom.

3. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, TomCoin, Market)**: The Merchant buys the coin from Tom, giving him the coin he already has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without committing a crime.

4. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks back to the Crossroads, ensuring she is away from the Market where the Bandit could return.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired one coin without engaging in any criminal activity.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit leaves the Market to prevent any immediate confrontation with Tom, allowing the Merchant to safely approach.
- The Merchant walks to the Market to interact with Tom and buy the coin.
- The Merchant buys the coin from Tom, which is a legal transaction that increases her coin count.
- The Merchant then walks back to the Crossroads, ensuring she is in a safe location away from potential threats.
