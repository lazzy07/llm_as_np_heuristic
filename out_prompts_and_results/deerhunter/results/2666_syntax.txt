To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to acquire the money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he is and head to the bank. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba confirms his greed and desire for money. This action solidifies his intention to keep the money he has just stolen.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten Bambi, to the bank where the money is located.

- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action reinforces Bubba's greed and confirms that he has successfully obtained the money.
