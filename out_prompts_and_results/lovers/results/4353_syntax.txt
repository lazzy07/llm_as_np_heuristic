To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R21) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) is in the dining room with the jewelry. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to finally obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey, who has the jewelry. Without this movement, Alex cannot interact with Casey.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is essential for Alex to receive the jewelry, which is the item they want. Once Alex has the jewelry, they will be happy.
