To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, the following actions will take place:

1. **Bribe(President, Villain, Money)**: The hero has stolen the money and is currently in possession of it. The villain, who has threatened the hero and coerced them into wanting the money to go to the villain, will now use the money to bribe the president. This action is crucial because it allows the villain to gain influence over the president by offering them money, which is a powerful motivator.

2. **Control(Villain, President)**: After the bribe, the villain successfully gains control over the president. This is the desired outcome of the story.

The actions are necessary to ensure that the villain can manipulate the president through the use of money, which is the only item in the story. The villain's control over the president is the ultimate goal, and the bribe is the means to achieve that.
