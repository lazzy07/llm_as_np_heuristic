1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Cottage to fulfill his goal of being there with the medicine.

This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal, as he already has the medicine after looting it from the Bandit.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. Since he is already at the Crossroads and has the medicine, walking to the Cottage is the final step to achieve his goal.
