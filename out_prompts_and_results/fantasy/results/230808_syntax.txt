To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness. Since Rory is currently in the cave and Talia is in the village, we can have Rory take the treasure from Gargax, who is also in the cave. This will make Rory wealthy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is a dragon and does not care about happiness, will eat Rory. This action is necessary because it allows Rory to be removed from the story, which is a requirement for him to achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry. 

2. **take(Vince, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: After Rory is eaten, Vince can take the treasure from Gargax's body. This action is necessary for Vince to acquire the treasure, which will make him wealthy.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince then travels back to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary for him to return to the village where Talia is.

4. **give(Vince, Treasure, Talia, Village)**: Vince gives the treasure to Talia. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, which will also make her happy.

5. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Finally, Talia and Vince can get married. This action is necessary for both characters to achieve happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **Gargax eats Rory**: This is necessary to remove Rory from the story, allowing the focus to shift to Vince and Talia.
- **Vince takes the treasure**: This is necessary for Vince to become wealthy.
- **Vince travels back to the village**: This is necessary for him to reunite with Talia.
- **Vince gives the treasure to Talia**: This is necessary for Talia to achieve wealth and happiness.
- **Talia and Vince marry**: This is necessary for both characters to achieve happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)",
    "take(Vince, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)",
    "travel(Vince, Cave, Village)",
    "give(Vince, Treasure, Talia, Village)",
    "marry(Talia, Vince, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, while also allowing Talia and Vince to find happiness together.
