Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A first. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A and assesses Young. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis. However, since Young is the only patient in Room A, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young for Flaze, assuming the fever is a possibility.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This is a risky move since Young's symptoms were unknown, but it is the only option available. Fortunately, Young does not have Flaze, and the treatment is successful, making Young healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room C to ensure he is also assessed and treated. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2.

4. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones, who is still waiting there.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Jones for Jarkis, assuming the rash is a possibility.

6. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. This treatment is successful, and Jones becomes healthy.

By the end of these actions, both Young and Jones are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
