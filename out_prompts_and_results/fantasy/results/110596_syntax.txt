To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory's happiness and wealth while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be closer to Talia, who has the treasure. This is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and potentially gain wealth.

2. **pickup(Rory, Money, Cave)**: Rory picks up the money that is in the cave. This action is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has the treasure, marrying her will make Rory happy and also secure a partnership that could lead to shared wealth.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Rory is aware of his hunger, but it is not detrimental to his goals since he has already secured wealth and happiness through marriage.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action is included to conclude the story, but it does not affect Rory's goals since he has already achieved happiness and wealth through his marriage to Talia.

In this story, Rory achieves his goals of happiness and wealth through marrying Talia, who possesses the treasure. The actions taken are necessary to ensure Rory's objectives are met before the conclusion of the story.
