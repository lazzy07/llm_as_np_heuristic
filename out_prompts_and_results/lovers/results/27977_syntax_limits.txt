To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). Since the current situation indicates that I2 is not in any room, we can assume it is in the bathroom (R12) based on the previous beliefs of the characters. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to pick up the chocolates, which are believed to be there.
2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates from the bathroom.
3. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake in the dining room.

After these actions, Blake will have the chocolates, making Blake happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to go to the bathroom to retrieve the chocolates, which is necessary for Blake's happiness.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the item that Blake wants.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: By giving the chocolates to Blake, we ensure that Blake achieves their goal of happiness.
