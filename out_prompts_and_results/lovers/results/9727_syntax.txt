To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) to find the item they want (I2).
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room.
3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R12) to give the jewelry to Blake.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C3).

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to go to the dining room to find the jewelry, which is necessary for Blake's happiness.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R22)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the jewelry, which is the item Blake wants.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey must return to the living room to give the jewelry to Blake.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: This final action ensures that Blake receives the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the item they want.
