In the cave, Talia and Rory discover the treasure. Talia, wanting to be wealthy, decides to pick up the treasure. Meanwhile, Gargax, who is at the village and hungry, travels to the cave. Once Gargax arrives, he sees Talia holding the treasure. Gargax, driven by his desire for wealth, eats Talia, taking the treasure for himself.

1. **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth, but it ultimately leads to her demise.
