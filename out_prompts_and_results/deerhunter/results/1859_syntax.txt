To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already at the bank and has loaded a rifle, he can use intimidation to achieve his goal. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and to take the money without resistance. This action is necessary because it ensures that Bubba can take the money without the clerk being able to defend themselves or call for help.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

- Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate the threat and ensure he can take the money without any resistance.
