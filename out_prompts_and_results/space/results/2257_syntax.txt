To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard is already in the cave, and it will walk to the surface. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard to the same location as Zoe, which is essential for the next steps.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once the Lizard is on the surface, Zoe and the Lizard can make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano can begin to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption that will lead to a character's demise.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts, which will kill any characters on the surface. Since both Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, this action will result in the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

The sequence of actions ensures that both characters achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano and the death of one character.
