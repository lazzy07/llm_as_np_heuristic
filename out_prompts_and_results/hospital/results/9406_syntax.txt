To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Since Hathaway is already in Exam Room C with Young, the next logical step is to assess Young to confirm the symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young based on the confirmed symptoms. Since Young has SymptomB, which we assume corresponds to Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids.

3. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will need to attend to the other patients. Therefore, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room A to ensure he is assessed and treated.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment according to his symptoms.

7. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B to ensure he is also assessed and treated.

8. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

9. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment according to his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomJ, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatmentJ, PatientRoomA)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomR, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatmentR, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

In this plan, "SymptomJ" and "SymptomR" represent the symptoms for Jones and Ross, respectively, which would be determined during their assessments. "treatmentJ" and "treatmentR" represent the appropriate treatments for their respective diseases.
