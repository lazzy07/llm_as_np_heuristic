To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he knows that the bank clerk is in the bank with money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal but provides a sense of closure and safety after the theft.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to reach the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his goal of acquiring money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest after successfully stealing the money.
