To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. Since we want Ross to be healthy, we will assume he has Flaze (fever) and will be treated with antibiotics.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones and Young, who are currently unassessed and in the Admissions room.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young is also treated correctly.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. Assuming Young has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids.

6. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics.

By following these steps, we ensure that Ross, Young, and Jones are all treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.
