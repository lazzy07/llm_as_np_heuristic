To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions in the cave where the treasure is located. Since she is currently in the cave and has no money or treasure, the best course of action is for her to pick up the treasure. This will make her wealthy, fulfilling her goal.
