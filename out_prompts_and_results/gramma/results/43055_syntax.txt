To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially find more coins or interact with the Merchant.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom moves to the Market, where he can interact with the Merchant and potentially buy items.
3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves back to the Crossroads, possibly to avoid the Bandit or to meet Tom.
4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads, where she can confront Tom.
5. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom also returns to the Crossroads, where he can interact with the Bandit.
6. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys a coin from Tom, increasing her coin count without committing a crime.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. The Bandit does not rob or attack anyone, and the Merchant successfully increases her wealth.
