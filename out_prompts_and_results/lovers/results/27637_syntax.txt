To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates, which are currently in the dining room.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary because Casey wants to have the chocolates, which will help in the next action.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item that they can potentially trade or use to make someone else happy.

5. **tell(C2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I1). This is necessary for Alex to understand what Blake wants, which will help in the next action.

6. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I1). This is necessary because the jewelry is located in the dining room.

7. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room. This is the final action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy.

8. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake after picking up the jewelry.

At this point, Alex has the jewelry (I1) and is happy. The story is complete with Alex achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I2, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C3, I2, C1, R22)",
    "tell(C2, C1, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Alex ends up with the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
