The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and looted the medicine, now seeks to maximize her coins. She knows that the guard is at the crossroads and is a threat to her plans. To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, she decides to take the following actions:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move away from the guard and create distance between them, as the guard is a threat to her safety and her coins.

2. **The bandit reports her location to the guard.**  
   - By reporting her location, the bandit can manipulate the guard into thinking she is compliant and not a threat. This action is strategic, as it may buy her time and keep the guard from pursuing her immediately.

3. **The bandit walks back to the market.**  
   - After reporting her location, the bandit returns to the market to retrieve the coins from the chest. This is essential for her to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

4. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to collect the coins she desires, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as she can.

5. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - Finally, the bandit moves to the crossroads with her coins, ensuring she is away from the market where the guard might still be looking for her.

By following these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
