To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary because Talia currently has no treasure, and acquiring it will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action is included because Rory is at the cave with Talia and Gargax. By eating Rory, Gargax will fulfill his desire to not be hungry, and it will also eliminate a potential obstacle for Talia in achieving her happiness and wealth.

3. **Talia's happiness increases.**  
   - After picking up the treasure, Talia's happiness will increase as she now has both wealth (from the treasure) and a sense of accomplishment.

4. **Talia travels back to the village.**  
   - This action is included to allow Talia to be in a location where she can enjoy her newfound wealth and possibly share it with Vince, further enhancing her happiness.

5. **Talia proposes to Vince.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to solidify her relationship with Vince, which will contribute to her happiness.

6. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that both characters are happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

7. **Talia and Vince get married.**  
   - This final action solidifies Talia's happiness through her relationship with Vince, completing her goal.
