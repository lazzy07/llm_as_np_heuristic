Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to satisfy both his hunger and his desire for money. He is in the forest, where he spots Bambi, the deer. 

To achieve his goal, Bubba takes the following action:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot Bambi, which allows him to eat the deer and satisfy his hunger.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Bubba's hunger while also allowing him to take advantage of the situation without needing to go back to the bank for money. By shooting Bambi, he can eat and fulfill his immediate need.
