**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure a pack of cigarettes. He knows that Roy is currently in the gym with the bully, who has threatened both of them. To protect himself and his friend, Ernest moves to the hallway to assess the situation.

In the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside with Roy. This action prevents the bully from threatening them further and gives them a chance to plan their next move without the bully's interference.
