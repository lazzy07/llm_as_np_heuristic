Tom is at the crossroads, carrying the medicine he just looted from the merchant. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, who has just robbed him of his coins. Knowing that the bandit is a criminal and poses a threat, Tom decides to take action to ensure his safety and achieve his goal of returning to the cottage with the medicine.

Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is still at the market. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence, allowing the guard to take action against the criminal. Since the guard is armed and prefers to eliminate criminals, he will likely pursue the bandit.

After reporting, Tom can safely walk back to the cottage with the medicine, as the guard will handle the bandit.

The actions taken are:
1. **report(Tom, Crossroads, Market)** - This action is necessary for Tom to ensure the bandit is dealt with, allowing him to safely return to the cottage.
