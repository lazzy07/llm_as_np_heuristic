To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to either give it to Casey or trade it.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey. This is important because it allows Casey to be happy, which in turn makes Blake happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be with Blake and receive the jewelry. This is necessary for Casey to be able to accept the jewelry from Blake.

4. **move(C3, R21, R11)**: Casey moves to the bedroom where Alex is located. This is important because Casey needs to be with Alex to help them achieve happiness.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R11)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex is happy because they now have the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, and Casey will also be happy because they have received the jewelry from Blake.
