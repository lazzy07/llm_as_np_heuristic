To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Bubba goes to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his desire to have money.

3. **Bubba goes to the forest.**  
   - This action is taken to confront Bambi, as Bubba may want to hunt her for food.

4. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - With the loaded rifle, Bubba can shoot Bambi, resulting in her death, which also fulfills the condition of the story.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, achieving both possible endings.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to access the clerk and the money.
- **Stealing the money** directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Going to the forest** positions Bubba to confront Bambi, who is a potential food source.
- **Shooting Bambi** results in her death, fulfilling the second condition of the story.
