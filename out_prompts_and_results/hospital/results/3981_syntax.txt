To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Jones in Exam Room A**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Hathaway to Exam Room C**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room C to assess the next patient, who is also Jones (as he was admitted to both Exam Room A and C). This is necessary to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Young in Exam Room C**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

6. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently waiting there. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated.

7. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room for assessment.

8. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

9. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
