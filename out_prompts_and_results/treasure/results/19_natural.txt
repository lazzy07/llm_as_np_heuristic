Hawkins stands on the island, treasure in hand, while Silver approaches, eyeing the gleaming gold. Silver, believing that Hawkins has the treasure, tries to negotiate with him. 

1. **Silver tries to persuade Hawkins to share the treasure.** - This action is necessary because Silver wants the treasure, and he believes that by negotiating, he might convince Hawkins to give him a portion of it.

2. **Hawkins refuses Silver's offer.** - Hawkins knows that if he shares the treasure, he may end up with nothing. This refusal is crucial to ensure that Hawkins retains the treasure.

3. **Silver, frustrated, threatens Hawkins.** - This action shows Silver's desperation and desire for the treasure, escalating the tension between the two characters.

4. **Hawkins stands firm and keeps the treasure.** - By maintaining his position, Hawkins ensures that he does not give in to Silver's threats, solidifying his hold on the treasure.

5. **Silver realizes he cannot take the treasure by force and decides to leave.** - This action concludes the conflict, allowing Hawkins to keep the treasure without further confrontation.

In the end, Hawkins successfully retains the treasure, having navigated the encounter with Silver.
