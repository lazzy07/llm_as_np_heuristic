To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, Hathaway will give him steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Young, who is currently there. This is important because Young is also a patient who needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
