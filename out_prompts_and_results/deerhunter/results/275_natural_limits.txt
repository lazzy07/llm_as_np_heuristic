Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He goes from the bank to the forest where Bambi is. Bubba, with the rifle in hand, sees Bambi and decides to shoot. He loads the ammunition into the rifle and shoots Bambi, killing her. Bubba then eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger. With Bambi dead, he can take her meat back to the bank, where he can sell it for money. However, since the goal is for Bubba to have money, he decides to go back to the bank with the meat to negotiate for money with the clerk.

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest.
2. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle and shoots Bambi**: This action allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of having money by obtaining food.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a secondary goal.
4. **Bubba goes back to the bank**: This action is necessary for Bubba to negotiate for money with the clerk.

However, to keep the story short and focused on achieving the goal of having money, we can simplify it to just two actions:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi.
2. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle and shoots Bambi**: This action allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of having money.

In this case, the story ends with Bubba having the potential to sell Bambi's meat for money, thus achieving his goal.
