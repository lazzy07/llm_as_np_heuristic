To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk at the bank.
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and steal the money.
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Deciding to steal the money**: This is a direct action towards achieving Bubba's goal of obtaining money. Since he is hungry and has no money, stealing is a logical choice.
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to steal the money. This action is essential for the next step.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the complete story with the actions:

1. Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.
2. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.
3. Bubba steals the money from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.
