**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A with Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, Hathaway decides to assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload. 

2. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis, but the treatment does not harm him since he is still alive.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to check on Ross and Young, who are still waiting.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B, where he can be assessed and treated next.

At this point, Jones is alive and healthy, having received treatment, even if it was not the correct one. The story ends with Jones achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition, even though it leads to a mistake due to Hathaway's workload.
- **Treat**: This action is crucial as it directly impacts Jones's health status. Despite the mistake, Jones remains alive.
- **Walk**: This action allows Hathaway to check on other patients, ensuring that the hospital's workflow continues.
- **Admit**: This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives attention and treatment, maintaining the hospital's operations.
