To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy with the item they have (I3). Blake (C2) has the jewelry (I1) but is not happy because they want the chocolates (I2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the chocolates (I2) that Alex (C1) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey (C3) will still have the flowers (I3) and will remain happy.

Now, Alex has achieved their goal of being happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: This action is crucial as it directly allows Alex to get the jewelry they desire, fulfilling their goal of happiness. It also ensures that Blake gets the item they want (chocolates), which aligns with their goal of making Alex happy.
