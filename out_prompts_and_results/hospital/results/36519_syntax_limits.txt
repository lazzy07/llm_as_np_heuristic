To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly. 

2. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with steroids if he shows symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). This action is crucial because it directly addresses Ross's health issue, ensuring he becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomC. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Jarkis or Flaze, which will inform the treatment decision. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake in diagnosis.

2. **Treat(Ross, Steroids)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Ross, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
