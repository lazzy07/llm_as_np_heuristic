Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she knows that Jones is the only patient she has assessed and that he has a fever. Therefore, she confidently treats Jones with antibiotics.

After treating Jones, he becomes healthy. Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced by one, bringing it down to 2. She then assesses Ross, who is still in the admissions room. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway is cautious but decides to treat him with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. However, this is a mistake because Ross's symptoms were never assessed.

Despite the mistake, Hathaway's primary goal of treating Jones successfully is achieved, and he is now healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, and treating him for Flaze will make him healthy, which is Hathaway's goal.
2. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to understand Ross's condition, but since his symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot treat him correctly.
3. **Treat Ross with steroids**: This action is taken to attempt to help Ross, but it is a mistake due to the lack of assessment. However, it does not affect Hathaway's primary goal of treating Jones.
