**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison comes to a close, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, stands in the hallway, contemplating his next move. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he has locked the door to keep him contained. With the knife still in the kitchen, he realizes he must act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety.

Ernest decides to crawl through the vents to the kitchen, where he retrieves the knife. He then returns to the hallway, where he can hear the bully's frustrated shouts from behind the locked gym door. With the knife in hand, he knows he has a chance to confront the bully if necessary.

However, instead of confronting the bully directly, Ernest takes a calculated risk. He unlocks the gym door, allowing the bully to come out. As the bully steps into the hallway, Ernest, still disguised, swiftly stabs the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten him or Roy. With the bully incapacitated, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison.

Ernest then makes his way to the highway, where he can finally put on the civilian clothes and escape from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
