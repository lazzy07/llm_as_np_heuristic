Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and friendship.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface. By moving to the cave, Zoe can ensure both she and the Lizard are out of immediate danger from the volcano.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they remain together and can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace**: Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and commitment to each other's safety and well-being.

4. **The volcano erupts**: This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have moved to the cave, ensuring they are safe from the eruption. The eruption serves as a reminder of the dangers they faced on the surface.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
