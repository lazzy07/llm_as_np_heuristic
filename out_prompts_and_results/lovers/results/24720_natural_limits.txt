In the current situation, Alex is in the bathroom with the jewelry, Blake is in the living room with the flowers, and Casey is also in the bathroom. Alex wants the flowers to be happy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action takes place:

1. **Casey gives the jewelry to Alex.** This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have the jewelry, which they believe they already possess. However, since Alex is not happy, this action does not directly help Alex achieve their goal of wanting the flowers. 

2. **Alex moves to the living room.** This action is necessary for Alex to reach Blake, who has the flowers. 

3. **Alex tells Blake that they want the flowers.** This action is necessary for Alex to express their desire directly to Blake, who can then respond accordingly.
