To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with Blake and potentially trade items.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room. This allows both Casey and Blake to be in the same room, facilitating a trade.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Blake has. This is crucial because it allows Casey to give Blake the item they want, which is the chocolates, while Blake gives Casey the flowers that Alex wants.

4. **move(C2, R21, R11)**: Casey moves back to the bedroom where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to deliver the flowers to Alex.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R11)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the flowers they wanted.
