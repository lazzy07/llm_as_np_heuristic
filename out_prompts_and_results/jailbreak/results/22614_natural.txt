**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that the bully is still in the gym, believing both he and Roy are in the kitchen. 

1. **Ernest moves to the highway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to be in a position to escape.)
2. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the civilian clothes on the highway, this action allows Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the kitchen with the cigarettes, is unaware of Ernest's escape. He decides to keep the cigarettes hidden from the bully, hoping to use them as leverage later.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's movement to the highway is crucial as it sets him up for escape. 
- Escaping while disguised ensures that he is no longer threatened by the bully or the prison guards, fulfilling his desire to be alive and free.
