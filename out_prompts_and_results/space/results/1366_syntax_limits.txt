Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, both feeling safe and healthy. However, Zoe knows that the volcano on the surface is dangerous and could erupt at any moment. She wants to make friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet, but their relationship is currently strained. 

To improve their relationship, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy and safe and to make friends. By making peace, they can establish a bond that may help them work together in the future.

After making peace, the volcano suddenly erupts. This action is inevitable given the current situation, and it leads to the demise of one character. Since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she is caught in the eruption and dies.
