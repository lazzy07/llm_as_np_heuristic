To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it removes one of the humans from the cave, allowing Talia to take the money from Vince's dead body, which will increase her wealth.

2. **Talia takes the money from Vince's body**: After Vince is eaten by Gargax, Talia can take the money from Vince's body. This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy.

3. **Talia's happiness increases**: Since Talia now has both the treasure and the money, her wealth increases, and she feels a sense of accomplishment and happiness from achieving her goals.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- Gargax eats Vince: This action eliminates a competitor for wealth and satisfies Gargax's hunger.
- Talia takes the money from Vince's body: This action directly increases Talia's wealth, helping her achieve her goal of being wealthy.
- Talia's happiness increases: This is the result of Talia achieving her goals of wealth and happiness.
