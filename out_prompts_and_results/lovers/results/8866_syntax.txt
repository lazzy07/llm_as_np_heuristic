To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Alex will still be unhappy because they want the flowers (I1), but that is not the focus of this story.
- Blake remains unhappy as well, but again, the focus is on Casey's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be able to interact with Alex, who is in the dining room.
- **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: This action is the key to making Casey happy, as it provides them with the item they desire.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:
