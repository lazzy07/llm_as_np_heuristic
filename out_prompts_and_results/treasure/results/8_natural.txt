Hawkins stands triumphantly over the freshly dug hole, the treasure glinting in the sunlight. Silver, still believing that Hawkins has the treasure, approaches him with a mix of admiration and greed. 

Hawkins, knowing that Silver is a pirate and might try to take the treasure by force, decides to play it smart. He offers Silver a deal: they can share the treasure if Silver helps him get it back to the port safely. Silver, intrigued by the prospect of a partnership and the treasure, agrees.

Together, they sail back to Port Royal, where Hawkins keeps a close eye on the treasure. Once they arrive, Hawkins cleverly suggests that they should hide the treasure in a safe place before revealing it to anyone else. Silver, eager to keep the treasure secure, agrees to this plan.

Once they have hidden the treasure, Hawkins, feeling secure in his possession, reveals that he has no intention of sharing it. He quickly takes the treasure for himself and leaves Silver behind, having outsmarted the pirate.
