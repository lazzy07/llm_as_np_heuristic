1. The merchant, seeing that the guard is present and wanting to avoid any criminal activity, decides to take advantage of the situation. She reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is taken because the merchant wants to ensure her safety and gain favor with the guard, which could lead to more business opportunities in the future.

3. The guard arrives at the cottage and attacks the bandit, killing her. This action is taken to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit, which aligns with the guard's goal.

4. After the bandit is defeated, the guard loots the bandit's corpse and takes the coins from the chest. This action allows the guard to collect evidence of the bandit's crimes and potentially redistribute the wealth.
