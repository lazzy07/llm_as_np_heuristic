Zoe, the space explorer, realizes that the Lizard is on the surface and is in danger due to the erupting volcano. She decides to teleport down to the surface to help the Lizard, hoping to make a friend and ensure both of their safety.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface to reach the Lizard and offer assistance.

Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and sees that it is frightened and in danger from the volcano. She decides to make peace with the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which allows them to become friends. This action ensures that both characters can work together to find safety.

Now that they are friends, Zoe and the Lizard can collaborate to escape the danger posed by the volcano.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave, which is a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
