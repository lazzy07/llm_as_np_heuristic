Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both recognize the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface and decide to work together to ensure their safety. Zoe suggests that they explore the cave further to find a safe place away from the danger of the volcano. The Lizard agrees, and they both walk deeper into the cave, away from the surface.

As they explore, they discover a hidden chamber filled with glowing crystals that provide a warm light. They realize that this chamber can serve as a safe haven for both of them. In this moment of discovery, they solidify their friendship, knowing they can rely on each other for safety and companionship.

However, unbeknownst to them, the volcano erupts violently, sending shockwaves through the planet. The cave begins to tremble, and rocks start to fall. Zoe and the Lizard quickly realize they need to escape the cave before it collapses. They rush towards the exit, but a large boulder falls, blocking Zoe's path. The Lizard, seeing Zoe in danger, uses its strength to push the boulder aside, allowing Zoe to escape just in time. 

In the chaos, the Lizard is injured by falling debris, but Zoe manages to pull the Lizard to safety outside the cave. They both make it out, but the Lizard is gravely hurt. Despite the injury, they are grateful to have each other as friends, having faced danger together.
