1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom, who has just robbed her and is carrying her coin.

2. **report(Merchant, location(Tom), Market)**: The Merchant reports Tom's location to the Guard, which is a strategic move to ensure that Tom, who is now a criminal, is dealt with. This action does not make her a criminal and helps her maintain her status.

3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads to confront Tom based on the Merchant's report.
