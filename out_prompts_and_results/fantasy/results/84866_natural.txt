1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to bring the money he has to the cave, where the treasure is located. 

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which is essential for Rory's goal of being wealthy.

3. **Vince gives the treasure to Rory.**

4. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure now in Rory's possession, Rory's wealth increases, leading to happiness.
