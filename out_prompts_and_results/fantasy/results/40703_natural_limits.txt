To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that will allow her to gain the treasure that Rory had, as well as ensuring her happiness through her relationship with Vince.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** (This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and wants to eat a human. By eating Talia, Gargax will fulfill his hunger, and Talia will no longer be alive, which will allow her to be happy in the afterlife, as she is married to Rory and Vince.)
   
2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body.** (This action allows Gargax to gain wealth, but it also indirectly benefits Talia, as she is now free from her struggles in life and can be considered happy in her relationships with Rory and Vince.)

In this scenario, Talia's happiness is achieved through her relationships, even though she is no longer alive. The actions taken are necessary to fulfill the characters' desires while ensuring Talia's ultimate happiness.
