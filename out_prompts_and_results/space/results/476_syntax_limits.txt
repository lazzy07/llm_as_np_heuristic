Zoe, realizing the danger of the volcano on the surface, decides to teleport back to the ship to assess the situation. However, she knows that the Lizard is on the surface and may be in danger. After teleporting to the ship, she quickly teleports back to the surface to warn the Lizard. 

Upon her arrival, she finds the Lizard in the cave, and they both realize that the volcano is about to erupt. Instead of fighting, they decide to work together to escape the danger.
