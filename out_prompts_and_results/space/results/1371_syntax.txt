To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are not fighting, this action can succeed.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is necessary to explore the cave, which may provide a safe haven from the dangers of the surface, especially if the volcano erupts.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will begin to erupt. This action is included to create a sense of urgency and danger, emphasizing the need for Zoe to find safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is already in the cave, she is safe. This action highlights the danger of the surface and reinforces the importance of Zoe's earlier decision to move to the cave.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
