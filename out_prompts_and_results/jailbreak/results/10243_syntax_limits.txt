**Story Completion:**

After venting into the gym, Ernest finds himself face-to-face with the bully, who is still in the gym. Knowing that he is threatened and that the bully has been a constant source of fear, Ernest decides to take action. He pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen and confronts the bully. In a moment of desperation and determination to survive, Ernest kills the bully.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He quickly checks the surroundings to ensure no guards are nearby. He then decides to leave the gym and head to the laundry room where Roy is still working. Once there, he tells Roy about what happened and they both quickly put on the civilian clothes. 

Now disguised, they make their way to the hallway and crawl through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once they reach the highway, they escape from the prison, finally free from the threats that loomed over them.
