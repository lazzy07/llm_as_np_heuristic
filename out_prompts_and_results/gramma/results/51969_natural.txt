To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** The bandit is armed and can rob the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant, which is a valuable item that can be sold or used later.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, the bandit camp, where she can store her coins and the medicine.

3. **The bandit places the hero's coin and the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action ensures that the bandit has successfully secured her coins and the medicine, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
