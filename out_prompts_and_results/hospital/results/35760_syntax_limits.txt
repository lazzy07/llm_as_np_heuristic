**Story Completion:**

After walking into Exam Room B, Jones looks at Hathaway, who is busy assessing Young. Jones feels a bit anxious but knows he needs to be checked. 

1. **Assess (Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway turns her attention to Jones and assesses him. She finds that he has a fever, indicating he might have Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Jones's condition accurately.

2. **Treat (Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

With the treatment administered, Jones feels the fever subsiding and knows he is on the path to recovery. He is grateful to Hathaway for her quick actions.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (assessing Jones) is essential for Hathaway to identify the correct disease based on symptoms. Since Jones has a fever, it indicates Flaze.
- The second action (treating Jones with antibiotics) is necessary to ensure that Jones recovers from his illness. Since Hathaway's workload is still low (1), she does not make a mistake in diagnosing or treating him.
