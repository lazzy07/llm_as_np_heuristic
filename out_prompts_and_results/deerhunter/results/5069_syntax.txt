To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and some ammunition, and he has already shot Bambi, which means he can eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants to get more money. The bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, and Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the clerk while he has the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and focus on his next actions.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire for money.
