To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **bribe(Villain, President, Money)**: The villain uses the money to bribe the president. This action is crucial because it allows the villain to gain control over the president by leveraging the money as a means of influence.

2. **coerce(Villain, Hero, Money)**: The villain then coerces the hero into wanting the president to have the money. Since the hero fears the villain, this action is effective in manipulating the hero's desires to align with the villain's goals.

With these two actions, the villain successfully controls the president, achieving the desired outcome.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bribe**: This action is necessary for the villain to gain direct control over the president, as it creates a dependency on the villain for financial support or favors.
- **Coerce**: This action ensures that the hero, who is in a position to oppose the villain, is manipulated into supporting the villain's control over the president, further solidifying the villain's power.
