To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is to ensure that Alex is with the other characters after obtaining the jewelry.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3). This action is important because Casey wants the item that Alex has, and by giving it to Casey, Alex can help ensure that Casey is happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want. This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their own happiness.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This is essential for Blake to obtain the item they desire.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey.

8. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is important because it helps Alex achieve their happiness by receiving the item they want.

After these actions, the happiness of the characters is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey is happy because they received the jewelry (I1) from Alex.
- Blake is happy because they have the chocolates (I2).

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of being happy.
