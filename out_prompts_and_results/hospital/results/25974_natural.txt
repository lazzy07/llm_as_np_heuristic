**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess Ross to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is taken to treat Ross. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. However, the goal is to ensure that at least one patient is treated correctly.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated appropriately.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway believes Young has Jarkis, this action is taken to treat Young. If Young actually has Jarkis, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. Again, the goal is to ensure that at least one patient is treated correctly.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway believes Jones has Jarkis, this action is taken to treat Jones. If Jones actually has Jarkis, he will become healthy; if not, he will die.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients, which is necessary for achieving the goal of having all patients healthy. The assessments are crucial to identify the diseases, and the treatments are necessary to cure the patients. The risk of mistakes due to high workload is acknowledged, but the actions are still taken to maximize the chances of at least some patients becoming healthy.
