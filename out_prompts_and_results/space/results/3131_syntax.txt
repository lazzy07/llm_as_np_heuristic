To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are already in a non-fighting state and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial for both characters to feel safe and healthy, as it fosters cooperation rather than conflict.

2. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: After making peace, Zoe can teleport to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the impending volcanic eruption. This action is necessary for her to avoid danger while still maintaining a friendly relationship with the Lizard.

3. **Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard can then walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the surface where the volcano is about to erupt. This action helps the Lizard to stay safe and healthy.

4. **Erupt the volcano**: Finally, the volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are in safe locations (Zoe in the spaceship and Lizard in the cave), they remain unharmed. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by both characters.

The sequence of actions ensures that both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship while avoiding the danger posed by the erupting volcano.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
