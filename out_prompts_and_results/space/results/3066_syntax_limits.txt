Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have established a friendly relationship, but the situation is dire. To ensure their safety and to solidify their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

Zoe teleports from the surface of the planet to her spaceship. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous due to the volcano, and by moving to the spaceship, she can ensure her safety.
