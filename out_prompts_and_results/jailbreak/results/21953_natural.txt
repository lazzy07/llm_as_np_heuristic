**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that the bully is still in the gym, believing both he and Roy are in the kitchen. 

1. **Ernest moves from the highway to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to the exit of the prison.)
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to avoid detection and get closer to the bully.)
3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, he prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him without interference.)
4. **Ernest takes the knife from his pocket.** (This is essential for him to defend himself and take control of the situation.)
5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, allowing Ernest to feel safe.)
6. **Ernest then returns to the hallway.** (He needs to get back to the highway to escape.)
7. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes again if needed.** (He is already disguised, but this ensures he is ready for the escape.)
8. **Ernest moves to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

With the bully out of the way, Ernest feels secure and makes his way to the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
