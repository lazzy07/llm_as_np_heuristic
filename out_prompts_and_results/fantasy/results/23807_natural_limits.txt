Gargax, having just eaten both Vince and Talia, now feels a sense of urgency to satisfy his hunger and achieve his goal of wealth. He knows that the treasure is located in the cave, and since he is already at the village, he decides to travel back to the cave to claim the treasure.

**Action: Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**

This action is necessary because Gargax needs to reach the location where the treasure is stored in order to become wealthy. By traveling to the cave, he can fulfill his goal of acquiring wealth without any further complications.

After this action, Gargax will be at the cave, where he can pick up the treasure in the next step, thus achieving his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
