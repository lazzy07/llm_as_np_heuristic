**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to assess Ross, who is assigned to this room. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, this action is necessary to understand Ross's condition better.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he might have Flaze due to the unknown symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, he does not make a mistake in this instance. Ross receives the treatment and becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting there.

4. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B, increasing his workload to 2 again.

5. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones.

6. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease.

7. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he might have Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still 2, he does not make a mistake. Jones receives the treatment and becomes healthy.

8. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young.

9. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing his workload to 2.

10. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young.

11. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. 

12. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he might have Flaze. Young receives the treatment and becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Ross, Jones, and Young—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

- Treating each patient with antibiotics is a necessary action to ensure they recover, even if the doctor is unsure of their exact disease.
- Walking between rooms is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to perform assessments and treatments, as he must be in the same room as the patient to do so.
- Admitting patients is essential to ensure they are assigned to the correct exam rooms for treatment.
