Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, is currently at Patient Room A with Jones, who is experiencing a fever. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat another patient. 

To ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment for his fever, Hathaway decides to treat Jones immediately. This action will reduce Hathaway's workload by one and, since Jones has a fever, the treatment of antibiotics will make him healthy.

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload is now 2. Jones is now healthy, which fulfills Hathaway's goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.

Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Ross and Young, who are both still waiting. Since Ross is in Admissions and has an unknown condition, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. 

After assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that he is also experiencing a fever. Hathaway can now treat Ross with antibiotics, making him healthy as well. 

Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in Admissions. Since Young's condition is unknown, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. If Young is found to have a fever, he can also be treated with antibiotics.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
