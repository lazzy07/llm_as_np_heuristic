To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can outline the following actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R11)**: Casey (C3) can trade the item they have (the jewelry, I3) with Alex (C2) for the flowers (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and Alex is currently holding it.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R11)**: After the trade, Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is necessary for Casey to finally obtain the item they want.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they will have the jewelry they desire.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action allows Casey to exchange the item they have (which is not specified but can be assumed to be something less desirable) for the jewelry that they want. This is a strategic move to ensure that Casey can get what they desire.
- The give action is the final step where the jewelry is transferred to Casey, fulfilling their goal of happiness.
