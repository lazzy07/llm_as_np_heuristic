To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will need to admit Ross to an exam room first. However, since Hathaway's workload is already at 2, they can only assess Young in PatientRoomA. We will first assess Young to confirm their symptoms.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. Since Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis, Hathaway will treat Young with steroids.

3. **Walk Jones to Exam Room B**: After treating Young, Hathaway will need to admit Jones to an exam room. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will walk Jones to Exam Room B.

4. **Assess Jones**: Once Jones is in Exam Room B, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

5. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms.

6. **Walk Ross to Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will walk Ross from the admissions room to Exam Room C.

7. **Assess Ross**: Once Ross is in Exam Room C, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms.

8. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
