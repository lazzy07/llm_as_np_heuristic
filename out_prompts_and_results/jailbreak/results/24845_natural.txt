As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway, feeling a sense of urgency to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the laundry room, threatened by the bully. 

1. **Roy decides to escape from the prison.** Since he is already on the highway and wearing the civilian clothes, he can successfully leave the prison without being detected. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Roy achieving his goal of being alive and free.

2. **Meanwhile, Ernest remains in the laundry room, unaware of Roy's escape.** He is still threatened by the bully, who is in the gym, but he has completed his chores and is waiting for an opportunity to either defend himself or escape.

**Explanation of Actions:**
