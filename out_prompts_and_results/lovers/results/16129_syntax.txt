To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where Casey is currently located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but can be included for narrative flow.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey. This action is included to show that Blake is supportive and wants to be around Alex.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) to join Alex and Blake. This action helps to create a sense of togetherness among the characters.

At this point, Alex has received the jewelry and is happy. The other characters may still be unhappy, but the goal of Alex being happy has been achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it shows Alex's movement back to a common area.
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake's action shows support for Alex and keeps the group dynamic.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey's movement to join the others reinforces the social aspect of the story. 

The focus remains on Alex achieving happiness through the acquisition of the jewelry.
