**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is experiencing Fever. Since Fever is a symptom of Flaze, Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 1.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to assess Young, who is experiencing Rash. Rash is a symptom of Jarkis, so Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well. This further reduces Hathaway's workload to 0.

Now, all patients are healthy: Jones remains in Patient Room A with Unknown symptoms, but since he has not been treated, he is still alive. Ross and Young are both healthy after their treatments.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to understand Jones's condition, even though it remains unknown. It is important for Hathaway to know the status of all patients.
2. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to check on Ross, who is experiencing Fever, to provide the necessary treatment.
3. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: This is the correct treatment for Ross's Fever (Flaze), ensuring he becomes healthy.
4. **Walk to Admissions again**: Hathaway needs to check on Young, who is experiencing Rash, to provide the necessary treatment.
5. **Treat Young with steroids**: This is the correct treatment for Young's Rash (Jarkis), ensuring he becomes healthy.
