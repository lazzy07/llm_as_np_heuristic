Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment dangerous. She knows she needs to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are in a safer location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now a friend, follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their new friendship and ensures they are both safe from the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions to move to safety.

By making peace with the Lizard and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend.
