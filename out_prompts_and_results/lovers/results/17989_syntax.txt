To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have given away the item they had (jewelry) to Casey, who wanted it.
- Casey will be happy because they received the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
- Blake remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this is acceptable.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be with Alex.
2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R12, R22)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
