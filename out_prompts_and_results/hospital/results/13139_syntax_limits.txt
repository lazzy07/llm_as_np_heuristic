In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. Given the current situation, Hathaway has a workload of 3, which means they are at risk of making a mistake. However, they have already assessed Ross and identified that he has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis. 

To ensure all patients are treated correctly, Hathaway will first treat Ross for Jarkis, as they believe he has the correct symptoms. After treating Ross, Hathaway will then assess and treat Jones, who is currently in the admissions room. Since Jones's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to assess him first. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis, which is the correct treatment for his symptoms. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 2 and ensures Ross becomes healthy.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to see Jones, who is waiting to be assessed.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. 

4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, Admissions)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him for Flaze, assuming he has the corresponding symptoms. This treatment will make Jones healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
