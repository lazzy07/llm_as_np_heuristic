To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A and needs to assess and treat patients in Exam Room B, they will admit Ross to Exam Room B.
2. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: Ross is currently in the Admissions room. Hathaway will walk Ross to Exam Room B.
3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms.

Now, let's break down the actions:

1. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to assign Ross to Exam Room B, where Hathaway can assess and treat him. It increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.
   
2. **walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: This action moves Ross to the exam room where he can be assessed and treated. 

3. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomB)**: This action allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will know he has the disease Flaze.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: This action treats Ross with the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.

After these actions, Hathaway will have successfully treated Ross, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
