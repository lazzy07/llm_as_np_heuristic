To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and believes the Merchant and the Bandit are at the Market. He needs to go to the Market to interact with them and potentially secure his goal.

2. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit, who is armed, can rob Tom of the medicine since Tom is unarmed. This action is necessary because Tom cannot defend himself, and the Bandit wants to take the medicine.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit, now carrying the medicine, walks back to the Bandit Camp to secure her loot.

4. **report(Tom, location(Bandit), Market)**: Tom reports the Bandit’s location to the Guard, who is also at the Market. This action is crucial because it alerts the Guard to the Bandit’s presence, which could lead to the Bandit being dealt with.

5. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard, armed and aware of the Bandit’s location, attacks and kills the Bandit. This action is necessary to eliminate the threat and retrieve the medicine.

6. **loot(Tom, Medicine, Bandit, Market)**: After the Bandit is dead, Tom loots the medicine from the Bandit’s corpse. This action allows Tom to regain the medicine he originally had.

7. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom then walks back to the Crossroads with the medicine.

8. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being at the Cottage carrying the medicine.
