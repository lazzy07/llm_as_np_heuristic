1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the dining room.
   
2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I1). This is a truthful statement since Alex genuinely wants I1.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) to retrieve the jewelry (I1) that is located there.
