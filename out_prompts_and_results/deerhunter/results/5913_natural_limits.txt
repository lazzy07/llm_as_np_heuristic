Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He goes from the bank to the forest where Bambi is. Bubba, with the rifle loaded, sees Bambi and decides to shoot. He successfully kills Bambi and then eats the deer. After satisfying his hunger, he returns to the bank with the intention of stealing the clerk's money. 

However, since Bubba has already eaten, he no longer feels the need to steal. Instead, he simply asks the clerk for the money, and the clerk, seeing Bubba's rifle, hands over the money out of fear. Bubba now has the money he wanted.
