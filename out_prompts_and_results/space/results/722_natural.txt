Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and both are healthy but not safe. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, they need to act quickly.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Since she is not safe on the surface, this is a crucial step for her safety.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - Although this action makes the Lizard angry, it is essential for Zoe to communicate with the Lizard and ensure they can escape together. The friendship they have established allows for some tension, but their mutual goal of safety is more important.

3. **Zoe walks with the Lizard to the cave.** - This action allows both characters to move to a safer location away from the erupting surface. The cave provides shelter from the volcanic activity, ensuring both characters can remain healthy and safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** - This reinforces their friendship and ensures that they are both committed to helping each other. It solidifies their bond and mutual goal of safety.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
