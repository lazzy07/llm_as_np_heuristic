In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy, and they are currently in the same room (R22) as Alex (C1) and Blake (C2). Alex has the flowers (I1), and Blake has the chocolates (I2). 

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to trade with Blake. Since Casey wants the jewelry and Blake has the chocolates, they can trade items. This action will allow Casey to obtain the jewelry, making them happy.

Here’s the action that will take place:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry they have (which is currently with Blake) for the chocolates that Blake has. This action is necessary because it directly allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy if they want them.
- Alex will still be unhappy unless they get the item they want.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, achieving Casey's goal with the minimum necessary action.
