To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room. This is important to gather information about Young's condition as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.
