To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coins he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly, which is one of her goals.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has the coins she desires in her possession.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully take his coins without any risk.
- **Walking to the Camp**: After acquiring the coins, the Bandit needs to move to a secure location (the bandit camp) to either keep the coins safe or to further her criminal activities.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has the coins she desires, either to carry them or to store them securely.
