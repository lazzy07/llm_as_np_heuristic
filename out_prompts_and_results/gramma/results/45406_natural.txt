To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. The bandit will loot the merchant's corpse to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to ensure that the merchant's items are no longer in play, and it also allows the bandit to have the medicine, which could be useful later.
2. The bandit will walk from the market to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the bandit to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as it allows the bandit to leave the market and go to a location where the coins are stored.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Bandit loots the merchant's corpse**: The bandit takes the medicine from the dead merchant. This action is crucial because it eliminates the merchant as a competitor for items and allows the bandit to carry something valuable.
2. **Bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp**: The bandit leaves the market and heads to the bandit camp, where the coins are stored. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

The bandit now has the medicine and can secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.
