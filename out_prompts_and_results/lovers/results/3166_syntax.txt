1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **tell(C3, C2, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the flowers. This is a strategic move to ensure Blake knows what Alex desires, which can lead to a potential trade or gift.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the bathroom (R21) to pick up the flowers (I1) that are located there. This is necessary for Blake to obtain the item that Alex wants.
