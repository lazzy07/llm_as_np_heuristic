To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young is already assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Jones in Exam Room B. This is important to determine Jones's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room C. This will complete the assessment of all patients, allowing Hathaway to treat them accordingly.

4. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat Young with antibiotics to ensure they become healthy.

5. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Jones is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat Jones with steroids to ensure they become healthy.

6. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat Ross with steroids to ensure they become healthy.
