In this story, Young is in exam room A, and Hathaway is currently in the same room. Jones and Ross are in the admissions room, and their symptoms are unknown. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if she assesses a patient. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine if they have any symptoms. Since Young is in exam room A, this action is valid and necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze, or if they have a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Young's condition.

2. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the correct medication based on the symptoms identified. This is essential for Young to achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
