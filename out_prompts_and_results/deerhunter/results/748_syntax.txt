To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After obtaining the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba needs to move from the bank to the forest to find Bambi. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi and complete the second part of the goal.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his greedy desire for money by killing the clerk and then fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead by eating her.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he loaded with ammunition to shoot the bank clerk, killing him and allowing Bubba to take the money.
2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank.
3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then travels to the forest where Bambi is located.
4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba finds Bambi and eats her, ensuring she is dead.

This sequence of actions leads to both outcomes: Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead.
