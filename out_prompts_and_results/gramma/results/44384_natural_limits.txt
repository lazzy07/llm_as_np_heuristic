The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She knows that the guard is present and that the merchant is dead, leaving Tom vulnerable. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where she sees Tom. 

Since Tom is not armed, the bandit can easily rob him. She approaches Tom and, with her sword drawn, she demands his coin. Tom, believing he is in danger, hands over his coin to the bandit. 

Now, the bandit has successfully acquired another coin, which she can add to the one already in her chest at the bandit camp. With her goal of carrying as many coins as possible achieved, she walks back to the bandit camp, satisfied with her haul.
