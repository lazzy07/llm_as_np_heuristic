Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both needs. He goes to the bank where he knows there is money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the bank clerk into giving him the money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba threatens the bank clerk and steals the money from him.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger indirectly by ensuring he has resources for future needs.
