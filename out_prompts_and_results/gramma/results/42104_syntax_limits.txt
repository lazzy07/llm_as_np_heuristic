To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom at the Crossroads to take the coin that Tom is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the market or engage in more complex actions.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp. This action is essential as it allows the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in her possession.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action (rob) is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins. Since Tom is not armed, the bandit can successfully take the coin from him.
- The second action (walk) is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location, the camp, where she can store her coins safely.
