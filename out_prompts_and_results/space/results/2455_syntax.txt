To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Since they are currently on the surface and both characters are healthy but not safe due to the dangerous status of the surface, Zoe should take actions that will help her achieve her goals.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe can initiate the eruption of the volcano to create a sense of urgency and danger, prompting both her and the Lizard to seek safety together. This action is necessary to highlight the immediate threat they face.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is crucial for her safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave, ensuring that both characters are in the same location and can interact without the threat of the volcano.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe can make peace with the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in their new environment.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
