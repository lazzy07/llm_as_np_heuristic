To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R21) and has not yet obtained the jewelry. Casey (C3) currently has the jewelry, but all characters are unhappy.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey (C3) will have the chocolates (I3) and will be unhappy, but since Alex is now happy, the goal is achieved.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Alex to exchange the chocolates for the jewelry, fulfilling Alex's desire for the jewelry and making them happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
