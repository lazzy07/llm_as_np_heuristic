**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores, Ernest finds himself in the hallway, holding the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he and Roy are both threatened by him. To protect himself and Roy, Ernest decides to take a bold step. He locks the gym door to trap the bully inside, preventing him from coming after them.

Next, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself to avoid detection. With the disguise on, he successfully escapes from the prison, leaving the threats of the bully behind.
