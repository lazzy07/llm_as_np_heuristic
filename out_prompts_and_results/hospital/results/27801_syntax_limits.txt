**Story Completion:**

After walking back to PatientRoomA, Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is the only patient in the room, Hathaway focuses on him. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to see what symptoms he is showing. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway determines that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Young**: Hathaway then admits Young to PatientRoomB, ensuring that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated later. This action is necessary to manage the workload and ensure all patients are accounted for.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Ross** is essential to identify his condition accurately, which is the first step in providing appropriate care.
- **Treating Ross** with the correct medication (antibiotics for Flaze) is critical to achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
- **Admitting Young** is necessary to keep the workflow organized and ensure that all patients are being attended to, even if Young's treatment will occur later.
