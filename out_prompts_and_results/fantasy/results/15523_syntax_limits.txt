To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy (or both), we can focus on the proposal made by Rory and the potential for marriage, which would make both Rory and Talia happy. Since Talia is currently in the Cave and Rory has proposed to her, the next logical step is for Talia to accept the proposal. This will lead to their marriage, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her primary goals.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: After Talia accepts the proposal, they get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures that both characters are happy.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to achieving Talia's goal of happiness, as it involves only two actions and directly addresses her desire.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept**: This action is necessary for Talia to acknowledge Rory's proposal, which is the first step towards achieving happiness.
- **marry**: This action finalizes their relationship, ensuring both characters are happy, particularly Talia, who desires happiness.
