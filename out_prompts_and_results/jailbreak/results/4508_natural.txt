**Story Completion:**

As Ernest sneaks into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Knowing that he is threatened, Ernest decides to take action. He quietly approaches the bully, knife in hand, and in a moment of desperation, he lunges forward and kills the bully. 

With the bully now out of the way, Ernest quickly searches the bully's belongings and finds a pack of cigarettes. He takes the cigarettes and, feeling a sense of relief, decides to leave the gym. 

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the laundry room, is unaware of the events unfolding in the gym. He finishes his chores and decides to check on Ernest. He moves to the hallway and crawls through the vents to the gym. 

When Roy arrives, he sees the aftermath of the confrontation. Ernest, holding the pack of cigarettes, looks relieved but shaken. They quickly discuss their next move. 

Ernest suggests they put on the civilian clothes from the laundry room to disguise themselves. They both agree, and once they are disguised, they make their way to the hallway. 

Finally, they step outside onto the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
