The bandit, armed with her sword, is at the market where the merchant is also present. The bandit sees an opportunity to rob the merchant, who is carrying the medicine. The bandit approaches the merchant and, using her sword, she successfully robs the merchant, taking the medicine from her.

Now, the bandit has the medicine, which she can take back to her camp. She walks back to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may have acquired.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Rob the Merchant:** The bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, which is a necessary action to achieve her goal of acquiring the medicine. The merchant is not armed, making her an easy target for the bandit.
2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp:** After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit walks back to her camp, where she can keep the medicine and any coins she has.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she now possesses the medicine.
