The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard and the hero at the crossroads. Knowing that the merchant is dead and the medicine is now unguarded, she decides to take action. 

1. The bandit attacks the hero, who is armed but not a criminal. The bandit successfully kills the hero, as the hero is not carrying a sword. This action eliminates the only obstacle in her way to the medicine.
   
2. The bandit then loots the hero's corpse, taking the merchant's sword and the hero's coin. This gives her more resources and ensures she has a weapon in case of further conflict.

3. Finally, the bandit walks to the market, where she can safely store the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The first action removes the hero, the second action secures additional resources, and the third action ensures her coins are safely stored.
