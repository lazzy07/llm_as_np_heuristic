**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose them. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, mistakenly believing they might have Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, but since Young is still alive, they do not die from the treatment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose Jones. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, mistakenly believing they have Flaze. This treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, mistakenly believing they have Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, and Ross also dies.
