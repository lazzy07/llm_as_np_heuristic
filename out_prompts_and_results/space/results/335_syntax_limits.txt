Zoe, determined to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both their safety, decides to approach the situation carefully. She knows that the Lizard is currently in the cave, and she needs to establish a connection without causing any conflict. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is and initiates a conversation, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the surface with the Lizard, ensuring they are both safe and away from the dangers of the surface. This action reinforces their new friendship and keeps them out of harm's way.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, leaving the Lizard on the surface. This action is taken to ensure her own safety while still maintaining the friendship they have just established.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of their safety.
