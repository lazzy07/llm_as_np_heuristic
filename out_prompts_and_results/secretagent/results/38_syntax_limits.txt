To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent can take the following actions:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to be in the same location as the mastermind to carry out the next action.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the lobby. This action directly fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
