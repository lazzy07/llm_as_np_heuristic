To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is necessary because Talia currently has the money, and by removing her from the equation, Gargax can take the money from her dead body, which will help Rory in the long run.
   
2. **Gargax takes the money from Talia.** - Gargax takes the money from Talia's body, which increases Gargax's wealth. This action is essential for Rory's goal because it allows Gargax to be satisfied and not hungry, which is a prerequisite for Rory's happiness.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave.** - Gargax needs to go to the cave to access the treasure, which is crucial for Rory's goal of wealth.

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure.** - By picking up the treasure, Gargax increases their wealth further, which indirectly supports Rory's goal of wealth.

5. **Gargax travels back to the village.** - Gargax returns to the village with the treasure, which is necessary for the final actions that will lead to Rory's happiness.

6. **Gargax eats Rory.** - Gargax eats Rory, which allows Rory to take the treasure from Gargax's dead body, fulfilling Rory's need for wealth.

7. **Rory takes the treasure from Gargax.** - This action allows Rory to achieve their goal of wealth, as they now possess the treasure.

8. **Rory becomes happy.** - With the treasure in hand, Rory achieves happiness, fulfilling their goal.
