To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba is at the bank and the clerk has 1 money, and Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk.
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** - After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank to avoid any potential confrontation with the clerk.
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** - Now that Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, he can focus on satisfying his hunger.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money since he currently has 0 money and the clerk has 1 money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to ensure that the clerk cannot retaliate or report him after stealing the money. 
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** - After successfully stealing the money and ensuring the clerk cannot stop him, Bubba leaves the bank to avoid any further complications.
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** - Now that Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, he can focus on satisfying his hunger.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.",
    "Bubba goes from the bank to the house.",
    "Bubba decides to eat."
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger. Each action is necessary to navigate the story's constraints and achieve the desired outcome.
