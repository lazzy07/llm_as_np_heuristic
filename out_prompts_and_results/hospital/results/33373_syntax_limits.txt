**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Flaze, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can determine if Young has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. This action is necessary to identify Young's condition and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young and confirming that they have a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition, leading to their recovery.

3. **Walk Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess the next patient, Jones, who is waiting there. This action is necessary to continue providing care to the patients and ensure that all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to assess Young to confirm their symptoms. This is essential for Hathaway to make an informed decision about treatment.
- The second action is to treat Young with the correct medication (antibiotics) based on the confirmed diagnosis of Flaze. This is critical for Young's recovery and aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
- The third action is to move to the Admissions room to check on Jones, ensuring that Hathaway continues to provide care to all patients.
