**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, he finds the bully distracted and seizes the opportunity to confront him. With the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen, Ernest kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Roy are no longer threatened.
