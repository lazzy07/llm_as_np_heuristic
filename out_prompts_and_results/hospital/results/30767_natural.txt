**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is showing symptoms of a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she knows that Ross is in Patient Room A and has a rash. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** 
   - This action is necessary because Ross is showing symptoms of a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Treating him with steroids will make him healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess the other patients.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary for Hathaway to check on Jones and Young, who are both in the admissions room and need to be assigned to exam rooms.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Young is also assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

Now, Dr. Hathaway assesses both patients in their respective rooms.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine what symptoms Jones is experiencing.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to determine what symptoms Young is experiencing.

Assuming that both Jones and Young are found to have unknown symptoms but are otherwise healthy, Dr. Hathaway can treat them accordingly.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**
   - This action is necessary if Jones is found to have a fever, which would indicate Flaze.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**
   - This action is necessary if Young is also found to have a fever, indicating Flaze.

After these actions, all patients are treated and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients effectively, reducing her workload and ensuring that each patient receives the correct treatment based on their symptoms. The goal is to have all patients healthy, which is achieved through careful assessment and treatment.
