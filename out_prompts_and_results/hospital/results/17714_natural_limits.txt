Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to treat Young in Patient Room A. Since Young is exhibiting a rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis and administers steroids. This treatment is successful, and Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones and Ross, who are still waiting. Since both patients are experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway admits them to their respective exam rooms (B and C) for further assessment.

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis (successful treatment).
2. Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross.
3. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B and Ross to Exam Room C.

This sequence of actions ensures that Young is treated successfully, and Dr. Hathaway can continue to work towards the health of the other patients.
