Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C. Since Jones is still in Admissions, Hathaway can easily assign him to the available room. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C, discovering that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.
