In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. Given the current situation, Hathaway has a workload of 3, which means they are at risk of making a mistake when assessing or treating patients. To achieve their goal, Hathaway needs to reduce their workload and correctly assess and treat the patients.

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room A to assess Ross. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure that he receives the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, this assessment is crucial to avoid a potential mistake.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is essential for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway successfully reduces their workload and treats Ross correctly, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
