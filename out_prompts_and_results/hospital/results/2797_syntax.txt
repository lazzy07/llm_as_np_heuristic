To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Ross's condition will help Hathaway manage his workload and ensure that all patients are treated correctly.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the admissions room. This is important to gather information about Young's symptoms, which will help Hathaway in making informed treatment decisions.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis; if he has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze. This action is crucial to ensure Ross receives the appropriate treatment.

4. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will then treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This is necessary to ensure that Young also receives the appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones in PatientRoomC. Since Jones is already in this room, he can be treated based on the symptoms identified earlier. This is the final step to ensure that Jones is healthy.

By following these steps, Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
