To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R22)**. This action is necessary because it creates a belief in Blake that Alex wants the item that Casey actually wants, which can lead to a trade or a transfer of items.

2. **Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21)**. This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex, where they can interact and potentially trade items.

3. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the living room (R21)**. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
