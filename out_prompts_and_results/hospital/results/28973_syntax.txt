To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young is showing a different symptom (SymptomB) than Ross (SymptomA), and Hathaway needs to understand Young's condition to treat them correctly.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure Young is in a designated exam room for treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Hathaway will treat Young with steroids in Exam Room C, as Young has SymptomB (the rash associated with Jarkis). This treatment is necessary for Young to become healthy.

4. **Assess Ross Again**: Hathaway will assess Ross again in Exam Room A to confirm his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics in Exam Room A, as Ross has SymptomA (the fever associated with Flaze). This treatment is necessary for Ross to become healthy.

By following these steps, both Young and Ross will be treated correctly, ensuring they both achieve their goals of being alive and healthy.
