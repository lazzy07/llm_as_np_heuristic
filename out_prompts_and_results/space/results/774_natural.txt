Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensure her safety. Since the surface is erupting, staying there would put her at risk.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and continue building their friendship. This action shows her commitment to the Lizard and their relationship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They both need to find a safe place away from the erupting volcano. The cave is a secure location where they can be safe together.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - This reinforces their friendship and ensures that they are both committed to helping each other. It solidifies their bond and mutual goals of safety and health.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
