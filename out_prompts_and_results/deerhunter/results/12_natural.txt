Bubba is determined to get money, and he is currently in the forest with Bambi. The bank clerk is at the bank with 1 money. To achieve his goal, Bubba needs to take specific actions that will lead him to acquire the money.

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** This action is necessary because Bambi is a deer, and if Bubba kills Bambi, he can then eat her, which will allow him to become hungry and then decide to eat. However, since Bubba's goal is to get money, he will not eat Bambi but rather use the situation to create a distraction.

2. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded rifle to shoot Bambi.

3. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** This action is necessary to eliminate Bambi, which will allow Bubba to create a diversion and potentially scare the bank clerk into giving him the money.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk.** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have 1 money, and since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

After these actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining 1 money.
