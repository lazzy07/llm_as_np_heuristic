To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give the item that Alex wants to Casey, who is currently holding the flowers.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) will give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial as it directly provides Alex with the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Trade**: This action allows Blake to facilitate the exchange of items, ensuring that Alex can eventually get what they want.
