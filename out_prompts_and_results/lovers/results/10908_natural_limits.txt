In the dining room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since Blake has the jewelry, they can help themselves by trading it for the chocolates.

Blake decides to take action. 

1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.** This action is necessary because it allows Casey to achieve their goal of obtaining the jewelry, which makes Casey happy. 

2. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.** This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of obtaining the chocolates, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows: 
- Alex is still unhappy because they do not have the jewelry.
- Blake is now happy because they have the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry.

This story is short and efficient, as it only includes the necessary actions to ensure Blake achieves their goal.
