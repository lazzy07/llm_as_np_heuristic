In the current situation, all characters are in the living room (R11), and none of them are happy. Casey wants the jewelry (I1), which is currently with Blake (C3). To achieve their goal, Casey needs to get the jewelry from Blake.

**Action:**
1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R11)** - Blake trades the jewelry (I1) with Casey for the chocolates (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Casey now has the jewelry (I1) and is happy.
- Blake has the chocolates (I3) and is not happy, but they have helped Casey achieve their goal.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry. Since all characters are in the same room, the trade can occur without any need for movement or additional actions.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
