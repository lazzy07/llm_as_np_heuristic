In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex, holding the jewelry, wants the flowers that Blake has. Blake, who wants the chocolates, believes they are in the bathroom. Casey, who wants the jewelry, believes it is with Alex. 

To help Blake achieve their goal of happiness, Blake decides to give the flowers to Alex, believing that this will make Alex happy. 

**Action:**
1. Blake gives the flowers to Alex.

**Explanation:**
