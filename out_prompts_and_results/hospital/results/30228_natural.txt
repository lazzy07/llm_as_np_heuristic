Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. This is a mistake, as Ross does not have Jarkis, but he survives the treatment.
