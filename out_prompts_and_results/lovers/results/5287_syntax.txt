To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Blake to check on Casey and potentially help them achieve their own happiness later.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, which means Alex is happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to facilitate the next action.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it directly gives Alex the item they want, thus making Alex happy.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: While this action does not directly contribute to Alex's happiness, it allows Blake to move to another room, which could be useful for future interactions.
