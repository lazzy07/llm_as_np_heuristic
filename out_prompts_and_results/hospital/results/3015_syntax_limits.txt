**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is in the admissions room, Hathaway believes he is in PatientRoomA due to the previous admit action. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing, Hathaway determines that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Jones, PatientRoomC, Admissions**: After being treated, Jones walks back to the admissions room to confirm his health status and ensure he is alive and healthy. This action is necessary for Jones to feel secure about his recovery.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess**: This action is essential for Hathaway to diagnose Jones correctly. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot determine the appropriate treatment.
  
- **Treat**: This action is critical as it directly impacts Jones's health. Administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze) is necessary for Jones to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

- **Walk**: This action allows Jones to return to the admissions room, reinforcing his status as a healthy patient and ensuring he is aware of his recovery.
