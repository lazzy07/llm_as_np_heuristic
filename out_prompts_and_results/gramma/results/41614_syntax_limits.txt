To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. This action allows him to reach his desired location.

This single action is sufficient for Tom to achieve his goal, as he is already carrying the medicine.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because it directly moves Tom from his current location (Crossroads) to his desired location (Cottage) while carrying the medicine. Since Tom's goal is to be at the cottage with the medicine, this action fulfills that requirement.
