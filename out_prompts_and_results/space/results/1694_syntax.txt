To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the cave to the surface to confront Zoe. This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be in the same location as Zoe to interact with her and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Once the Lizard reaches the surface, it will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to stop any potential fighting and start building a friendship, which is one of the Lizard's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is included to show that Zoe is willing to explore the Lizard's home and further solidify their friendship.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will then follow Zoe to the cave. This action demonstrates the Lizard's willingness to engage with Zoe and explore together, reinforcing their newfound friendship.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Finally, Zoe will make peace with the Lizard again in the cave. This action is included to ensure that their friendship is solidified in a safe environment, away from the dangers of the surface.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
