To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R22) and has the jewelry (I1) in their possession. However, Alex is not happy yet, which indicates that they need to give the jewelry to Casey (C3) to make them happy, as Casey wants the jewelry (I3).

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and by giving it to them, Casey will become happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will no longer have the jewelry (I1) but will be happy because they made Casey happy.
- Casey (C3) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this action fulfills that requirement.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, making Casey happy and fulfilling Alex's goal of wanting Casey to be happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C1, I1, C3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by making Casey happy with the jewelry.
