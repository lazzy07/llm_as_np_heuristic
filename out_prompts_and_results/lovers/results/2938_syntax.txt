To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **tell(C3, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry. This action is important because it communicates Casey's desire directly to Alex, who is currently holding the jewelry.

3. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey. This action is crucial as it fulfills Casey's desire and makes them happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
