**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the laundry room, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to act quickly.

1. **Roy moves from the highway to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to get back into the prison to help Ernest.)
2. **Roy sneaks through the vent to the laundry room.** (This allows Roy to reach Ernest without being seen by the bully.)
3. **Roy tells Ernest to stay calm and that he has a plan.** (This reassures Ernest and prepares him for the next steps.)
4. **Roy and Ernest move to the hallway together.** (They need to be together to execute the escape plan.)
5. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from following them and ensures their safety.)
6. **Roy and Ernest go to the highway.** (They are now on the path to escape.)
7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him and allows him to blend in outside the prison.)
8. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him as well, ensuring both can escape.)
9. **Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** (This is the final action that achieves their goal of being alive and free.)
