Zoe, the space explorer, is currently in a cave on the planet, while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. The situation is tense, as the Lizard is aware of Zoe's presence but is not yet friendly towards her.

To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to take actions that foster a positive relationship. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to a successful outcome:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and walk to the surface where the Lizard is. This action is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe reaches the surface, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of becoming friends with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, this action can succeed.

After these actions, Zoe and the Lizard will have established a friendship, fulfilling both of their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: This action is necessary for Zoe to physically reach the Lizard and initiate interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is essential for achieving the goal of friendship, as it allows both characters to connect positively.
