To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom attacks the bandit.** (Tom is armed with the merchant's sword, and the bandit is not armed with a sword, making this action possible.)
2. **Tom loots the bandit's corpse.** (After defeating the bandit, Tom can take the medicine from the bandit's body.)
3. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** (Tom can now move to the cottage with the medicine he has looted.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Tom attacks the bandit:** This action is necessary because the bandit is the only character who has the medicine that Tom wants. By attacking, Tom can eliminate the threat and gain access to the medicine.
- **Tom loots the bandit's corpse:** After defeating the bandit, Tom can take the medicine, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
- **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage:** This final action allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.
