To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. Since the medicine is with the Merchant at the Cottage, Tom needs to walk to the Cottage to achieve his goal.

This action is sufficient because it directly leads Tom to his desired location without any conflict or need for additional actions. 

Here’s the complete story with the necessary action:

Tom stood at the Crossroads, determined to reach the Cottage where he could finally obtain the medicine he needed. With a firm grip on his newly acquired sword, he set his sights on the path leading to the Cottage. Without hesitation, he walked down the path, leaving the bustling Market behind him.

As he approached the Cottage, he felt a sense of relief wash over him. He had successfully navigated the Crossroads and was now one step closer to his goal.
