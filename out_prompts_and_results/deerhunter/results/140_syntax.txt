To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to threaten the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken to eliminate the clerk as a threat and to take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then goes to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but can be seen as a way for Bubba to escape after committing the crime.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The actions are structured to ensure that Bubba achieves his greedy desire for money while also ensuring Bambi's death, thus satisfying both conditions of the ending.
