In the current situation, Blake (C3) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Blake needs to acquire the item I2. 

Since Casey (C2) is currently holding I1, which Blake believes is I2, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade I1 with Casey for I2. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Here’s how the story unfolds:

- **Action**: trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)
  - Blake approaches Casey and suggests a trade. Since Casey believes that I1 is what Blake wants, they agree to the trade. Blake gives I1 to Casey and receives I2 in return.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Blake is now happy because they have I2.
- Casey is also happy because they have I1, which they wanted.
- Alex remains unhappy because they still do not have I1.

The story is complete with just this one action, as Blake has achieved their goal of happiness.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)"]
