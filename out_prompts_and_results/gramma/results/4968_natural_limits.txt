Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, armed and dangerous. Knowing he is unarmed, Tom decides to take a calculated risk. He quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. 

The guard, alerted to the bandit's presence, rushes to the crossroads. Upon arrival, the guard sees the bandit and, armed with his sword, attacks and kills her. With the bandit defeated, Tom is now safe to walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine.

This action sequence is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. By reporting the bandit, he ensures that the guard can eliminate the threat, allowing him to safely return home.
