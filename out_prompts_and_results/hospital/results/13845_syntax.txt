To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first reduce the workload by treating one patient correctly, which will allow Hathaway to assess the remaining patients without the risk of error.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment is required.
2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This will ensure Young becomes healthy and reduces Hathaway's workload by one.
3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms.
4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (the fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, ensuring Ross becomes healthy and further reducing the workload.
5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

This sequence ensures that Hathaway can treat all patients correctly without making mistakes due to an overloaded workload.
