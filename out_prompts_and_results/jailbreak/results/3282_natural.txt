**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife. He quickly moves to the gym, where he can confront the bully without being threatened in the cell block.

Once inside the gym, Ernest locks the door behind him to prevent the bully from escaping. The bully, unaware of Ernest's disguise, is caught off guard. Ernest then uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened.

With the bully dead, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He can now safely escape the prison. He leaves the gym, still in his civilian clothes, and heads to the hallway. From there, he crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he takes off the disguise and walks away, free at last.
