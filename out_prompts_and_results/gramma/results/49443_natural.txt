The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take action to achieve her goal. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant is located, as she needs to interact with the merchant to obtain coins.

2. **The bandit attacks the merchant.**  
   - The bandit is armed and the merchant is not armed, making this action possible. By attacking the merchant, the bandit can take the medicine and any coins the merchant may have.

3. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse.**  
   - After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit can loot the merchant's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the merchant was carrying.

4. **The bandit walks back to the crossroads.**  
   - With the medicine and any coins obtained from the merchant, the bandit returns to the crossroads to secure her loot in the chest.

5. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the merchant, which is essential for her to obtain coins.
- Attacking the merchant allows her to take the items she needs without facing any immediate consequences, as the merchant is unarmed.
- Looting the merchant's corpse is a necessary follow-up to ensure she collects the items she has just taken from the merchant.
- Returning to the crossroads is crucial for the bandit to secure her loot and avoid any potential confrontation with the guard.
- Finally, placing the coins in the chest at the bandit camp fulfills her goal of accumulating wealth.
