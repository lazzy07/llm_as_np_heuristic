**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Roy is in the cell block with the pack of cigarettes, but they are both threatened by the bully. To ensure his safety and to help Roy, Ernest decides to take action. 

Ernest quickly crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where the bully is currently spending his recreation time. Once inside the gym, he locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten either him or Roy while they are separated. 

With the bully locked in, Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously left there. He then confronts the bully and kills him, eliminating the threat once and for all. 

Now that the bully is dead, Ernest can safely return to the cell block to reunite with Roy. They can now enjoy the pack of cigarettes together without fear of being threatened.
