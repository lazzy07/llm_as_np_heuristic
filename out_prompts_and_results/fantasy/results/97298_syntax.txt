To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as she has already accepted his proposal. The quickest way for Talia to achieve her goal is to marry Rory, which will make them both happy. After that, Talia can travel back to the cave to collect the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action is necessary because Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, and marrying him will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.

2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: After marrying Rory, Talia needs to travel to the cave to collect the treasure, which is essential for her to achieve her wealth goal.

3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to pick up the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Now, Talia has achieved both her goals of happiness (from marrying Rory) and wealth (from picking up the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's happiness goal by solidifying her relationship with Rory.
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to reach the treasure, which is located in the cave.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, thus achieving her wealth goal.
