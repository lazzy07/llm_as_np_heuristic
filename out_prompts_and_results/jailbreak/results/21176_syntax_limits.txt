**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the kitchen, Roy realizes that he needs to escape the prison to ensure both his and Ernest's safety from the bully. He has already stolen a set of civilian clothes from the laundry room, which he can use to disguise himself. 

Roy decides to put on the civilian clothes in the kitchen, disguising himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards when he makes his escape.
