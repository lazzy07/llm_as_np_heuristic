**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. 

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to get the knife to protect himself and Roy from the bully.)
2. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for him to have a means of defense against the bully.)
3. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (He needs to get closer to the gym where Roy and the bully are.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives him a chance to confront the bully.)
5. **Ernest enters the gym with the knife.** (He is now ready to confront the bully and protect himself and Roy.)
