To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going to the bank**: This is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and access the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, which is one of the goals of the story.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will still be confirmed dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
