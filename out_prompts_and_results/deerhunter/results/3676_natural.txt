To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the power to take the money from the clerk.

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, wanting the money, will decide to steal from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.

3. **Bubba decides to eat**: After stealing the money, Bubba is still hungry, so he decides to eat.
4. **Bubba goes to the forest**: Bubba will go to the forest where Bambi is located.
5. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can shoot Bambi, resulting in her death.
