To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure the money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, having a loaded rifle, can steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and he can use the threat of his rifle to take it from the clerk.

2. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is already established in the story, indicating Bubba's intent to acquire money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary to remove him from the bank and signify that he has completed his goal.

At this point, Bubba has successfully stolen the money from the clerk, and Bambi is confirmed dead from the earlier events. 

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **steal**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also confirming that Bambi is dead, as he has already eaten her.
- **decide_to_get_money**: This action shows Bubba's motivation and is already established in the story.
- **go**: This action signifies Bubba's departure from the bank after successfully stealing the money.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, House)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
