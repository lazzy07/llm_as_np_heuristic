Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous and that her friend, the Lizard, is in peril, decides to teleport back to the surface to help. She knows that the volcano is about to erupt, and she wants to ensure the Lizard's safety. Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard in a state of distress, as the ground begins to shake and the volcano shows signs of imminent eruption. 

Zoe quickly reassures the Lizard, and they both work together to find a safe spot away from the volcano. In this moment of cooperation, they strengthen their bond and become even better friends. However, despite their efforts, the volcano erupts, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise.

The actions taken are as follows:
1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help him, as she is aware of the danger he is in.
2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace**: This action solidifies their friendship and teamwork in the face of danger, even though it ultimately leads to the Lizard's death due to the eruption.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe remains safe on the surface.
