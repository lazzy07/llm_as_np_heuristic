To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to return to the bank where the clerk is located to get the money. This action is necessary to move to the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because Bubba believes that the only way to get the money is to eliminate the clerk.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is the final step to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:
