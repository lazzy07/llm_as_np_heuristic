To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** - Gargax, wanting to be wealthy and not hungry, sees Rory as a potential meal. This action reduces the number of humans in the cave, allowing Talia to focus on her goals without interference from Rory.

2. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Following the same logic, Gargax then eats Vince. With both Rory and Vince gone, Talia is now the only human left in the cave, and she possesses the treasure.

3. **Talia takes the money from the dead body of Vince.** - Now that Vince is dead, Talia can take the money he had. This action increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.

4. **Talia's happiness increases.** - With the treasure and the money, Talia feels a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, leading to her happiness increasing.

At this point, Talia has achieved her goals of being happy and wealthy, as she now possesses both the treasure and the money.
