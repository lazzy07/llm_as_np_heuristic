Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, creating an immediate danger for both Zoe and the Lizard. This action is necessary to introduce urgency and a reason for them to seek safety together.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is taken to ensure both characters can find refuge.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it shows their cooperation and mutual goal of safety.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship and commitment to helping each other. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures they are no longer in conflict.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts fully, but since both characters are now safely in the cave, they are unharmed. This action concludes the immediate danger and highlights the success of their cooperation.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves their goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
