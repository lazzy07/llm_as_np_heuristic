To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with a loaded rifle, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and hungry, which motivates him to take action.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go back to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the condition of the story.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the forest where Bambi is located after he has taken the money from the clerk.

The final story sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
