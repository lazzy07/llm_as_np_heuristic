To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is necessary:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village where the Money is located. This action is essential because Rory currently has no wealth and needs to acquire the Money to fulfill their goal of being wealthy. 

After this action, Rory will be in the Village, where they can access the Money, thus achieving their goal of being wealthy. Since Rory is already happy due to the acceptance of Talia's proposal, and they are not hungry, this action completes the story.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action allows Rory to leave the Cave, where he currently is, and go to the Village, where he can find the Money. This is the only action needed for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy, as he already has happiness from his relationship with Talia and is not hungry.
