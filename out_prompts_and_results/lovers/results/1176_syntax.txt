To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will be taken to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I1).
- Blake (C2) is happy because they have given away the jewelry (I3) and have made Casey happy.
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R12, R22)",
    "give(C2, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to reach Blake, who has the jewelry. Without this movement, Casey cannot interact with Blake to receive the item they want.
- **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: This action is the key to fulfilling Casey's desire. By giving the jewelry to Casey, Blake ensures that Casey is happy, which is the ultimate goal of the story.
