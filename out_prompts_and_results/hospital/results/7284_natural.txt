**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to assign Jones to an exam room so that he can be assessed and treated.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is now in Patient Room B.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** (Assuming Jones has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure he becomes healthy. Since Jones's symptoms were unknown, this is a calculated risk.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Ross next.)

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** (Assuming Ross also has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure he becomes healthy.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Young next.)

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** (Assuming Young has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure he becomes healthy.)

At the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are treated for Flaze and become healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
