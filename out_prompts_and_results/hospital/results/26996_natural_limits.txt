Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to take action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms, which will help Hathaway determine the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Jones is crucial to moving forward.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** Assuming that Jones has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment will make Jones healthy. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.** After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to admit Young to an exam room to ensure that all patients are being attended to, thus reducing their workload and allowing for better patient care.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Jones, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with their goal of having all hospital patients be healthy.
