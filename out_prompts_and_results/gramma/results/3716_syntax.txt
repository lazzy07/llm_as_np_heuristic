To complete the story, Tom needs to get the medicine from the merchant and return to the cottage. Since Tom is currently at the crossroads and has already robbed the merchant of a coin, he can now buy the medicine from the merchant. After acquiring the medicine, he can walk back to the cottage.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: Tom uses the coin he just robbed from the merchant to buy the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom walks back to the cottage. This action is essential for Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **buy**: Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal of being at the cottage carrying it.
- **walk**: Tom needs to return to the cottage after obtaining the medicine.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
