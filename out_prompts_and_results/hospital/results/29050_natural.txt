**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway is currently at Patient Room A with Ross, who is experiencing Fever. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Dr. Hathaway needs to treat Ross for Flaze, the disease associated with fever.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - This action is necessary because Ross has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway will then turn to the other patients in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated if needed.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are currently unknown, this assessment will help Hathaway understand what treatment, if any, is required.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the only other symptom that could be present), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Young is also healthy.

At this point, both Ross and Young are healthy, and Hathaway has achieved their goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Ross for Flaze is the first and most critical action, as it directly addresses the fever symptom and ensures Ross's health.
- Admitting Young to Patient Room B is necessary to facilitate his assessment and treatment.
- Assessing Young is crucial to identify his symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.
- Treating Young for Jarkis ensures that he is also healthy, completing Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
