To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat too many patients. Therefore, the best course of action is to first assess one patient at a time, starting with Ross, who is in Exam Room A. After assessing Ross, Hathaway can treat him based on the symptoms observed. Then, Hathaway will assess and treat Jones in Exam Room C. Finally, Hathaway will assess and treat Young in Exam Room B. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This ensures Ross becomes healthy.
3. **Walk to Exam Room C**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Jones next. This is necessary to continue the treatment process.
4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment.
5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This ensures Jones becomes healthy.
6. **Walk to Exam Room B**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room B to assess Young next. This is necessary to continue the treatment process.
7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment.
8. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This ensures Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly without exceeding their workload limit, thus achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
