To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has it.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk as a threat and to take the money without resistance.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Decide to steal the money:** This sets Bubba's intention to take the money from the clerk, which is essential for achieving his goal.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action removes the clerk as an obstacle, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action is what allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
