In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to ensure he has both the treasure and the money, as well as maintain his happiness.

Since Rory already has the treasure and is at the village, he can take the following action:

1. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** This action is necessary because it allows Rory to acquire the money he needs to be wealthy. Since Vince is at the cave and has the money, Rory can take it from him, assuming Vince is dead (as per the rules of the story).
