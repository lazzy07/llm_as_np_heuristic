Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship yet. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to take actions that foster a positive connection. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** This action follows naturally from making peace. Once they are no longer enemies, they can form a friendship, which is essential for Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

With these two actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, who is also seeking the same.
