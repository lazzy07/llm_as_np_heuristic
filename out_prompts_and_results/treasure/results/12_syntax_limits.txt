After arriving on the island, Hawkins and Silver begin searching for the treasure. Hawkins knows the treasure is buried nearby, and he has a plan to outsmart Silver. 

First, Hawkins decides to dig up the treasure. Since Silver believes the treasure is buried on the island, he will not suspect Hawkins' true intentions. Hawkins digs at the spot where he knows the treasure is buried, and after a short while, he uncovers the chest filled with gold and jewels.

Next, Hawkins takes the treasure for himself. He knows that Silver, being a pirate, would have taken it without hesitation if he had discovered it first. By acting quickly, Hawkins secures the treasure and ensures that it is now in his possession.
