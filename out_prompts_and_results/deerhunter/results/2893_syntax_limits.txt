Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, is in the forest with a loaded rifle. He spots Bambi, the deer, and decides to take advantage of the situation. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger by providing him with food, as he can eat the deer.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger and allowing him to continue living.

These two actions are sufficient for Bubba to achieve his goal of satisfying his hunger while also being in a position of power with the rifle.
