To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, BanditCamp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves from the Bandit Camp to the Crossroads, where she can potentially interact with Tom and the Merchant.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit continues to the Market, where she can find Tom and the Merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom of his coin while Tom is unarmed. This action allows the Bandit to acquire more coins.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, BanditCamp)**: The Bandit returns to the Bandit Camp with the stolen coin.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market to continue her business.

6. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant uses her coins to buy the medicine from Tom, achieving her goal of acquiring items without becoming a criminal.

In this story, the Merchant successfully acquires the medicine while the Bandit increases her coin count through robbery. The Merchant's actions are legal, and she does not engage in any criminal activity, thus fulfilling her goal.
