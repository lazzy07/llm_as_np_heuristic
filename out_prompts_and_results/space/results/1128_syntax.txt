To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important because it brings Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, allowing for potential interaction and the possibility of making peace.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. It is crucial for achieving their mutual goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which will lead to the death of a character on the surface. Since Zoe is now in the cave with the Lizard, she is safe, but the eruption will still occur.

5. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is included to signify that the Lizard, being on the surface when the volcano erupts, will die. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying as a result of the eruption.

The final sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **begin_erupt**: Starts the eruption process.
- **walk**: Moves Zoe to the cave to interact with the Lizard.
- **make_peace**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
- **erupt**: Executes the eruption of the volcano.
- **kill**: Represents the Lizard's death due to the eruption.
