To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank with some money, and Bambi is also in the forest.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary because he needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba reaches the bank, he uses the loaded rifle to shoot the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk, as he is greedy and wants the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his goal of obtaining money.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Since Bubba is hungry, he decides to eat. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal of obtaining money, but it aligns with his current state of hunger.

5. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba goes back to the forest. This action is not necessary for achieving his goal but provides closure to the story as he leaves the bank after obtaining the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Necessary to confront the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Necessary to take the clerk's money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Necessary to achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Aligns with Bubba's hunger but not necessary for the goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Provides closure to the story.
