**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B to ensure he receives care. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway knows that Jones is alive and must treat him. Hathaway decides to treat Jones for Flaze, as it is the only disease that can be treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this is a mistake because Jones is actually experiencing symptoms of Jarkis. As a result, Jones dies.

After this, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Since Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease. However, Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze as well, believing it to be the correct treatment. This is another mistake, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Young. Young is still in admissions, and since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway treats Young for Flaze, which is again a mistake. Young dies as well.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones, Ross, and Young, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at treating all patients, fulfilling the goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, even if the results were tragic.
