In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market, having just attacked the Merchant and bought the Medicine using the coin she robbed from Tom. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit already has the Medicine and has robbed Tom, she can now focus on securing her coins.

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp and take the coins from the chest. This action ensures that she has the maximum amount of coins, fulfilling her goal.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to the Bandit achieving her objective of carrying as many coins as possible.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"]
}
``` 

This plan is concise and effectively leads to the Bandit achieving her goal with just one action.
