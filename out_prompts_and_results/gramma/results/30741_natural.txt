To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the merchant.** This action is necessary because the bandit wants to rob the merchant of her coin, which will help the bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins. The merchant is not armed with a sword, making her vulnerable to the bandit's attack.

2. **The bandit loots the merchant's coin.** After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit will take the coin from her. This action directly benefits the bandit but also indirectly helps the merchant because the bandit will now have fewer coins in the chest at the bandit camp, which could lead to a potential confrontation later.

3. **The hero attacks the bandit.** The hero, armed with the guard's sword, will attack the bandit to protect the merchant and reclaim the stolen coin. This action is crucial for the hero to help the merchant and also to eliminate the bandit threat.

4. **The hero loots the bandit's coin from the bandit’s corpse.** After defeating the bandit, the hero will take the coin that the bandit had stolen from the merchant. This action allows the hero to return the coin to the merchant, thus helping her achieve her goal.

5. **The hero gives the coin back to the merchant.** This final action ensures that the merchant has the coin back, fulfilling her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal.

The sequence of actions ensures that the merchant ends up with her coin, while the hero successfully protects her and eliminates the bandit threat.
