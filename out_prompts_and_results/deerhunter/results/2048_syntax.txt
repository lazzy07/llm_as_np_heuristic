To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money, and he has the means (a loaded rifle) to do so.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and potentially find Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba will use his rifle to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the possible endings.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but aligns with Bubba's hunger and completes the narrative of him taking advantage of the situation.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: Bubba's greed compels him to take the clerk's money, and he has a loaded rifle to intimidate the clerk.
- **go**: Bubba needs to move to a different location after committing the theft to avoid capture.
- **shoot**: Bubba's goal of eliminating Bambi aligns with his actions in the forest, fulfilling the condition of Bambi being dead.
- **eat**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and completes the story, showing the consequences of his greed and actions.
