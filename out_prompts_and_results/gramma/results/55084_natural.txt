The bandit, having just attacked the hero and killed them, sees an opportunity to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. She decides to loot the hero's corpse to take the medicine and the merchant's sword. 

Next, the bandit approaches the merchant, who is still at the market, and robs her of the hero's coin that she is carrying. With the coin now in her possession, the bandit returns to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins in the chest.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. The bandit loots the hero's corpse to take the medicine and the merchant's sword. (This action is necessary for the bandit to gain valuable items and potentially use the sword later.)
2. The bandit robs the merchant of the hero's coin. (This action allows the bandit to increase her coin count without becoming a criminal, as the merchant is not armed.)
3. The bandit walks back to the bandit camp to store her coins in the chest. (This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.)

The final story is as follows:

1. The bandit loots the hero's corpse, taking the medicine and the merchant's sword.
2. The bandit then robs the merchant of the hero's coin.
3. Finally, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp to store her coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

  "plan": [
    "loot the hero's corpse",
