**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is currently in Admissions.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C. (This action assigns Jones to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess him.)
3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C. (Hathaway needs to assess Jones in his newly assigned room.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. (This allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C. (Assuming Jones has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.)
6. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A. (Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is in Admissions.)
7. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. (This allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms.)
8. Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A. (Assuming Young has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.)
9. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B. (Hathaway needs to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room A.)
10. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. (This allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms.)
11. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B. (Assuming Ross has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is necessary to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients effectively. 
- The sequence starts with Hathaway moving to Admissions to admit Jones, allowing for the treatment of all patients.
- Assessing each patient is crucial to determine their symptoms and provide the correct treatment.
- The treatment actions are based on the assumption that all patients have Flaze, which is a reasonable assumption given the context and the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
