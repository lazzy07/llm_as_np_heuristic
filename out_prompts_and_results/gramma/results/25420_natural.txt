To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is necessary because the merchant wants to ensure the bandit is dealt with, allowing her to operate freely without the threat of being robbed or attacked. By reporting the bandit, she can help the guard eliminate the criminal threat.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to respond to the merchant's report and confront the bandit. This action is essential for the guard to fulfill his duty of eliminating criminals.

3. **The guard attacks the bandit.**  
   - The guard, armed and aware of the bandit's criminal nature, will attack to eliminate the threat. This action is crucial for the merchant's safety and allows her to continue her business without fear.

4. **The guard loots an item from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - After defeating the bandit, the guard will loot the bandit’s coin. This action is necessary for the guard to collect the coins that the bandit had, which can then be transferred to the merchant.

5. **The guard walks to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to return to the crossroads to meet the merchant and potentially give her the coins he looted from the bandit.

6. **The guard gives the coins to the merchant.**  
   - This final action allows the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity herself.

By following this sequence, the merchant successfully increases her coin collection while remaining within the bounds of legality.
