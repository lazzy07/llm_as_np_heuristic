**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that both Jones and Young are still in the admissions room, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C to ensure all patients are being attended to. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, which allows for proper assessment and treatment.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still manageable (2), there is no risk of making a mistake.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This action is crucial for Ross's health.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. Since Young is now in an exam room, he can be properly evaluated.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This action ensures Young's health as well.

By the end of these actions, both Ross and Young are treated correctly, and Jones, who is still alive and healthy, is satisfied with the care provided.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, which aligns with Dr. Hathaway's goal of keeping all patients healthy.
- The sequence of admitting Young, assessing Ross, treating him, and then assessing and treating Young ensures that all patients receive the necessary care without overloading Dr. Hathaway.
