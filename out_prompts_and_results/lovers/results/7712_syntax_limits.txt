In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item they have (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has given Alex the flowers (I1), but Alex has put them down in the living room (R22). Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I2) to be happy, but they are not happy either. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the flowers (I1) from the living room (R22) where they were put down. This action will make Alex happy because they will have the item they want.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the living room. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:

- at(C1) = R22
- at(C2) = R22
- at(C3) = R22
- at(I1) = R22 (now held by C1)
- at(I2) = R21
- at(I3) = R22
- happy(C1) = True (Alex is now happy)
- happy(C2) = False
- happy(C3) = False

Now, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R22)"]
