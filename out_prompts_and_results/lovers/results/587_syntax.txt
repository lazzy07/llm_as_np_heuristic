To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates and needs to be in the right location to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to achieve their own happiness.

3. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room. This is necessary to interact with Alex.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Alex. This is necessary because Alex needs to be happy, and Casey is willing to help Alex achieve that.

5. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and Casey.

6. **tell(C3, C1, I1, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the flowers. This is a strategic move to ensure Alex knows what Blake wants, which is important for their relationship.

7. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the bedroom where the flowers are located. This is necessary for Alex to obtain the flowers.

8. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This is the final action that ensures Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making them happy.
