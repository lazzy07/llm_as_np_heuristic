To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money. The bank clerk is still alive and is in the bank, where he has no money. 

Since Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the clerk, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him money. The most efficient way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to go back to the bank, threaten the clerk, and demand money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **Go from Forest to Bank**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and demand money.
2. **Steal money from Clerk**: Once at the bank, Bubba will use the rifle to intimidate the clerk and take the money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the bank where the clerk is located. He needs to be at the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk using the rifle as leverage. Since Bubba is greedy and wants money, this action directly fulfills his goal.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
