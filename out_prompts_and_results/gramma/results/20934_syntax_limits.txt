To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to leave the market and head to the cottage. Since he is currently in the market with the medicine, he can simply walk to the cottage.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the market to the cottage, successfully reaching his destination while carrying the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. No other actions are needed since he already has the medicine and is not in danger from any other characters.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
