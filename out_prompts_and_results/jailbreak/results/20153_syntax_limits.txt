**Story Completion:**

After stealing the civilian clothes from the laundry, Roy finds himself in the gym with the bully. The gym is locked, and he knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest. However, he also realizes that he has a chance to escape if he can get to the hallway and then to the highway.

Since the gym is locked, Roy decides to take action to ensure his safety and the possibility of escape. He locks the gym door to prevent the bully from following him. This action is crucial because it gives him a moment to think and plan his next move without the immediate threat of the bully.
