To ensure Alex achieves their goal of obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to have the flowers in order to give them to Alex, which will make Alex happy.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to fulfill Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but allows Blake to pursue their own goal of obtaining the chocolates.

4. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but allows Casey to potentially interact with Blake regarding the chocolates.

5. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to achieve their own goal of obtaining the chocolates.

6. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to make Casey happy, which is also part of Blake's goal.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.
