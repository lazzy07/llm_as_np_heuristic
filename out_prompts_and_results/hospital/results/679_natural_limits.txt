Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assessed and treated. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, this assessment is crucial to understand Jones's condition better.

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Similar to Jones, Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms. This assessment is necessary to gather information about Ross's health.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats both Jones and Ross with antibiotics, believing they might have Flaze due to the unknown symptoms. Since both patients are alive, they survive the treatment. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated two patients, and with Young in Patient Room B, Hathaway can now assess and treat Young as well. 

In summary, the actions taken are essential for Dr. Hathaway to achieve the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unknown symptoms.
