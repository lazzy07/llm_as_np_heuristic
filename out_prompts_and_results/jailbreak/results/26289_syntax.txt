**Story Completion:**

After successfully disguising himself in civilian clothes on the highway, Ernest knows he must act quickly to escape the prison. He has the pack of cigarettes, which he can use to negotiate with Roy later, but right now, his priority is to get out.

1. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Ernest decides to escape from the prison while he is disguised. This action is crucial as it allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and free, away from the threats of the bully and the prison environment.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The only action taken by Ernest is to escape. Since he is already on the highway and disguised, this is the most direct route to achieving his goal of being alive and free. There are no other actions needed because he has already completed the necessary preparations (stealing the civilian clothes and the cigarettes).
