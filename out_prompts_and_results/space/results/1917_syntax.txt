To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with it and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is taken to explore the cave, which may provide a safe haven for both Zoe and the Lizard, further solidifying their friendship.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe will again make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in their new environment.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard.
