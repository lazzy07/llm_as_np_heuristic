To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** 
   - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the Surface where the volcano is located to trigger its eruption and to interact with the Lizard.

2. **Zoe begins to make peace with the Lizard.**
   - Since Zoe is now on the Surface and the Lizard is also there, this action allows them to start building a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **The volcano erupts.**
   - This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement for the volcano to erupt, leading to a character's death.

4. **Zoe dies due to the eruption.**
   - This is the outcome of the eruption, fulfilling the condition of a character dying.

5. **The Lizard, witnessing Zoe's efforts to make peace, feels a sense of loss and resolves to honor their friendship.**
   - Although Zoe dies, the Lizard recognizes the bond they were forming, which solidifies their friendship in spirit.

The final sequence of actions leads to the desired outcomes: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the Lizard acknowledges their friendship with Zoe.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Moves Zoe to the Surface to interact with the Lizard and be present for the eruption.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Initiates the friendship process between Zoe and the Lizard.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the next action.
- **kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)**: Represents Zoe's death due to the eruption, fulfilling the story's requirement for a character to die. 

This sequence ensures that all conditions are met while maintaining a logical flow in the story.
