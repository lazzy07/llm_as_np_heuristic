To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Young again in PatientRoomC. This is necessary because Young has been assigned to two rooms, and we need to confirm his symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Walk Ross from Admissions to PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will walk Ross to PatientRoomA to assess him. This is necessary to ensure that Ross is also treated.

7. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

8. **Treat Ross with antibiotics or steroids**: Depending on Ross's diagnosis, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate medication.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
