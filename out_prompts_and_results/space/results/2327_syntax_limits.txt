Zoe, having just made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. To ensure both her safety and the Lizard's, she decides to teleport back to her spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and plan her next steps.

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the ship, she can avoid the imminent danger and remain healthy.

After this action, Zoe is safe on her spaceship, and she can continue to build her friendship with the Lizard from a safe distance, ensuring both of their goals of health, safety, and friendship are met.
