To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to proceed.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young to understand his symptoms. This will allow Hathaway to treat all patients correctly.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics to ensure he becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat him with steroids to ensure he becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat him with steroids to ensure he becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions and their explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms, which will guide the treatment decision.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms, which will guide the treatment decision.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms, which will guide the treatment decision.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, Admissions)**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
