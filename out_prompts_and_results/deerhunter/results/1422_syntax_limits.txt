Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, finds himself in the forest with a loaded rifle. He spots Bambi, the deer, and decides to shoot her to satisfy his hunger. After successfully shooting Bambi, he eats her, fulfilling his need for food. With his hunger satisfied, Bubba now feels a sense of accomplishment and is ready to return to the bank to continue pursuing his goal of obtaining money.
