**Story Completion:**

After walking into Exam Room A, Jones finds himself in front of Dr. Hathaway, who is currently overwhelmed with a workload of three. Despite this, Jones knows he needs to be assessed to determine his symptoms. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Due to Hathaway's high workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway believes Jones is alive and healthy. Hathaway assesses Jones and mistakenly believes he has Jarkis, which is incorrect, but it leads to the next action.

2. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones does not actually have Jarkis, this treatment is ineffective. But since Jones is still alive, he remains hopeful.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After the treatment, Jones walks back to the Admissions room, where he can wait for further assistance or another assessment.

In this scenario, Jones is still alive and healthy, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy, despite the misdiagnosis.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms, which is the first step in the treatment process.
- **Treat**: Even though Hathaway makes a mistake, treating Jones is essential for his health. The treatment, although incorrect, keeps Jones alive.
- **Walk**: This action allows Jones to move to a safe space where he can wait for further help, ensuring he remains alive.
