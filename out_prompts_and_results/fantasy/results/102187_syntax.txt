To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged, and also on acquiring the treasure in the cave. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, as she has accepted Rory's proposal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is crucial for Talia to become wealthy. Since she has no money or treasure at the moment, acquiring the treasure is the only way to fulfill her desire for wealth.

- **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, getting married will make both of them happy. Talia's happiness is directly linked to her relationship with Rory, and marriage solidifies that bond.

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
