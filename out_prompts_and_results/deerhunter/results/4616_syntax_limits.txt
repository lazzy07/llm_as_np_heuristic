To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on ensuring Bubba retains the money he has.

Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest with the rifle and has just shot Bambi. He is hungry, and while he has some money, he may want to eat to satisfy his hunger. However, since the goal is to ensure Bubba has the money or Bambi is dead (which is already the case), we can conclude the story without any further actions.

Hereâ€™s the final story:

1. Bubba, having shot Bambi, is now in the forest. He has the rifle and some money. He is hungry but does not need to take any further action to achieve the goal since Bambi is already dead, and he has the money.

Thus, the story ends here, with Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- No additional actions are needed because the conditions of the story already meet the goal. Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead.
