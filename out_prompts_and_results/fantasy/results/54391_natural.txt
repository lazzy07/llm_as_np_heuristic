To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since Gargax already has the money and is hungry, the most efficient way to fulfill his desires is to obtain the treasure.

Here’s the completed story:

1. Gargax travels from the cave to the treasure location (which is still in the cave).
2. Gargax picks up the treasure.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Traveling from the cave to the treasure location:** This action is necessary for Gargax to access the treasure, which is his primary goal. Since the treasure is in the cave, Gargax does not need to move to a different location.
- **Picking up the treasure:** This action allows Gargax to achieve his goal of becoming wealthy. By acquiring the treasure, Gargax will fulfill his desire for wealth and will no longer be hungry, as he can use the treasure to satisfy his hunger.

After these actions, Gargax will have both the money and the treasure, thus achieving his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
