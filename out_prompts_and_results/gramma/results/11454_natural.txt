To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit needs to go to the market to find the guard, who is currently there. The bandit believes the guard is at the market and can be confronted there.

2. **The bandit attacks and kills the guard.**  
   - The bandit is armed and can attack the guard, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to eliminate a potential threat and take the guard's sword.

3. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse.**  
   - After killing the guard, the bandit can loot the guard's corpse to take the guard's sword and any coins the guard may have had. This increases the bandit's coin count.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - With the coins and the sword, the bandit returns to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest.

5. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
