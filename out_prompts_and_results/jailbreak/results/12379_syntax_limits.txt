After venting out to the highway, Ernest finds himself outside the prison walls. He takes a moment to catch his breath, feeling the weight of the prison life lift off his shoulders. He looks around to ensure no guards are in sight. With the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, he quickly puts them on to disguise himself.
