**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (the fever). 

2. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the incorrect treatment for his actual condition (Jarkis). As a result, Ross does not become healthy and dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now realizing she needs to assess the other patients, walks back to the Admissions room to assess Jones.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing symptoms of Flaze (the fever). 

5. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for his condition. Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess Young.

7. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing symptoms of Flaze (the fever).

8. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for his condition. Young becomes healthy.
