To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Once at the bank, Bubba loads the rifle with the ammunition he picked up earlier. This action is crucial because it prepares him to threaten the bank clerk, which is necessary for him to steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but provides a logical conclusion to his actions.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. This action fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and get the money.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Loading the rifle is essential for Bubba to threaten the clerk effectively.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Returning to the forest is a logical step after obtaining the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
