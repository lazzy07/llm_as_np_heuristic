To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, he needs to be assigned to an exam room first. However, since he is already assigned to PatientRoomC, Hathaway can assess him directly. This action is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Jones's health issue, ensuring he becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Jones)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomC. This is necessary to determine if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment decision.

2. **Treat(Jones, antibiotics)**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This ensures that Jones becomes healthy.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
