In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is also in the same room but is not happy either. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Blake to trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This way, Alex can then receive the jewelry from Blake, making Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates they have for the jewelry that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to give up the jewelry, which is what Alex wants.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action allows for the exchange of items between Blake and Casey, which is crucial for Alex to eventually receive the jewelry.
- The give action allows Blake to pass the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's goal of happiness.
