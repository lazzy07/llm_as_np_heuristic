Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Upon assessment, Hathaway confirms that Jones is experiencing Fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Hathaway returns to the Admissions room to admit Ross, who is also experiencing Fever. Hathaway assigns Ross to Patient Room B and then assesses him. Confirming that Ross has Fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics as well, curing him too.

Finally, Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young, who is experiencing Unknown symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are not clear, Hathaway decides to treat him with steroids, which is a mistake since Young does not have Jarkis. Unfortunately, this results in Young's death.

Despite the unfortunate outcome for Young, Dr. Hathaway successfully treated both Jones and Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring that the majority of patients are healthy.
