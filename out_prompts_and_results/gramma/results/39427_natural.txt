To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her preferred location where she can store her coins.

2. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Now, let's summarize the story with the actions taken:

1. The bandit, after robbing the hero and buying a sword, decides to leave the market where she has just taken the hero's coin. She walks to the bandit camp, her preferred location.
2. Once at the bandit camp, she loots the coins from the chest, successfully increasing her coin count.

The bandit now has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
