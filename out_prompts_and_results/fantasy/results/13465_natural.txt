To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Rory needs to acquire it to increase their wealth.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the village to interact with Talia and Vince, who are both there, and to ensure he can achieve his goal of happiness.

3. **Rory proposes to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant for achieving Rory's happiness, but it reinforces his commitment to Talia.

4. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Rory's happiness increases, as Talia's acceptance will make Rory feel fulfilled in his relationship.

5. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness.

6. **Rory gives the treasure to Gargax.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to fulfill Gargax's desire for wealth, which will prevent Gargax from becoming a threat to Rory and Talia.

7. **Gargax gives Rory some money in return for the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he receives money in exchange for the treasure.

8. **Rory's hunger remains at 0.**  
   - Since Rory has not taken any actions that would make him hungry, he remains not hungry.

By following these actions, Rory achieves his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
