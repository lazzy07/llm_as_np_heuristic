To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is currently in the admissions room, this action is needed to understand his condition.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential for Jones to become healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This is necessary for Young to become healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient**: This is crucial to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating each patient**: This is the final step to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.
