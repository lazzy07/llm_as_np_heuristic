**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A and confirms that Young has a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young of Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. After admitting Jones, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing that Jones has Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, but since Jones is healthy, he does not die.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room C to assess Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis as well. Again, since Ross is alive and healthy, he does not die.

With Young treated successfully, and both Jones and Ross remaining alive despite the incorrect treatments, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
