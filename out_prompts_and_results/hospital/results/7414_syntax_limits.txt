**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room B to assess Young. This is necessary to determine if Young has any symptoms that need to be treated. Since Young is currently unassigned a disease, Hathaway needs to check for symptoms to ensure they can be treated correctly.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
