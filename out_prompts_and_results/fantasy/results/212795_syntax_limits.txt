In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Given the current situation, Rory has already proposed to Talia, who accepted, which means they are now in a relationship. Rory has also picked up the treasure from the cave, which contributes to his wealth. 

To achieve his goal, Rory needs to ensure he is not hungry and that he has enough wealth. Since he is currently at the Village with Talia, he can take the following action:

1. **Travel to the Cave**: Rory can travel back to the cave to confront Gargax, who is also in the cave and is a potential threat to his wealth and happiness.
