To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. Since Young is already in Exam Room C, this action is straightforward and necessary for Hathaway to understand what treatment is needed.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Jones, who is also in Exam Room C. This will help Hathaway identify Jones's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment based on the assessment. This is necessary to ensure Jones also becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Ross from Admissions to Exam Room B**: Since Ross is currently in the Admissions room, Hathaway should admit Ross to Exam Room B to assess and treat him.

6. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After moving Ross to Exam Room B, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the assessment results, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
