In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet, both safe and healthy, but the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, the following action will be taken:

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are not currently fighting, this action can succeed.

After making peace, the volcano will erupt, leading to the death of one character. Since Zoe is in the cave and the Lizard is the guardian of the surface, the Lizard will be the one who dies when the volcano erupts.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goals of health and safety. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, agrees to be friends.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, and since the Lizard is the guardian of the surface, it is caught in the eruption and dies.

This sequence achieves the goal of making friends while also resulting in the death of the Lizard due to the eruption.
