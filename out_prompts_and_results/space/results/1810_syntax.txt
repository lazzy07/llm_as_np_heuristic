Zoe and the Lizard are both on the surface of the planet, and the situation is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to take actions that will ensure both of them can escape the danger and build a friendship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe initiates a peace agreement with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it solidifies their friendship and ensures that they are no longer enemies, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is important because it allows them to move to a safer location away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are together in a safer environment.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action demonstrates the danger that was avoided by their previous actions.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
