Roy, realizing the danger both he and Ernest are in due to the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym and cannot reach them. With the knife in hand, he sneaks through the vents from the hallway to the gym. Once inside, he confronts the bully, who is caught off guard. In a swift move, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
