He quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he can access the gym. Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. With the bully contained, Ernest then uses the knife he stole to confront the bully. In a moment of desperation, he kills the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened.
