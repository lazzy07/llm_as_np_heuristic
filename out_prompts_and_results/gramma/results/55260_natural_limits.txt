The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the camp to the market, where she sees the bandit. The bandit, being a criminal, is not concerned about the merchant's presence. The merchant approaches the bandit and offers to buy the bandit's coin from her for one of her coins. The bandit, seeing an opportunity to gain a coin without any risk, agrees to the deal. The merchant hands over one of her coins and receives the bandit's coin in return.

This action is necessary because it allows the merchant to gain an additional coin while remaining within the bounds of legality, thus achieving her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal.
