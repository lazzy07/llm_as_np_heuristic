To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must take the following actions:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Cache)**: The secret agent moves from the lobby to the cache. This is necessary because the agent needs to be in a position to confront the mastermind, who is likely to be in the office or the lobby.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Cache, Office)**: The secret agent moves from the cache to the office. This action is crucial as it places the agent directly in the office where the mastermind is likely to be.

3. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the office. This is the final action needed to ensure the mastermind is dead, fulfilling the agent's goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first move to the cache is necessary to position the secret agent closer to the mastermind's likely location.
- The second move to the office is essential as it allows the secret agent to confront the mastermind directly.
- The kill action is the culmination of the secret agent's mission, ensuring the mastermind is dead.
