**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest finds himself in the gym, where the bully is looming over him, still furious about the stolen cigarettes. Knowing he is threatened, Ernest decides to take a risk. He remembers that Roy is in the laundry room and that the knife is in the kitchen. 

**Action 1:** Ernest locks the gym door behind him to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial as it isolates the bully and gives Ernest a chance to confront him without fear of outside interference.

**Action 2:** While the bully is distracted, Ernest quickly searches the gym for any potential weapons or items that could help him. He finds nothing useful, but he knows he needs to act fast.

**Action 3:** Ernest decides to crawl through the vents to the kitchen, where he knows the knife is located. This action is necessary for him to arm himself against the bully.

**Action 4:** Once in the kitchen, Ernest retrieves the knife. This is a pivotal moment as it gives him the means to defend himself and potentially get revenge on the bully.

**Action 5:** Ernest crawls back through the vents to the gym, armed with the knife. He knows that confronting the bully is risky, but he feels he has no choice.

**Action 6:** Ernest confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation, he stabs the bully with the knife. This action is the climax of the story, as it represents Ernest taking control of the situation and overcoming the threat.

**Action 7:** The bully, now incapacitated, cannot threaten Ernest or Roy anymore. However, the commotion attracts the attention of the guards.

**Action 8:** As the guards rush in, Ernest realizes he must escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he had seen in the laundry room earlier (which Roy had left there) to disguise himself.

**Action 9:** Ernest then crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can escape from the prison. This final action ensures that he overcomes the bully's threats and secures his freedom.
