To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is about to erupt, which poses a significant danger to both characters. Therefore, Zoe must act quickly to ensure both their safety and to solidify their friendship.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to get to a safer location away from the erupting volcano.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: This action is essential because the surface is dangerous due to the impending eruption. By moving to the cave, Zoe ensures both her safety and the Lizard's safety, as they will be in a more secure location.
  
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After reaching the cave, Zoe takes the opportunity to make peace with the Lizard. Since they are no longer fighting and are in the same location, this action allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

With these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
