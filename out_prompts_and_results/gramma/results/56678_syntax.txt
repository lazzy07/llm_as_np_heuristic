To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine in his possession, and by walking directly to the cottage, he fulfills his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it allows Tom to reach the cottage, which is his goal. Since he already has the medicine, he does not need to interact with any other characters or items.
