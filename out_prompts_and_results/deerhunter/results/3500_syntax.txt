To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and wants money, while the clerk has one unit of money. Bubba is also hungry, but his primary goal is to get the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to find a safe place to keep the money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger and make use of the resources available to him.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba uses his rifle to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **go**: Bubba moves to a safe location (the house) after committing the theft.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger, which is a natural response after the stressful situation.
- **eat**: Bubba consumes Bambi, which not only satisfies his hunger but also makes use of the deer he killed earlier.
