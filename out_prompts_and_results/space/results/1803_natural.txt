1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety from the erupting volcano. Since she is not fighting with the Lizard, this action does not anger the Lizard, and it allows her to be safe while still being able to communicate with the Lizard.

2. **Zoe uses the ship's communication system to call the Lizard.** - This action is implied as Zoe can communicate with the Lizard from the spaceship. It helps maintain their friendship and allows Zoe to express her concern for the Lizard's safety.

3. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard moves to a safer location, away from the erupting surface. This action is necessary for the Lizard to ensure its own safety.

4. **Zoe teleports to the cave.** - After ensuring the Lizard is safe, Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to be together in a safe location.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make plans for future exploration.** - This action solidifies their friendship and mutual goal of exploring together safely in the future.
