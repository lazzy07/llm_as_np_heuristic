**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to walk from the camp to the crossroads. This action is necessary for her to be in a position to interact with the bandit, who has coins in the chest.

2. Upon reaching the crossroads, the merchant sees the bandit and decides to report the bandit's location to the guard. This action is crucial because it allows the guard to take action against the bandit, which could lead to the bandit being killed or incapacitated, thus allowing the merchant to safely collect coins without being labeled a criminal.

3. The guard, now aware of the bandit's location, walks from the market to the crossroads to confront the bandit. This action is necessary for the guard to fulfill his goal of eliminating criminals.

4. At the crossroads, the guard attacks the bandit, who is not armed with a sword. This action is essential as it directly leads to the bandit's defeat, allowing the guard to loot the bandit's coin from the chest.

5. After defeating the bandit, the guard loots the bandit's coin from the chest. This action fulfills the guard's goal of eliminating a criminal and allows him to collect the coins.

6. The merchant, now seeing that the bandit has been dealt with, walks back to the camp. This action is necessary for her to return to her preferred location and continue her business without the threat of the bandit.

7. Finally, the merchant sells the medicine she has to another character or uses it to gain favor, thus achieving her goal of maximizing her coins without becoming a criminal.
