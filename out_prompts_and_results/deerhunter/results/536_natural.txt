Bubba is hungry and wants to have money. To achieve his goal, he needs to get money from the bank clerk. Since he already has the rifle and the ammunition loaded, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him money. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to ensure he can take the money without any resistance. The clerk has no money and is not hungry, so he poses no threat to Bubba's goal of getting money.
   
2. **Bubba eats the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat him to satisfy his hunger. This action is included to fulfill Bubba's need to eat, as he is hungry.

After these actions, Bubba will have achieved his goal of having money (by taking it from the clerk) and will also have satisfied his hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Shooting the clerk**: This is a direct action to eliminate any threat and take the money.
- **Eating the clerk**: This satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a secondary goal.
