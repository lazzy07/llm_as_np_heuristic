**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the hallway, he knows he must act quickly to help his friend Ernest. He decides to sneak through the vents to the gym, where he believes Ernest is being threatened by the bully. 

Once in the gym, Roy sees the bully looming over Ernest, menacingly. Roy, still disguised in civilian clothes, quickly assesses the situation. He knows that if he can distract the bully, he can give Ernest a chance to escape. 

Roy shouts, "Hey! You think you're tough? Come and get me!" This catches the bully's attention, allowing Ernest to slip away unnoticed. 

With the bully distracted, Roy takes the opportunity to lock the gym door behind him, ensuring that the bully cannot follow them. 

Now, with the gym locked and the bully trapped inside, Roy and Ernest can safely make their way to the hallway. Once there, Roy helps Ernest put on the civilian clothes, disguising him as well. 

Finally, they both head to the highway, where they can escape the prison together, free from the threats of the bully.
