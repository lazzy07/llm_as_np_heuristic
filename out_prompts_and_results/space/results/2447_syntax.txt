To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to establish a friendship while ensuring their safety on the dangerous surface of the planet. The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, this action will solidify their friendship. This is essential for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with other creatures.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe can walk to the cave where the Lizard is, ensuring they are in the same location to further their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe can again affirm their friendship with the Lizard, reinforcing their bond and ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe can teleport back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety as the surface is dangerous.

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while also prioritizing her safety.
