To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market to confront the Merchant and Tom, who are both present there. This is necessary for the Bandit to interact with them and potentially rob them.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins that Tom had. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without directly attacking Tom, who is already dead.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the Merchant and moves to the Bandit Camp to store them in the chest. This final action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The sequence of actions is designed to maximize the Bandit's coin collection while avoiding confrontation with the Guard, who is also present in the Market.
