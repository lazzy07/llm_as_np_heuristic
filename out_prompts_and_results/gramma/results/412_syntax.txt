To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom will also walk to the Market, where he can potentially buy more items or interact with the Merchant.

3. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, thus increasing her coin count without committing any crime.

4. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads, where she can continue her business or prepare for her next move.

5. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will follow the Merchant back to the Crossroads, where he can now carry the medicine and potentially head back to the Cottage.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity, as she is simply buying from Tom.
