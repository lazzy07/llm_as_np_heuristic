To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants item I2 (chocolates), which is currently in the dining room (R21). 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to give them to Blake.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey will have given away the chocolates, but their happiness is not the focus here.
- Alex's happiness is not directly affected by these actions, but since Blake is happy, it indirectly supports Alex's goal of wanting Blake to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "give(C3, I2, C2, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to reach the location of the chocolates, which is essential for Blake's happiness.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, achieving Blake's happiness and aligning with their goal of wanting Alex to be happy.
