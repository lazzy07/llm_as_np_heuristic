**Story Completion:**

After admitting Ross and Jones to their respective exam rooms, Hathaway realizes that Young is still in the admissions room without an assigned exam room. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway decides to admit Young to exam room C.

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where they can be assessed and treated. By admitting Young, Hathaway increases their workload to 3, but this is a necessary step to ensure that all patients receive care.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Ross is crucial to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway then assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify his condition and provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms and provide the necessary treatment.
