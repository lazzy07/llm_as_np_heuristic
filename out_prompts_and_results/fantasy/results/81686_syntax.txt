To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the cave, and Gargax can eat him to fulfill this need. This action also eliminates a potential threat to Gargax, as Rory is a human who might interfere with Gargax's plans.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can now pick up the treasure that is located in the cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

With these two actions, Gargax achieves both of their goals: they are no longer hungry after eating Rory, and they become wealthy by acquiring the treasure.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth by acquiring the treasure.
