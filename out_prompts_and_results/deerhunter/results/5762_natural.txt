To achieve Bubba's goal of having 1 money, the story can be completed as follows:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the bank where he can interact with the clerk and potentially take more money.

2. **Bubba decides to get money.**  
   - This action aligns with Bubba's goal of wanting to have money. He is motivated to take action to achieve this.

3. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate any opposition and take the clerk's money. This is a direct action to achieve his goal.

4. **Bubba eats the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk as he is hungry. This action is not directly related to the goal of having money but fulfills Bubba's hunger.

5. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After the clerk is dead, Bubba can take the money from the clerk, which fulfills his goal of having 1 money.

The final story is as follows:

Bubba, after feeling hungry, decides to go back to the bank to get more money. He confronts the clerk and, with the rifle loaded, shoots the clerk to eliminate any threat. Afterward, he eats the clerk to satisfy his hunger and then picks up the money from the clerk's body, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba decides to get money.",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk.",
    "Bubba eats the clerk.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger.
