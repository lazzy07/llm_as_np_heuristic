To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can obtain from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and obtain money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire for wealth.
