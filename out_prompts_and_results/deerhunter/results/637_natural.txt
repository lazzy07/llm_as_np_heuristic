To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and demand money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk, which will eliminate the threat and allow him to take the money without resistance.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money that the clerk had, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action ensures that Bubba can take the money without any opposition.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
