To achieve the goal of the Secret Agent, who wants the Mastermind to be dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Office to the Lobby. This is necessary to get closer to the Mastermind, who is believed to be in the same location.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Courtyard)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Courtyard. This action is taken to position the Secret Agent in a location where they can confront the Mastermind.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Dropbox)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Courtyard to the Dropbox. This is a strategic move to create distance from the Mastermind while still being able to return to the Lobby.

4. **move(SecretAgent, Dropbox, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Dropbox to the Headquarters. This action is taken to create a diversion and to prepare for the final confrontation.

5. **move(SecretAgent, Headquarters, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent returns to the Lobby, where the Mastermind is believed to be. This is the final approach to confront the Mastermind.

6. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind in the Lobby. This is the ultimate goal of the Secret Agent, ensuring that the Mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that the Secret Agent can confront and eliminate the Mastermind without being detected or interrupted.
