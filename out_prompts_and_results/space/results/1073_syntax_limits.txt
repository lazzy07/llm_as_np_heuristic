In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe, wanting to make friends with the Lizard, decides to teleport down to the surface to engage with the Lizard.

1. **Action: teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary for her to approach the Lizard and attempt to establish a friendship.

2. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes an effort to befriend it. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. 

3. **Action: erupt(Surface)** - As Zoe and the Lizard are making peace, the volcano erupts. This action fulfills the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting, and since Zoe is on the surface, she is caught in the eruption.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully teleports to the surface and makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship just before the volcano erupts, leading to her demise. This outcome highlights the unpredictability of their environment while still achieving the goal of friendship.
