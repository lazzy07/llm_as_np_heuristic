To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R21)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex (C1) to obtain the flowers they want, while Blake also gets an item they desire (chocolates).

2. **give(C1, I1, C3, R21)**: After the trade, Alex (C1) will give the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3). This action is included because it ensures that Casey is happy with the flowers, which is also important for Alex's happiness since they want Casey to be happy.

3. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Finally, Blake (C2) will give the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1). This action is included to ensure that Blake is also happy, as they want Alex to be happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers they want, making them happy. 

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R21)**: Blake trades chocolates for flowers with Casey. This allows Alex to get the flowers they want.
2. **give(C1, I1, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey, ensuring Casey's happiness.
3. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake gives chocolates to Alex, ensuring Blake's happiness.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
