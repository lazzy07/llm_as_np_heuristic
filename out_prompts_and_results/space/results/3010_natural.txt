Zoe and the Lizard are at the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. Since they are friends, they can work together to ensure their safety and health. The goal is for both Zoe and the Lizard to find a safe place away from the danger of the surface.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location quickly, as the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, Zoe can ensure her safety and health.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to help the Lizard, as they are friends and she wants to ensure the Lizard's safety as well.

3. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - Zoe leads the Lizard to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps both characters achieve their goal of being healthy and safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they will work together to stay safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave until the danger passes.** - This action is implied as they remain in the cave, ensuring their health and safety until the surface is no longer dangerous.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also ensuring the Lizard is safe and healthy. They both become closer friends through their shared experience.
