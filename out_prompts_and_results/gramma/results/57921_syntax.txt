To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where Tom is located. This is necessary for the Bandit to confront Tom and potentially rob him.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of the coin he has just purchased from the Merchant. This action is crucial for the Bandit to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads after robbing Tom. This is necessary to move back to a safe location where the Bandit can store the coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from Tom and places them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This final action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins by robbing Tom and storing the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
