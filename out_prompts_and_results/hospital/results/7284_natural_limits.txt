Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the hospital. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross, who is currently in Patient Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** This action allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway will need to make a decision based on the information available.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.** Given that Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to treat Ross without making a mistake. The treatment with antibiotics is appropriate for Flaze, which has a symptom of fever. If Ross has Flaze, he will become healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.** This action allows Hathaway to return to Admissions to assess and treat the other patients.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, ensuring he is healthy. The story is complete with Hathaway achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.
