To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying coins. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count, as Tom is currently a criminal and vulnerable to being robbed since he is armed but not in a position to defend against the Bandit.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the most critical action for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. Since Tom is already a criminal, he is an easy target for the Bandit.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a safe location where she can store her coins without the risk of being attacked by the Guard or any other character.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action secures the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, ensuring her success.
