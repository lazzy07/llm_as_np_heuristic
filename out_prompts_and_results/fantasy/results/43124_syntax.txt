To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire wealth and happiness while avoiding hunger. The following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory will travel from the Cave to the Village to be with Talia and Vince, where he can interact with them and potentially gain wealth.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory will take the money from Vince, as Vince is currently in the Village and has the money. This action will make Rory wealthy.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Since Rory has already accepted Talia's proposal, they can now get married. This will make both Rory and Talia happy.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by taking the money from Vince). He will not be hungry, as there are no actions that lead to hunger in this sequence.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Rory to move to a location where he can interact with Talia and Vince.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Rory to acquire wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness through marriage.
