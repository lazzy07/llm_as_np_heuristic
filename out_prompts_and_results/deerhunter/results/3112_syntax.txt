To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to steal from the bank clerk. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to intimidate the clerk into giving up the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to acquire the money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and heads back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to get away from the scene of the crime and to potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Now in the forest, Bubba sees Bambi and decides to shoot her. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the goals of the story.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba decides to eat her. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but adds to the narrative of Bubba being a hunter and fulfilling his hunger.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire money without violence against the clerk, as he uses the threat of his loaded rifle.

- **shoot**: This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, which is one of the story's goals.
