To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential target.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - Bubba has a loaded rifle and is hungry. By shooting Bambi, Bubba can obtain food, which satisfies his hunger. Although this action does not directly lead to obtaining money, it is a necessary step for Bubba to survive and potentially use Bambi's body to barter or gain leverage.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - After killing Bambi, Bubba decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal of obtaining money.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to obtain money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. This action directly achieves Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba first satisfies his hunger and then confronts the clerk to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
