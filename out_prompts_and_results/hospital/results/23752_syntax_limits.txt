**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he has Flaze or with steroids if he has Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly impacts Jones's health and aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young also receives the correct treatment based on his condition.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate medication based on his symptoms. This ensures that both Jones and Young are healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.

- The second action (treating Jones) is critical as it directly affects his health outcome.
- The third action (assessing Young) is necessary to ensure that Young's condition is also addressed.
- The fourth action (treating Young) is vital to ensure that both patients are healthy, which is Hathaway's ultimate goal.
