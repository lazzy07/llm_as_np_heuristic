To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to solidify their friendship and ensure their safety on the dangerous surface of the planet. Since they are already on the surface and have made peace, the next step is to ensure they can both be safe from the dangers of the environment, particularly the erupting volcano.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Zoe achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the dangers of the surface.
2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe location.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their friendship in a safe environment. It solidifies their bond and ensures they are both committed to being friends.
4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports to the spaceship from the cave. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety and health, as the spaceship is a secure environment.
5. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Cave, Ship)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship as well. This action ensures that both characters are safe and can continue their friendship in a secure environment.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
