Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have just made peace with each other, solidifying their friendship. 

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the eruption and remain healthy.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting. Since Zoe has teleported to safety, she avoids the danger, but the eruption signifies the peril of the surface.

3. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard, now alone on the surface, realizes the danger and decides to retreat to the cave for safety. This action reinforces the Lizard's desire to be safe and healthy.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully avoids the eruption, while the Lizard escapes to the cave, ensuring both characters remain healthy and safe. Their friendship remains intact, as they have made peace before the eruption.
