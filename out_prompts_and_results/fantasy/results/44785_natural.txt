To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and it will lead to Rory's death. Although it seems counterintuitive, this action will allow Rory to take the money from Vince's body later, which is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

2. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince needs to come to the cave to be in the same location as Rory's dead body, allowing Rory to take the money from him.

3. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body**: After Gargax eats Rory, Rory can take the money from Vince, which will make Rory wealthy.

4. **Rory becomes happy**: With the money taken from Vince, Rory can now be considered wealthy, fulfilling their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions in the story:

1. Gargax eats Rory (Rory is dead).
2. Vince travels from the village to the cave.
3. Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.
4. Rory becomes happy.
