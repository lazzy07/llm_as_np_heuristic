To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want (I3), the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room to be closer to Casey and Blake, who are currently in the living room.
2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to follow Alex, as they want to be near their friends.
3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake also moves to the dining room to join Alex and Casey.
4. **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for happiness.
5. **put_down(C2, I3, R12)**: Casey puts down the chocolates in the dining room, but this action is unnecessary since they have already given them to Alex.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have received the item they wanted (I3). 

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- The first three moves are necessary to gather all characters in the same room, allowing for interaction.
- The give action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for happiness by providing them with the item they want.
