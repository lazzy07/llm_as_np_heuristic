To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The clerk has money but is at the bank, and Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - Bubba is hungry and wants to eat. Since Bambi is alive and in the same location, Bubba can shoot Bambi to potentially eat her.
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and also results in Bambi being dead.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, satisfying his hunger.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bambi is dead, which meets one of the ending conditions. Bubba does not acquire money from this sequence, but he fulfills his hunger, which is also a goal.

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba wants to eat, and shooting Bambi is a direct way to achieve that.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** This action directly results in Bambi being dead, which is one of the required outcomes.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a secondary goal.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to shoot Bambi",
    "shoot and kill Bambi",
    "decide to eat Bambi"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the conclusion of the story with Bambi being dead, fulfilling the requirement of the ending.
