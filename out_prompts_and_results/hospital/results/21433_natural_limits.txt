Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, assesses Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of confusion. After assessing Young, Hathaway discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates the presence of Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis, successfully making Young healthy.
