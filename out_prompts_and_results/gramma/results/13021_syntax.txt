To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit will walk from the cottage to the crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with other characters.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob the merchant, taking the coins that Tom had just bought from her. This action is possible because the merchant is not armed with a sword, making her vulnerable to robbery.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has the maximum amount of coins possible.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- The bandit starts at the cottage and needs to move to the crossroads to interact with the merchant and Tom. This is necessary to find an opportunity to acquire coins.
- By robbing the merchant, the bandit can gain coins without needing to kill anyone, which aligns with her goal of acquiring coins while avoiding unnecessary violence.
- Finally, taking the coins from the chest at the bandit camp ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin collection, fulfilling her goal.
