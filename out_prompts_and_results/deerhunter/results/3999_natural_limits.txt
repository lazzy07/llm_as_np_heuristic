To achieve the goal of having Bubba end up with the money or ensuring Bambi is dead (or both), we can take the following action:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and since Bambi is already dead, he can eat her. This action also indirectly reinforces the fact that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

This single action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger, and since Bambi is already dead, it confirms that she remains dead. However, it does not directly give Bubba the money, but it does fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi:** This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and Bambi is available as a source of food. Since Bambi is already dead, this action is valid and helps to ensure that Bambi remains dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's conclusion.
