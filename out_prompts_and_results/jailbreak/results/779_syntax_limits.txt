**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Ernest knows he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He decides to crawl through the vents to the gym, where the bully is currently engaged in his recreation time. 

Once inside the gym, Ernest finds the bully distracted. He takes out the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. This act not only eliminates the threat to both him and Roy but also allows them to regain control over their situation. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now safely return to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Once disguised, he can escape from the prison through the highway, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
