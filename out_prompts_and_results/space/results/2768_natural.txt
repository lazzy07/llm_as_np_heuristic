Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to the planet he guards. The Lizard, feeling the urgency of the situation, decides to walk to the cave to confront Zoe.

Once at the cave, the Lizard and Zoe find themselves face to face. The Lizard, still feeling threatened, attempts to stun Zoe. However, Zoe, understanding the Lizard's intentions, manages to break free from the stun. Instead of retaliating, Zoe chooses to make peace with the Lizard, explaining her desire to be friends and to work together to ensure their mutual safety.

The Lizard, realizing that Zoe is not a threat but rather a potential ally, agrees to be friends. They both decide to leave the cave and head back to the surface together to address the erupting volcano. However, as they reach the surface, the volcano erupts violently, and the Lizard, unable to escape in time, is caught in the eruption and dies.

This story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying, and two characters making friends before the tragic event. The actions taken were necessary to show the progression of their relationship from enemies to friends, while also leading to the inevitable eruption of the volcano.
