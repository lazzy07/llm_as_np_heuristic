To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the camp and needs to move to the crossroads to interact with the merchant and Tom.

2. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The merchant is already at the camp and will walk to the crossroads to meet the bandit.

3. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob the merchant, taking the coins from her. This action is possible because the bandit is armed and the merchant is not.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will take the coins to the chest at the camp, ensuring that the coins are secured in her possession.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions are necessary for the characters to be in the same location (the crossroads) to facilitate the robbery.
- The robbery action is crucial as it allows the bandit to acquire coins from the merchant without any risk of retaliation since the merchant is unarmed.
- Finally, taking the coins to the chest at the camp secures the bandit's goal of having coins in her possession.
