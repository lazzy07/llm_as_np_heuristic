The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and knowing that the merchant has the medicine, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads, where she knows the hero is present. The bandit then reports her location to the guard, who is at the market. The guard, believing the bandit is at the camp, is misled and does not take action against her. 

With the guard distracted, the bandit returns to the camp, where she can safely collect the coins from the chest. This action fulfills her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
