In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is I1 (the flowers). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R22) and has I3 (the jewelry). Casey (C3) is in the dining room (R21) and has I1 (the flowers). Blake (C2) is in the bathroom (R12) and has put down I3 (the chocolates).

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I3) they have for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake will still be unhappy as they do not have the chocolates (I2).

This single trade action is sufficient to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
