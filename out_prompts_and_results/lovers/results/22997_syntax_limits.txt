In the current situation, Alex (C1) is already happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey (C2) is not happy because they want the item I2 (chocolates), and Blake (C3) is also not happy because they want the item I3 (flowers). 

To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I2, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R21). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want.

This single action is sufficient to achieve Alex's goal of making Casey happy, as it directly addresses Casey's desire.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C1, I2, C2, R21)**: This action is necessary because it allows Alex to fulfill Casey's desire for chocolates, thus making Casey happy. Since Alex is already happy, this action aligns with their goal of ensuring Casey's happiness.
