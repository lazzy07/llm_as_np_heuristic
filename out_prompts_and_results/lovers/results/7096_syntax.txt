To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3), the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C2, R21, R11)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R11) to be closer to Casey and Alex, who are both in the living room.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R11)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R11). This action is crucial because Casey wants the chocolates to be happy.

3. **move(C3, R11, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R11) to the bathroom (R22) to be in a different room after receiving the chocolates.

At this point, Casey is happy because they have received the item they wanted (I3 - jewelry). 

### Explanation of Actions:
