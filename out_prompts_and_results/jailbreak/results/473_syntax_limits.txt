Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure his pack of cigarettes. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and the gym door is locked, which gives him a moment of respite. 

To protect himself and his friend Roy, Ernest takes the following action:

1. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: Ernest goes to the laundry room and puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner, which is essential for his escape plan.

Now disguised, Ernest can safely move towards the highway without the threat of the bully or the guards recognizing him.

With this single action, Ernest achieves his goal of being alive and not threatened, while also securing the pack of cigarettes he stole earlier.
