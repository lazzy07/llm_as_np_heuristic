To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface, which is a dangerous location. This action is crucial because it places Zoe in the path of the volcano's eruption.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in the death of any characters on the surface. Since Zoe is now on the surface, she will be affected by this eruption.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: After the eruption, we need to ensure that the Lizard and Zoe have made peace. This action solidifies their friendship, which is a key goal for both characters.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the volcano's eruption, creating a dangerous situation.
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Moves Zoe to the surface, where she will be caught in the eruption.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in Zoe's death.
- **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their goal of making friends.

The final outcome is that the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the Lizard and Zoe become friends (in spirit, as Zoe has died).
