In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Hathaway on Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Hathaway on Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. 

3. **Walk Jones to Admissions**: After being treated and becoming healthy, Jones will walk to the admissions room to check on the status of the other patients, ensuring he is aware of their conditions and can support them.

Now, let's outline the actions and their purposes:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: This action is crucial to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.
   
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: This action will treat Jones for Flaze if he has a fever, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **walk(Jones, PatientRoomC, Admissions)**: This action allows Jones to move to the admissions room, where he can be aware of the other patients and their conditions, fulfilling his goal of being alive and healthy.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Jones, PatientRoomC, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Jones is assessed, treated correctly, and then able to check on the other patients, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
