To achieve the goal of the U.S. Army having the Ark and the Nazis being dead, the following actions will take place:

1. **Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the U.S. Army.** 
   - Explanation: Indiana Jones wants the U.S. Army to have the Ark, and since he currently possesses it, he can simply give it to them. This action directly fulfills the goal of the U.S. Army obtaining the Ark.

2. **The U.S. Army opens the Ark.**
   - Explanation: The U.S. Army believes that Indiana Jones has the Ark and that it is in the USA. Since the Ark is dangerous, opening it will result in the U.S. Army's demise. However, since the goal is to ensure the U.S. Army has the Ark and the Nazis are dead, this action will lead to the U.S. Army's death, but it is necessary to fulfill the story's requirements.

3. **The Nazis remain dead.**
   - Explanation: The Nazis are already dead from their previous action of opening the Ark. This state remains unchanged and is part of the final outcome.

The final outcome is that the U.S. Army has the Ark (as they received it from Indiana Jones), and the Nazis are dead (as they opened the Ark and died).
