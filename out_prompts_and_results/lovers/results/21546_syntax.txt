To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can see that Casey (C3) is holding the chocolates (I2) and is not happy. Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1), but Blake (C2) is not happy because they have the jewelry (I3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey can trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) remains happy with the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) will now have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy because they have traded for an item they want.
- Casey (C3) will now have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.

This single trade action is sufficient to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: This action allows Casey to give Blake the chocolates they have in exchange for the jewelry. This is the only necessary action to ensure Casey's happiness, as it directly addresses their desire for the jewelry.
