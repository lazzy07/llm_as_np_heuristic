Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both needs. He goes to the bank where he knows the clerk has money. Since he has a rifle and ammunition, he loads the rifle to prepare for a potential confrontation. 

Next, Bubba decides to steal the money from the bank clerk, using the loaded rifle as leverage. The clerk, seeing the rifle, is intimidated and hands over the money without a fight. Bubba now has the money he desires.

Finally, Bubba, still feeling hungry, decides to eat something. He goes to the forest where he knows Bambi is. However, since Bambi is alive and Bubba has no intention of harming her, he simply leaves the forest with the money he stole from the clerk.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)** - This action is included to show Bubba's movement after acquiring the money, even though he does not harm Bambi.
