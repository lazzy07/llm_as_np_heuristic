**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C to manage the patient load effectively. This action increases her workload to 2 but allows her to assess and treat patients more efficiently.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross. She finds that Ross is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Since her workload is still manageable, she correctly identifies the disease and treats Ross with antibiotics. This treatment successfully makes Ross healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room A to assess Jones, who is still in Admissions. She finds that Jones is experiencing a fever as well, indicating he also has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, making him healthy too.
