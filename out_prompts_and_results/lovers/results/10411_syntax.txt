To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but is included to maintain the flow of the story and keep Alex in a room where they can interact with Casey and Blake.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey. This action is included to ensure that Casey is happy, as Casey wants the item I2 (the chocolates) and is currently unhappy.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to be with Alex and Casey. This action is included to allow Blake to interact with the other characters.

6. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates. This action is included to inform Casey about what Blake wants, which is necessary for the next steps.

7. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be with Alex and Blake. This action is included to allow Casey to interact with the other characters.

8. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Blake. This action is included to ensure that Blake is happy, as Blake wants the item I1 (the jewelry).

9. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates with Blake for the jewelry. This action is included to ensure that both characters achieve their goals.

10. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry back to Alex. This action is included to ensure that Alex is happy, as they now have the item they wanted.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the jewelry, which makes them happy.
