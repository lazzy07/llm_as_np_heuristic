To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure.** - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Rory needs to acquire it to increase his wealth.
2. **Rory travels to the village.** - Rory needs to go to the village to meet Vince, who has the money. This is essential for Rory to become wealthy.
3. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** - This action allows Rory to gain the money that Vince possesses, fulfilling his goal of becoming wealthy.
4. **Rory and Talia get married.** - Since Talia is already married to Rory, this action is not necessary for Rory's happiness but reinforces their bond.
5. **Rory and Talia celebrate their marriage.** - This action is implied as a result of their marriage, contributing to Rory's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Rory picks up the treasure to increase his wealth.
2. Rory travels to the village to meet Vince and acquire the money.
3. Rory takes the money from Vince to fulfill his goal of being wealthy.
