To ensure Casey achieves their goal of obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Casey to access the items in the dining room, specifically the flowers and chocolates, which are believed to be there.

2. **Casey picks up the flowers in the dining room.**  
   - Casey needs to pick up the flowers to potentially trade them later, as they are aware that Alex wants the flowers.

3. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Casey needs to return to the living room to interact with Alex and Blake, who are both there.

4. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey can make Alex happy, which may lead to a favorable exchange.

5. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey in the living room.**  
   - Since Alex is now happy with the flowers, they are willing to give the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's goal.

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of obtaining the jewelry while also considering the happiness of Alex.
