In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, but their relationship is currently strained. To achieve her goals, Zoe needs to take actions that will help her connect with the Lizard while also ensuring her safety.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to reach out to the Lizard to establish a friendship. Since they are not fighting, this action can help improve their relationship. This is a crucial step because Zoe wants to make friends, and the Lizard also desires the same.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where the volcano erupts, leading to a character's demise. Since the Lizard is on the surface, it will be affected by the eruption.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption kills the Lizard, who is on the surface when the volcano erupts. This action is included to ensure that the story ends with a character dying, as required.

The sequence of actions leads to Zoe making peace with the Lizard, which fulfills her goal of making friends, but unfortunately, the Lizard dies due to the eruption. This outcome highlights the tragic nature of their friendship, as they were unable to connect fully before the disaster struck.
