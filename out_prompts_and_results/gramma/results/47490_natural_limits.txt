The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She knows that the merchant is dead and that the guard is present but distracted. The bandit quickly walks from the market to the crossroads, where she knows the hero is located. 

Once at the crossroads, the bandit attacks the hero, who is unarmed and unable to defend himself. The bandit successfully kills the hero and loots the hero's coin. With this coin, the bandit now has a total of three coins, which she can take back to the bandit camp and store in the chest.

This action sequence is minimal and directly leads to the bandit achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
