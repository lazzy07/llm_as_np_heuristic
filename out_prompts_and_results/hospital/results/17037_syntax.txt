To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because understanding the symptoms is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Young.

4. **Treat Jones with steroids**: If Jones is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Ross also receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy as well.
