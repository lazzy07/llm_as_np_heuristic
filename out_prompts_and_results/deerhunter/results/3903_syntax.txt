To complete the story, Bubba needs to achieve his goal of getting money. Since he is currently in the forest with a dead Bambi, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger, which will allow him to focus on his greed for money. After eating, he can go to the bank to steal the money from the bank clerk, who is still alive and at the bank.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to no longer be distracted by hunger, enabling him to focus on his goal of getting money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while holding the rifle. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
