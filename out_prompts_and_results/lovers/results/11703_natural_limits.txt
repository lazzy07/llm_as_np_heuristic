In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered. Alex is happy because they have the flowers, which they wanted. However, Blake is not happy because they want the chocolates, which are in the dining room. Casey, on the other hand, is not happy because they want the jewelry, which is currently with Alex.

To help Casey achieve their goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Casey gives the jewelry to Alex.** This action is necessary because it allows Casey to achieve their goal of obtaining the jewelry, which they want. By giving the jewelry to Alex, Casey can then ask for the flowers back, but since the goal is to ensure Casey is happy, this action alone suffices.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still happy with the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry.

Thus, the story concludes with Casey achieving their goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Casey gives the jewelry to Alex:** This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry. It also keeps Alex happy since they still have the flowers.
