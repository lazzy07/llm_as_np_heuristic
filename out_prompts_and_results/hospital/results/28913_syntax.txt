To complete the story, we need to ensure that all patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms, and that Hathaway's workload does not exceed three, which would lead to a mistake in diagnosis. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room C**: This will allow Hathaway to assess and treat Young, who is currently in the admissions room.
2. **Walk Young from Admissions to Exam Room C**: This action moves Young to the exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat them.
3. **Assess Hathaway Young for SymptomB in Exam Room C**: This will allow Hathaway to determine that Young has the rash, which indicates Jarkis.
4. **Treat Hathaway Young with steroids in Exam Room C**: This will treat Young correctly for Jarkis, ensuring they become healthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Young, who is currently unassigned to any exam room.
- **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Young needs to be in the exam room to be assessed and treated by Hathaway.
- **Assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomC)**: This is crucial for Hathaway to identify Young's condition accurately, ensuring the correct treatment is administered.
- **Treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: This action is essential to ensure Young receives the correct treatment for Jarkis, leading to their recovery.

After these actions, all patients will be healthy, and Hathaway will have achieved their goal.
