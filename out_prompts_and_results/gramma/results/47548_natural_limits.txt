The bandit, having just attacked and killed the hero at the crossroads, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the merchant is at the market with the medicine and that the guard is also there. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where she can find the merchant and potentially rob her of the medicine.

Once at the market, the bandit approaches the merchant, who is unarmed and unaware of the bandit's intentions. The bandit, armed with her sword, robs the merchant, taking the medicine from her. With this action, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having valuable items, as the medicine is a valuable item.

1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the merchant and attempt to rob her.
2. **Bandit robs the merchant**: This action allows the bandit to take the medicine, which is a valuable item, thus achieving her goal.
