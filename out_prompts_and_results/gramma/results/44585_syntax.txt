To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the Bandit prefers to be at the camp to achieve her goal.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action directly fulfills her goal of having as many coins as possible.

These two actions are sufficient for the Bandit to achieve her goal, as she will end up with the coins in her possession.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to reach her preferred location (the Bandit Camp) where she can access the coins.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to collect the coins, which is the ultimate goal of her character.
