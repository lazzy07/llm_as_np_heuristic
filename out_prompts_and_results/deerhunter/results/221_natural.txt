Bubba is hungry and wants to have money. To achieve his goal, he needs to get money from the bank. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to intimidate the bank clerk and ensure he can take the money without resistance.

2. **Bubba goes to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.

3. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - This action is taken because Bubba wants to take the clerk's money, and since he has a loaded rifle, he can do so without facing any opposition.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba takes the money, which fulfills his goal of having money.

5. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - Finally, Bubba is still hungry, so he decides to eat, which satisfies his hunger.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money while also addressing his hunger.
