**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Exam Room B with Ross, who has been admitted but has not yet been assessed for symptoms. Hathaway knows that Ross is alive and healthy, but needs to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B to check for symptoms. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway will determine that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross and determining he has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Ross healthy.

3. **Admit Young**: Hathaway then admits Young, who is currently in the admissions room, to Exam Room A. This action does not change Young's location but prepares Hathaway to assess Young next.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to identify Ross's condition. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.
  
- **Treat Ross**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Ross becoming healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

- **Admit Young**: This action prepares Hathaway to continue his work with another patient, ensuring that he can help Young next, which is part of his goal to have all patients healthy.
