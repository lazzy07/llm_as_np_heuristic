To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted a proposal from Vince, which means they can get married. However, Talia also needs to acquire wealth, which she can do by obtaining the treasure in the cave. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave to be closer to Talia and the treasure.
   - This action is necessary because Vince needs to be in the same location as Talia to marry her.

2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to meet Vince and also to access the treasure.
   - This action is necessary for Talia to be with Vince and to collect the treasure.

3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave.
   - This action is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy.

4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Vince and Talia get married in the cave.
   - This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of happiness, as she is now married to Vince.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure (wealth) and will be married to Vince (happiness), thus achieving her goals.
