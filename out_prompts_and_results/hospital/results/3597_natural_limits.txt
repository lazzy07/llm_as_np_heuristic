**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, decides to assess Jones, who is in the same room. 

1. **Action: Assess Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers that he is experiencing a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine the correct treatment for Jones.

2. **Action: Treat Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Jones to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

3. **Action: Walk from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   After successfully treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to check on Young, who is still waiting to be assigned to an exam room. This action is not directly related to Jones's goal but is necessary for the continuity of care for other patients.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (assessing Jones) is essential to identify his condition accurately, which is critical for effective treatment.
- The second action (treating Jones) is the direct means by which Jones can achieve his goal of being healthy, as it addresses the disease he has.
- The third action (walking to Admissions) is included to show Dr. Hathaway's ongoing commitment to patient care, even though it does not impact Jones's immediate health outcome.
