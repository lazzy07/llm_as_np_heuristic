To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary because it places Zoe in the dangerous environment where the volcano is located, setting the stage for the eruption.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action results in Zoe's death, which is a direct consequence of the volcano erupting.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action allows the Lizard to witness the aftermath of the eruption and Zoe's fate, which can lead to a moment of reflection.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe (in spirit).** - Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard can still honor their friendship and acknowledge the bond they shared, thus making peace in a symbolic sense.

This sequence of actions ensures that the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing the Lizard to maintain the friendship they had with Zoe.
