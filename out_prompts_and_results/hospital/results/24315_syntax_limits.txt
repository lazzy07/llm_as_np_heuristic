**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, as knowing the correct diagnosis is crucial for treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross also receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy, further achieving Hathaway's goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (assessing Jones) is crucial to identify the correct disease and avoid any mistakes due to Hathaway's workload.
- The second action (treating Jones) directly addresses Jones's health, ensuring he recovers.
- The third action (assessing Ross) is necessary to determine his condition and avoid misdiagnosis.
- The fourth action (treating Ross) ensures that both patients are treated correctly, leading to their recovery.
