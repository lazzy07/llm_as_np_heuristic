Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having made peace and become friends. They both recognize the danger of the erupting surface and decide to work together to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there’s a way to prevent further eruptions or help any creatures that might be in danger. 

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** - This is a natural consequence of the story's setting, and it adds urgency to the situation. 

3. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the ship.** - Zoe realizes the danger of the eruption and quickly teleports back to the safety of her spaceship. 

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, feels a responsibility to protect the surface and its creatures, even as the volcano erupts.

5. **The volcano finishes erupting, killing the Lizard.** - This tragic event highlights the dangers of the planet and the Lizard's commitment to its safety, ultimately leading to its demise.

6. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - After the eruption, Zoe feels a sense of loss and wants to pay her respects to her friend, the Lizard.

7. **Zoe makes peace with the memory of the Lizard.** - In her heart, Zoe acknowledges the Lizard's sacrifice and vows to continue its legacy of friendship and protection for the planet.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and the lasting friendship that Zoe carries with her, ensuring that the Lizard's spirit lives on in her mission.
