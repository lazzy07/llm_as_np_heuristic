To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The bandit will rob the merchant to take the coins. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to increase her coin count, and the merchant is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will take the coins to the chest at the bandit camp. This action is essential for securing the coins in a safe location, fulfilling the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The bandit, armed with a sword, sees the merchant in the market. The merchant is unarmed and has coins. The bandit decides to rob the merchant, successfully taking the coins.
- With the coins now in her possession, the bandit walks to the bandit camp and places the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins secured.
