Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety and to foster a friendship. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the need for cooperation to survive the volcanic eruption. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to establish a positive relationship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the danger of the volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are in a safer location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now a friend, follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their new friendship and ensures they are both safe from the eruption.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the lava and ash. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions in ensuring their safety.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
