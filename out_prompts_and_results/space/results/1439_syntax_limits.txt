In this story, Zoe and the Lizard have already established a friendly relationship, but the surface of the planet is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have Zoe take a risky action that leads to her demise while maintaining the friendship with the Lizard.

1. **Zoe begins to walk towards the cave** where the Lizard is located, hoping to further strengthen their friendship and find safety from the erupting volcano. However, as she approaches the cave, the volcano erupts, and she is caught in the eruption.

2. **The volcano erupts**, which results in Zoe's death. Despite this tragic outcome, the Lizard remains safe in the cave, and their relationship is solidified as they had previously made peace.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard is preserved.
