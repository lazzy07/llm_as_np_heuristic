To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is crucial because it places Zoe in the dangerous area where the eruption will occur.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will also walk from the cave to the surface. This ensures that both characters are present on the surface when the volcano erupts.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in the death of both characters since they are on the surface during the eruption.

5. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: This action is included to signify that even in their final moments, Zoe and the Lizard have made peace with each other, solidifying their friendship before the eruption.

The final sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, resulting in the death of both characters, while also ensuring that they have made peace and become friends.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **begin_erupt** starts the volcanic activity, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk** actions move both characters to the surface, where the danger is imminent.
- **erupt** causes the volcano to erupt, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
- **make_peace** ensures that the characters have established a friendship, even in their last moments.
