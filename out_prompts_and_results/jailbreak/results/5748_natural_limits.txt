As the day progresses, Roy, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the cigarettes, which could be used as leverage. Roy quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, then sneaks through the vents to the gym. 

Once inside the gym, Roy confronts the bully, who is surprised to see him. Roy, feeling bold, uses the cigarettes as a bargaining chip. He offers the bully the pack of cigarettes in exchange for his life and Ernest's safety.
