To complete the story with the desired ending of the mastermind being dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Office to the Lobby. This is necessary because the Mastermind is believed to be in the Lobby, and the Secret Agent needs to confront them there.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Courtyard)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Courtyard. This action is taken to position the Secret Agent closer to the Mastermind, who is likely to be in the vicinity.
