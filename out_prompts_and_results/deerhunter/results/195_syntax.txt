Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest after having eaten Bambi, and he is aware that the bank clerk has money. The next logical step for Bubba is to go to the bank and steal the money from the clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have successfully stolen the money from the clerk, fulfilling his goal of becoming greedy and obtaining money.
