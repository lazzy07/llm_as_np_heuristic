**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room A, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds anyway. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to the workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, the treatment fails, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway realizes she needs to address the other patients.

3. **Walk from Patient Room A to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing her workload to 3 again.

5. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing her workload to 4.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, the treatment fails, and Ross dies.

8. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. She mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis due to her workload.

9. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, the treatment fails, and Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones, Ross, and Young, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at assessing and treating her patients, fulfilling her goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, even if the results were tragic due to her mistakes.
