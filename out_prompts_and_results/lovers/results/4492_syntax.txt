To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1, which is jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to give to Alex.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making Alex happy.
