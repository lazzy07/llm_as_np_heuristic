**Story Completion:**

After Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the U.S. Army, he realizes that the Ark is dangerous and must be secured to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The Nazis, believing that Indiana has the Ark, decide to travel from Tanis to the USA to confront him and retrieve the Ark for themselves.

1. The Nazis travel from Tanis to the USA. (This action is necessary because the Nazis need to confront Indiana Jones and the U.S. Army to achieve their goal of obtaining the Ark.)
   
2. Upon arriving in the USA, the Nazis confront the U.S. Army, demanding the Ark. The U.S. Army, believing they have the Ark, prepares to defend it. 

3. The Nazis, armed and aggressive, attempt to take the Ark from the U.S. Army by force. (This action is necessary for the Nazis to try to seize the Ark, as they believe it will grant them immortality.)

4. However, the U.S. Army, also armed, successfully defends the Ark and refuses to hand it over. The confrontation escalates, and in the chaos, the Ark is accidentally opened by one of the soldiers, leading to a catastrophic event that destroys the Nazis and the U.S. Army, but Indiana Jones survives, having foreseen the danger of the Ark.
