Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action in the forest where he encounters Bambi. Since Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he sees an opportunity. He aims the rifle at Bambi and shoots, killing her. With Bambi dead, Bubba can now eat her, satisfying his hunger.

This story is short and direct, with only two actions necessary to achieve the ending where Bubba has the money (from the bank) and Bambi is dead. The actions taken are:

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his goal of having money (as he can now eat Bambi) and to ensure Bambi is dead.
2. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a part of his goal.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Bubba shoots Bambi", "Bubba decides to eat Bambi"]
}
