To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a room where they can interact with the items.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Casey to have an item that they can potentially trade or give away.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is important for Casey to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

4. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action directly leads to Casey obtaining the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry (I3) in the living room after the trade. This action is necessary to finalize the trade and ensure that the jewelry is now with Casey.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry (I3), making them happy, while Alex will have the chocolates (I2), which they can use to make themselves happy as well.
