To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will also need to go back to the bank to get the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and continue with his plans without being hindered by hunger.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is essential for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using the rifle. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next actions.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Acquires money from the clerk, achieving Bubba's goal of getting money.
