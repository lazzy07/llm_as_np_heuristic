**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway, contemplating his next move. He knows that Ernest is still in the kitchen, threatened by the bully. Roy decides to take action to ensure both of their safety and to help Ernest escape.

1. **Roy waits on the highway.** (He needs to ensure that the coast is clear before making any moves.)
2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (He is already wearing them, so this is just a reminder of his disguise.)
3. **Roy sneaks back through the vent to the hallway.** (He needs to get back into the prison to help Ernest.)
4. **Roy moves to the gym.** (He knows the bully is there and wants to confront him.)
5. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can deal with him without interference.)
6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is necessary to eliminate the threat to both himself and Ernest.)
7. **Roy returns to the hallway.** (After dealing with the bully, he needs to regroup.)
8. **Roy goes to the kitchen.** (He needs to inform Ernest that the threat is gone.)
9. **Roy tells Ernest that the bully is dead and they can escape.** (This is the final step to ensure both of them can leave safely.)

With the bully out of the way, both Roy and Ernest can now escape together.
