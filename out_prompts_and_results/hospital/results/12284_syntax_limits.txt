### Story Completion

After assessing Jones in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by the fever (SymptomA). With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake, but since Jones is the only patient in Exam Room A, Hathaway can confidently treat Jones without error.
