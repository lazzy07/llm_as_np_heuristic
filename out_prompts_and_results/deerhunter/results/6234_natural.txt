To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to interact with the bank clerk and potentially take further actions if needed.
2. **Bubba decides to leave the bank.** - Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to interact further with the clerk or take any more actions. He can simply leave.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to be in a position where he could interact with the clerk if he needed to, but since he already has the money he wants, he can choose to leave without further conflict.
- **Deciding to leave the bank** signifies that Bubba is satisfied with his current state and does not need to engage in any more actions that could lead to conflict or complications.

Thus, Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money without needing to take any aggressive actions or further risks.
