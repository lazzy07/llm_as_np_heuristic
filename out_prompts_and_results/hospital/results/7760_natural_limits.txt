Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room, where Jones, Ross, and Young are waiting.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can begin the process of assessing and treating him. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Young is the first patient assessed.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. If Young does not have Flaze, this could lead to a mistake, but the goal is to treat him correctly.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

In this scenario, Dr. Hathaway's actions are focused on assessing and treating the patients to ensure they become healthy. The story is kept concise while still addressing the necessary steps to achieve the goal of having all patients healthy.
