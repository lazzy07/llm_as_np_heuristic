3. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Dropbox)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Courtyard to the Dropbox. This action is necessary to create a strategic advantage, as the Secret Agent can then move back to the Office where the Mastermind is located.

4. **move(SecretAgent, Dropbox, Office)**: The Secret Agent moves back to the Office. This is crucial as the Secret Agent needs to be in the same location as the Mastermind to carry out the next action.
