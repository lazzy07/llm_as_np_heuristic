To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) to be closer to Alex and the jewelry.
2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey in the living room (R22). This is necessary because Casey wants to make Blake happy, and by receiving the jewelry, Casey can then give it to Alex.
3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action ensures that Alex receives the item they want, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
