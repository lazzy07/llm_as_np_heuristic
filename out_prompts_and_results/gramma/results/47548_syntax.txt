To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can take the coins that Tom is carrying. This action directly helps the Bandit achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from Tom and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the most critical action as it allows the Bandit to gain coins without any risk of being attacked since Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move the acquired coins to a secure location, ensuring that the Bandit can keep them safe.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action secures the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, which is the ultimate objective.
