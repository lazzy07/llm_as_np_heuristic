To achieve the goal of getting Tom to the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is already at the Market, and he needs to move towards the Crossroads to eventually reach the cottage. This action is necessary to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom will walk directly to the Cottage. This action is essential as it brings him closer to his desired location.

3. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)**: Tom needs to acquire the medicine from the Merchant. Since he has already bought a sword and is at the Market, he can use one of the coins he has to buy the medicine. This action is crucial for Tom to fulfill his goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom will walk back to the Crossroads to ensure he has the medicine with him as he heads to the cottage.

5. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, completing his journey with the medicine.

The actions are structured to ensure that Tom can successfully navigate from the Market to the Cottage while acquiring the medicine he desires.
