To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero.** The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the hero who is not armed. The bandit takes the medicine from the hero, which is not the goal but is a necessary action to eliminate the hero as a threat and to gain an item.

2. **The bandit attacks the hero.** The bandit can attack the hero, who is a criminal but is currently unarmed. This action will kill the hero, allowing the bandit to loot the hero's items.

3. **The bandit loots the hero's corpse.** After killing the hero, the bandit can loot the hero's corpse to take the hero's coin. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying more coins.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** Finally, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp, where she can store the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
