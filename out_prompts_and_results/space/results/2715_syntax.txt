To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to a conclusion where the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, and the two characters make friends. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** 
   - **Action:** `make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)`
   - **Explanation:** Zoe and the Lizard are currently not fighting, and since both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends, this action aligns with their goals. Making peace will improve their relationship.

2. **The volcano erupts.**
   - **Action:** `erupt(Surface)`
   - **Explanation:** The volcano has already begun to erupt, and now it will finish erupting. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and leads to a character dying.

3. **Zoe dies due to the eruption.**
   - **Explanation:** Since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she will not survive. This fulfills the condition of a character dying.

After these actions, the story concludes with Zoe and the Lizard having made peace, but Zoe unfortunately dies due to the eruption of the volcano.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
```

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcomes of friendship and a character's demise, while adhering to the constraints of the story.
