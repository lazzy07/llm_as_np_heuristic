To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to fulfill his goal of being there with the medicine. This action moves him directly to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit, who is currently at the Crossroads, will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to remove the Bandit from the Crossroads, ensuring that Tom can safely reach the Cottage without any confrontation.

Now, Tom is at the Cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it directly moves Tom to the Cottage, where he wants to be with the medicine.
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit is not present at the Crossroads, which could potentially lead to a conflict or robbery attempt against Tom.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the Cottage with the medicine while avoiding any conflict with the Bandit.
