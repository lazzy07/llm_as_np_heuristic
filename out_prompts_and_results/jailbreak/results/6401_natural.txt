**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to escape the prison. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that Roy is still in the laundry room, unaware of the situation. 

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.**  
   - This action allows Ernest to leave the prison without being seen by the bully or the guards, as he is already threatened and needs to avoid confrontation.

2. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes on the highway.**  
   - Although he is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise and ensures he is ready for the escape.

3. **Ernest escapes from the prison.**  
   - This is the final action that allows Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free, away from the threats of the bully.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Crawling through the vents is a stealthy way to avoid the bully and guards, which is crucial since both Ernest and Roy are threatened.
- Putting on the civilian clothes is necessary for the disguise, ensuring that Ernest can blend in once he reaches the highway.
- Escaping is the ultimate goal, fulfilling Ernest's desire to be alive and free from the prison environment.
