To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to give to Casey, who wants the chocolates.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary to give Casey the chocolates.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates, and by giving them, Casey will become happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the flowers (I1). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room. This action is necessary because Casey wants the flowers, and by picking them up, Casey will become happy.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex. This is necessary for Casey to be with Alex after achieving their goal.

8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and by receiving them, Alex will become happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
