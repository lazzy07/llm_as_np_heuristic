To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where the jewelry is located (R21).
   - This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R21).
   - This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22).
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential interactions with other characters.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to check on the situation.
   - This action is included to show that Casey is aware of the surroundings and may interact with Alex.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21).
   - This action allows Blake to be present in the same room as Alex and Casey, facilitating potential interactions.

At this point, Alex has the jewelry, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy. The story ends here as Alex has achieved their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is crucial for Alex to reach the item they want.
- The second action is the key moment where Alex obtains the jewelry, making them happy.
- The subsequent moves of Casey and Blake are included to maintain the narrative flow and show the dynamics between the characters, but they do not affect Alex's happiness.
