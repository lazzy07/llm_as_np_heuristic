In this story, Zoe and the Lizard have just made peace in the cave, establishing a friendly relationship. However, the volcano on the surface is still a looming threat. To ensure the story concludes with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have the Lizard take an action that leads to this outcome.

1. **Erupt the Volcano**: The Lizard, feeling a sense of urgency to protect the cave and its newfound friendship with Zoe, decides to trigger the eruption of the volcano. This action is taken to demonstrate the Lizard's protective instincts, even if it means sacrificing itself for the greater good.

2. **The Lizard Dies**: As the volcano erupts, the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also showcasing the Lizard's commitment to its role as a guardian.
