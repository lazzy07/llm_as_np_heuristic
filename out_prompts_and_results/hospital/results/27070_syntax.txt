To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where they can be assessed and treated. It increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: This action allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is currently in Exam Room B, Hathaway can assess them without any issues.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: This action allows Hathaway to confirm Ross's symptoms, which have already been assessed as SymptomA.

4. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for SymptomA**: Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will treat him correctly, ensuring he becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: This action allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms after admitting him to Exam Room C.

6. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment for their symptoms**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them correctly, ensuring they become healthy.
