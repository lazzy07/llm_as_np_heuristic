Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She knows that the Lizard is on the surface and is in danger. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, she decides to take action.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe calls out to the Lizard, expressing her concern for its safety and her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard while also showing her care for its well-being.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the surface to join the Lizard. This action is necessary for Zoe to be physically present with the Lizard, allowing them to bond and solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe again expresses her desire to be friends with the Lizard, reinforcing their connection. This action is important as it helps to ensure that their relationship improves and that they can work together for mutual safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, they can work together to find safety. This event is included to show the urgency of their situation and the need for cooperation.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard quickly walk back to the cave, where they can be safe from the eruption. This final action ensures that both characters are safe and solidifies their friendship as they escape the danger together.

By the end of these actions, Zoe has successfully made friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of their safety.
