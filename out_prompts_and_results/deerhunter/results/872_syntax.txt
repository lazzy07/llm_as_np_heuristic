To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just eaten Bambi, and is aware that the bank clerk has money. The next logical step for Bubba is to go to the bank and steal the money from the clerk, as he is greedy and wants to acquire wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will pick up the money from the clerk. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba, having just eaten Bambi, feels satisfied but is still driven by greed. He decides to go to the bank to get money.
2. He travels from the forest to the bank.
3. Upon arriving at the bank, he sees the clerk and picks up the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money.
