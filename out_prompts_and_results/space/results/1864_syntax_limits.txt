In this story, Zoe is currently safe aboard her spaceship, while the Lizard is in the cave on the planet's surface. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe's goal is to make friends with the Lizard, but their relationship is currently strained, as the Lizard believes Zoe is not a friend.

To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, Zoe will take the action of teleporting back to the surface. This action will put her in danger due to the erupting volcano, but it will also allow her to confront the Lizard directly and attempt to make peace.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, allowing for the possibility of making peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of forming a friendship with the Lizard.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. This action fulfills the requirement of having a character die, as Zoe will be caught in the eruption.

The story concludes with Zoe dying in the eruption, but before that, she successfully makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship, albeit too late for her own safety.
