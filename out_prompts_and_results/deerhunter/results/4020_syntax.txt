To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and shot Bambi, but he is still hungry and has only one dollar. The bank clerk is still alive and has no money. 

To achieve his goal, Bubba can take the following actions:

1. **Go to the Bank**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **Steal from the Clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to return to the bank to confront the clerk. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the bank to steal the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the clerk and steal the money. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining more money.

After these actions, Bubba will have successfully stolen the money from the clerk, fulfilling his goal of becoming greedy and obtaining more money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
