To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be treated for his condition.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is also in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room C. This allows Hathaway to treat Jones for his condition.

5. **Treat Young in Exam Room A**: Since Young is already in Exam Room A and has been assessed with SymptomB, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomB (which is assumed to be Flaze, given the context).

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room B**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room B, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms assessed earlier.

7. **Treat Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones in Exam Room C based on the symptoms assessed earlier.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.
