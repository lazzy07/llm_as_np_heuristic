To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit loots the corpse of the merchant to take the hero's coin. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to acquire coins to fulfill her goal. The merchant is dead, and the bandit can take the coin that the merchant has.

2. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the coins in her camp, which is part of her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **The bandit loots the corpse of the merchant.** 
   - This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, increasing her total coins. The bandit needs to gather coins to achieve her goal.

2. **The bandit walks back to the bandit camp.**
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her newly acquired coins in her camp, ensuring that she has coins in her possession or in the chest at the camp.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins by looting the merchant and returning to her camp.
