Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze due to the high workload. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Young's actual condition is unknown. However, since Young is alive, they survive the treatment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room B. After admitting Ross, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B, discovering that Ross has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway correctly treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room C. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Despite the mistakes made due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring that at least some patients are healthy.
