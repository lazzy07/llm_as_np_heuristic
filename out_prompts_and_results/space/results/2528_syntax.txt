To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the safety of her spaceship and walk to the surface, where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to bring Zoe and the Lizard into the same location, allowing for potential interaction.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard, sensing Zoe's presence, walks from the cave to the surface to confront her. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are in the same location for the next actions.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard attempt to make peace with each other. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of their goals.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption that will lead to a character's demise.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action is the culmination of the previous actions, resulting in a character dying.

In this sequence, Zoe and the Lizard successfully make peace before the eruption, allowing them to become friends. However, the eruption ultimately leads to the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
