To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to meet the Lizard. This is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: If the peace is successful, the Lizard will walk to the cave, indicating a willingness to engage further with Zoe. This action shows that the Lizard is open to friendship and collaboration.

4. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe follows the Lizard to the cave, reinforcing their new friendship and ensuring they are both in a safe location away from the dangers of the surface.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe can solidify their friendship further, ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy in their new relationship.

This sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
