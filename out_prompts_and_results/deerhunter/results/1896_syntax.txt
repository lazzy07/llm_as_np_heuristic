To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, who is now dead. Bubba is also hungry and has decided to get money. The bank clerk is still alive and is at the bank, where he has some money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary because the clerk has the money that Bubba desires.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he will shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba will decide to eat, as he is hungry. This action is necessary for Bubba to address his hunger after the confrontation.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, who is dead. This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and get the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba picks up the money from the bank after shooting the clerk.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat because he is hungry.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
