To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to make peace and become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface**: This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the surface where the Lizard is located, as they need to interact to resolve their conflict and achieve their goals.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard begin to fight**: This action is included to create tension and conflict between the two characters, which is a common narrative device. However, it is not the ultimate goal, as they will need to resolve their differences.

3. **Zoe stuns the Lizard**: Stun is used here to temporarily incapacitate the Lizard, allowing Zoe to take control of the situation and initiate a conversation about peace.

4. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: After stunning the Lizard, Zoe takes the opportunity to communicate and express her desire to be friends. This action is crucial for achieving their mutual goal of friendship.

5. **The volcano erupts**: This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character's demise.

6. **The Lizard dies**: As a result of the eruption, the Lizard is killed. This fulfills the condition of a character dying while also allowing for the previous actions to have a meaningful impact on the story.

The final sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and the establishment of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)",
    "attack(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "stun(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Brings Zoe back to the location of the Lizard for interaction.
- **Attack**: Initiates conflict, setting the stage for the stun and subsequent peace.
- **Stun**: Temporarily incapacitates the Lizard, allowing Zoe to negotiate.
- **Make Peace**: Resolves the conflict and establishes a friendship.
- **Erupt**: Causes the volcano to erupt, fulfilling the story's requirement.
- **Kill**: Represents the consequence of the eruption, resulting in the Lizard's death. 

This sequence ensures that all conditions are met while maintaining a coherent narrative.
