1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a different room to facilitate the next steps.

5. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the jewelry.

6. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake for the jewelry (I1). This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want.

7. **put_down(C3, I1, R22)**: Blake puts down the jewelry (I1) in the living room. This is necessary for the trade to be completed.

8. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the living room. This final action ensures that Alex has the item they want, making them happy.
