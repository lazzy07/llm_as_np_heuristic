To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.** - Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By traveling to the cave, he can access the treasure, which will help him achieve his goal.

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure at the cave.** - This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, increasing his wealth.

3. **Gargax travels back to the village.** - Gargax returns to the village with the treasure, where he can interact with Talia and Rory.

4. **Gargax eats Talia.** - Gargax, who does not care about happiness, will eat Talia, which will eliminate her from the story and allow Rory to focus on his goals without Talia's influence.

5. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body.** - Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money, increasing his wealth further.

6. **Rory picks up the treasure from Gargax.** - Rory can now take the treasure from Gargax, which will make him wealthy.

7. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's dead body.** - Rory can also take the money from Vince, ensuring he has both wealth and the means to satisfy his hunger.

At this point, Rory has achieved his goals of being happy (due to his marriage to Talia), wealthy (by acquiring both the treasure and the money), and not hungry (as he has the means to satisfy his hunger).

### Explanation of Actions:
- Gargax's actions are motivated by his desire for wealth and to not be hungry.
- Rory's actions are focused on acquiring wealth and ensuring he is not hungry, which he achieves by taking items from Gargax and Vince.
