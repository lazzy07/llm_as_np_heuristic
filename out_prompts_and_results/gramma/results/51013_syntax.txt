To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to fulfill his goal. This action moves him to the Cottage.

Now, let's break down the reasoning behind this action:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This is the only necessary action for Tom to achieve his goal. He is already carrying the medicine, and by walking to the Cottage, he will be at the desired location with the medicine in hand.

Since Tom's goal is to be at the Cottage with the medicine, and he is already carrying it, no further actions are needed. The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) do not interfere with Tom's goal, as the Bandit is already dead, and the Merchant and Guard are at the Market.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
