To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** The bandit is armed and the merchant is not armed, allowing the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to ensure that the merchant does not have any coins or items that could be used against her.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may have.

3. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the hero's corpse.** This action is necessary because the bandit needs to increase her coin count, and since the hero is dead, the bandit can take the hero's coin without any repercussions.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her coins and ensure they are safe.

After these actions, the bandit will have achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Looting the hero's coin**: This increases the bandit's total coin count, directly contributing to her goal.
