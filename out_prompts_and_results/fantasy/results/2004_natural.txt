To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: Gargax, who is hungry and does not care about happiness, will eat Talia. This action is necessary because it removes Talia from the story, allowing Rory to focus on acquiring wealth without the complication of Talia's desires.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Talia's body**: After eating Talia, Gargax can take the money that Talia had. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy, which is a prerequisite for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave**: Gargax will then travel to the cave to access the treasure. This action is necessary for Gargax to obtain the treasure, which will further increase his wealth.

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure**: Gargax will pick up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial for Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth.

5. **Gargax returns to the village**: Gargax will return to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary to complete the cycle of acquiring wealth.

6. **Gargax eats Rory**: Finally, Gargax will eat Rory. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy his hunger, as Rory is now the only remaining human.

After these actions, Rory will not be alive, but he will have achieved his goal of being happy (through marriage to Talia), wealthy (by having the money and treasure), and not hungry (as Gargax will have eaten him).

### Explanation of Actions:
- Gargax eating Talia removes her from the equation, allowing Rory to focus on his goals without Talia's conflicting desires.
- Gargax taking the money from Talia ensures that he becomes wealthy, which is a necessary condition for Rory's happiness and wealth.
- Traveling to the cave and picking up the treasure allows Gargax to maximize his wealth.
- Returning to the village completes the cycle of actions, making it possible for Gargax to eat Rory, thus satisfying Gargax's hunger.
