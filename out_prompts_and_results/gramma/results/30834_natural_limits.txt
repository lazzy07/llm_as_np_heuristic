The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard and the hero at the crossroads. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her, she decides to take action. The bandit swiftly attacks the guard, killing him. With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now safely loot the guard's sword and take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp without fear of being caught.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit attacks the guard**: This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate the threat posed by the guard, who is actively seeking to kill criminals. By killing the guard, the bandit ensures her safety and can pursue her goal of acquiring coins.
2. **The bandit loots the guard's corpse**: After killing the guard, the bandit can take his sword, which may help her in future confrontations or provide her with more power.
3. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp**: This action is implied as the next step for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

However, since the goal is to keep the story as short as possible, we will only include the first action in the final plan.
