Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant and the bandit. The merchant has the medicine he desires, but the bandit poses a threat. To achieve his goal of getting the medicine and returning to the cottage, Tom decides to take action.

1. **Tom attacks the bandit**: Tom uses the sword he purchased from the merchant to attack the bandit, who is also at the crossroads. Since the bandit is armed but Tom is also armed, this action is valid. Tom successfully kills the bandit.

3. **Tom takes the medicine from the merchant**: With the bandit defeated, Tom turns to the merchant and takes the medicine she has. This action fulfills Tom's goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage.

With the medicine in hand and the bandit out of the way, Tom can now safely return to the cottage.
