Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. She walks to the cave where the Lizard is located and initiates a conversation, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to escape the impending eruption. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing the mutual benefit of friendship, agrees. They both leave the cave together, but as they reach the surface, the volcano erupts, and Zoe is caught in the eruption, leading to her demise.

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks to the cave to find the Lizard and initiate a conversation, which is necessary for making peace.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship that aligns with both characters' goals of safety and companionship.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, which is a critical part of the story's conclusion.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of the volcano erupting and a friendship being formed, even though it results in Zoe's death.
