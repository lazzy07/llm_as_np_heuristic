To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to get the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to have the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex. This is necessary for Casey to be present to receive the jewelry from Alex.

4. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I3) to Alex. This action is included to ensure that Casey also feels happy by giving something to Alex, fulfilling their desire to make Alex happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the bedroom (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Blake involved.

6. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the bedroom. This action is included to show that Blake is still engaged in the story, even if it doesn't directly affect Alex's happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "give(C1, I1, C3, R22)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C3, I3, C1, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "put_down(C2, I2, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to give or receive items.
- **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry.
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be present to receive the jewelry from Alex.
