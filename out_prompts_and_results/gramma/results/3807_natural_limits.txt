Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant, who has the medicine. Knowing that the bandit is at the camp and could pose a threat, Tom decides to take action. He walks from the crossroads to the market to alert the guard about the bandit's presence. 

This action is necessary because it ensures that the guard, who is armed and wants to kill criminals, can take care of the bandit, thus securing the area and allowing Tom to safely return to the cottage with the medicine.

After reporting the bandit’s location, Tom can then walk back to the crossroads, where he can take the medicine from the merchant and finally walk to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk from crossroads to market",
    "report the location of the bandit to the guard",
    "walk from market to crossroads",
    "take the medicine from the merchant",
    "walk from crossroads to cottage"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom achieves his goal while also addressing the potential threat posed by the bandit.
