To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)** - Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary because Rory needs to access the treasure to become wealthy.

After this action, Rory will be in the cave, where he can find the treasure. Since Rory is already happy (having accepted Talia's proposal), and he will not be hungry as he has not taken any actions that would make him hungry, he will achieve his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action allows Rory to move from the village to the cave, where he can potentially find the treasure. Since Rory's goal includes becoming wealthy, accessing the treasure is essential for him to achieve that.
