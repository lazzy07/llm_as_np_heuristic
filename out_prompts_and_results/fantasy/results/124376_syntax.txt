To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure while eliminating any threats to their goal. Here’s the completed story:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Talia. This action removes a potential threat to Gargax's goal, as Talia is currently proposing to Rory, which could complicate Gargax's plans. By eliminating Talia, Gargax also ensures that there is no competition for the treasure.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: After eating Talia, Gargax picks up the treasure located in the cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is now not hungry anymore after eating Talia, and since they have the treasure, they have achieved their goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

The actions taken are necessary for Gargax to achieve their goals. Eating Talia removes a competitor and allows Gargax to focus on acquiring the treasure. Picking up the treasure directly fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth, and since Gargax has eaten, they are no longer hungry.
