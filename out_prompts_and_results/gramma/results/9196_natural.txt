The story unfolds as follows:

1. The bandit, seeing the merchant at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to rob the merchant. The bandit attacks the merchant, who is not armed, and takes the medicine. This action is necessary for the bandit to acquire valuable items without risking confrontation with the guard.

2. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, carrying the medicine. This action is essential for the bandit to secure the medicine in a safe location, as the bandit prefers to be at the camp.

3. Once at the bandit camp, the bandit places the medicine in the chest, ensuring that it is now part of the bandit's possessions. This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having valuable items secured.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp by acquiring the medicine from the merchant and securing it.
