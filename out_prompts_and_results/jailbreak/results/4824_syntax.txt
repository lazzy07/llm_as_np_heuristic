**Story Completion:**

1. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**

2. **Action: vent(Roy, Highway)**  
   - Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action allows him to bypass the prison guards and reach the outside, which is essential for his escape.

3. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)**  
   - Once on the highway, Roy escapes from the prison. This is the final action that fulfills his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising is crucial because without the civilian clothes, Roy would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would not be able to escape successfully.
- The second action of venting to the highway is necessary to avoid detection by the guards and to reach the outside world.
- The final action of escaping is the culmination of Roy's efforts to achieve his goal of being alive and free.
