Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the danger around her. She knows that to achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, she needs to take action. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to walk with the Lizard to the cave, a safer location away from the dangerous surface.
