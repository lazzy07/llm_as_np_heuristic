To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location where she can store her coins.

2. **The bandit loots the coin from the chest.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Now, let's summarize the story with the actions taken:

1. The bandit, after being at the crossroads, decides to return to her camp where she can safely store her coins. She walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.
2. Once at the bandit camp, she loots the coins from the chest, successfully increasing her wealth and achieving her goal.

The bandit now has the coins in her possession, fulfilling her desire to carry as many coins as she can.
