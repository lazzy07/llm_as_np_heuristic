Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room B. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on determining their symptoms. After assessing Young, Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating that they have Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room C. Since Ross is still in admissions and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway can assign him to an exam room. After admitting Ross, Hathaway assesses him and finds that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Ross healthy.

With both Young and Ross treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
