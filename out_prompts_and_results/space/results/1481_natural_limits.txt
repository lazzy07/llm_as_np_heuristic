Zoe, realizing that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who is still on the surface and feels abandoned as the guardian of the planet. 

In response to Zoe's teleportation, the Lizard, feeling threatened by the volcano and Zoe's departure, decides to walk to the cave to confront Zoe. When the Lizard arrives at the cave, they find Zoe safe but worried about the Lizard's safety. 

Zoe and the Lizard, now face-to-face, discuss their feelings about the volcano and the dangers it poses. They realize that they both want to be healthy and safe and that they can work together to protect each other and the planet. This mutual understanding leads them to reaffirm their friendship.

The volcano erupts shortly after their conversation, but since they are now friends, they agree to help each other escape the danger. Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, and the Lizard walks to a safer area away from the eruption.
