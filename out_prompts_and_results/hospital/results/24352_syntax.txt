To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms as well, ensuring that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. This will ensure that Young also receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess Jones. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are treated.

6. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, thus achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
