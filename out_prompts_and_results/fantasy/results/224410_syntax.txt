To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she currently has no wealth.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This action is needed to get to a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially improve her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, this action will make both characters happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

4. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels back to the cave to be with Rory and Gargax, ensuring she is in the same location as the other characters.

5. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she needs to acquire money.
