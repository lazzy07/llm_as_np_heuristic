To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Given the current situation, Zoe is safe on the spaceship, while the Lizard is on the dangerous surface. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action will initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to create a dangerous situation that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface, putting herself in danger. This action is crucial because it allows Zoe to be present on the surface when the volcano erupts, which is necessary for the next steps.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, now both on the surface, take the opportunity to make peace. This action is essential for them to become friends, as they are no longer fighting.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which will lead to the death of one character. Since Zoe has just teleported to the surface, she will be caught in the eruption.

The final outcome will be that the volcano erupts, killing Zoe, while the Lizard, having made peace with Zoe, will remember her as a friend.
