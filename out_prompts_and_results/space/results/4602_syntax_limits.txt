Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they share a mutual desire to be healthy and safe while also wanting to make friends. 

To achieve her goal of ensuring safety and friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and by returning to the ship, she can ensure her safety while also planning to invite the Lizard to join her on the ship, fostering a friendship.

The action taken is:
- teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)

This action is chosen because it allows Zoe to prioritize her safety while also setting the stage for future interactions with the Lizard, which can lead to a friendship.
