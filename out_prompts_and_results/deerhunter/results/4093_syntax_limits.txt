In this story, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba is also hungry and desires money. To achieve the goal of Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can focus on Bubba's hunger and his greed.

Since Bambi is already dead, Bubba can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action does not require any additional steps and fulfills the requirement of the story.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba decides to eat Bambi, which is already dead. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to consume the animal he has killed.

This action is necessary because it addresses Bubba's hunger, and since Bambi is already dead, it does not conflict with the goal of having Bambi alive.

Now, let's summarize the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"]
}
``` 

In conclusion, the story ends with Bubba having satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi, who is already dead, thus fulfilling the requirement of the story.
