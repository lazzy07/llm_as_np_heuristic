In the current situation, the Bandit has already attacked both Tom and the Merchant in the Market, resulting in their deaths. The Bandit is now in a position to loot the items from the corpses of both characters. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit has already attacked Tom and the Merchant, the next logical action is to loot the items from their corpses.

The Bandit will loot the Merchant first to acquire the medicine and any coins she might have. After that, the Bandit will loot Tom to take any coins he has. This will ensure that the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant to acquire the medicine and any coins she might have.
2. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit loots Tom to take the coins he has.

After these actions, the Bandit will have the medicine and the coins from both the Merchant and Tom, achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting the Merchant**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to acquire the medicine and any coins, which contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
- **Looting Tom**: This action allows the Bandit to take any remaining coins from Tom, further increasing her total.
