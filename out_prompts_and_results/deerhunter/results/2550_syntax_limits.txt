To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares Bubba to either threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi, depending on his next move.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, which will result in him taking the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the Rifle**: This is a preparatory action that enables Bubba to use the rifle effectively. Without loading the rifle, he cannot shoot anyone, which is essential for achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **Shooting the Clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba being able to take the money from the clerk, thus fulfilling the requirement of the story.
