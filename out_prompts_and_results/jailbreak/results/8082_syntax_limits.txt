**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy is in the laundry room, unaware of the danger that Ernest is facing. Meanwhile, Ernest, who is in the hallway, knows that the bully is in the gym and is currently threatened by him. To ensure his safety and achieve his goal of being alive and having a pack of cigarettes, Ernest decides to take action.

Ernest quickly moves to the kitchen, where he knows the knife is located. He steals the knife, which will give him a means of defense against the bully. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway, where he can make a strategic decision.

In the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten him or Roy anymore. With the bully locked away, Ernest feels a sense of relief and safety.

Now that he has secured his safety, Ernest can enjoy the pack of cigarettes he stole earlier, fulfilling his desire to have them without the threat of the bully looming over him.
