The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She approaches the guard, who is also at the market, and reports her own location as being at the market. The guard, believing the bandit is at the market, is distracted by her presence. The bandit then swiftly robs the merchant, who is unarmed, taking the medicine from her. With the medicine in hand, the bandit returns to the bandit camp, satisfied with her haul.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit reports her location to the guard.** This action is necessary because it distracts the guard, allowing the bandit to act without immediate threat.
2. **The bandit robs the merchant.** This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring the medicine, which she can then take back to her camp.

The story is short and direct, focusing solely on the bandit's actions to achieve her goal.
