**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that he needs to ensure both he and Ernest can escape safely. 

Roy moves to the gym and locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from threatening them while they are trying to escape. 

Next, Roy confronts the bully with the knife he stole from the kitchen. In a swift motion, he kills the bully, ensuring that he can no longer pose a threat to him or Ernest. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now focus on escaping. He leaves the gym, still disguised, and heads to the highway. Once there, he takes off the civilian clothes to avoid detection and successfully escapes from the prison.
