To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Tom, Medicine, Bandit, Market)**: Tom will rob the bandit to take the medicine. This is necessary because the medicine is currently with the merchant, who is dead, and Tom needs it to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom will walk to the crossroads. This is a necessary step to reach the cottage.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the crossroads to the cottage. This completes his journey to the cottage with the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **Robbing the Bandit**: This action is essential because Tom needs the medicine to achieve his goal, and the merchant is no longer alive to give it to him.
- **Walking to the Crossroads**: This action is necessary to move towards the cottage after acquiring the medicine.
- **Walking to the Cottage**: This final action is required to reach the cottage, where Tom wants to be.
