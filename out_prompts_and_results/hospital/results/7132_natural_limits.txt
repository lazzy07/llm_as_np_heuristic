Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients currently in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3, but this is manageable for the next action.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is in Patient Room A, Dr. Hathaway can directly assess him.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** Similar to the previous action, this allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), this treatment will also make him healthy. 

By assessing both patients and treating them correctly, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
