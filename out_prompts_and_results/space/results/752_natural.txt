Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary to transition from being enemies to friends. Zoe wants to make friends with other creatures, and this is the first step towards that goal.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs naturally after Zoe and the Lizard have made peace. The eruption serves as a dramatic conclusion to the story, fulfilling the requirement of having the volcano erupt.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the surface.** After making peace, they decide to explore the surface together, which is a natural progression of their newfound friendship.

4. **The volcano finishes erupting.** This final event results in the death of one character, which is a necessary conclusion to the story.

The actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard transition from enemies to friends while also fulfilling the requirement of the volcano erupting and resulting in a character's death.
