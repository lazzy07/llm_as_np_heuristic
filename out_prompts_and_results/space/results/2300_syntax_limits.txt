In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to be safe and make friends with the Lizard, while the Lizard also desires safety and friendship. 

To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and ensuring that the characters can make peace, Zoe will take the action of walking to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, which is essential for making peace. 

Once Zoe reaches the cave, she can then make peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship. However, the volcano will erupt during this time, leading to a dramatic conclusion where the Lizard dies, but Zoe survives, having made a friend before the eruption.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - Zoe walks to the cave to meet the Lizard, which is necessary for initiating a friendship.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship just before the eruption.
3. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's demise.

This sequence of actions fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt and a character dying while also achieving the goal of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
