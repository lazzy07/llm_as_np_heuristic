1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. By moving to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate danger while still being able to communicate with the Lizard.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** The Lizard needs to find a safe location away from the erupting surface. The cave provides shelter from the volcanic activity, ensuring the Lizard's safety.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to discuss their next steps together.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to find a solution to their predicament.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard walk back to the surface together.** By walking together, they demonstrate their friendship and mutual support. They can now face the challenges of the surface as allies.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard work together to find a safe spot on the surface.** This action is crucial as they need to find a location that is not directly affected by the volcano, ensuring both of them remain healthy and safe.
