**Story Completion:**

After successfully disguising himself in civilian clothes, Roy is on the highway outside the prison. He knows that he has to escape before the guards or the bully can catch him. With the disguise on, he feels a surge of confidence. He takes a deep breath and starts running down the highway, leaving the prison behind.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: This action is crucial as it allows Roy to leave the prison. Since he is already disguised in civilian clothes, he can successfully escape without being recognized as a prisoner.

This single action is sufficient for Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free, as it directly leads to his escape from the prison.
