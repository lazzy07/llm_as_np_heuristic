In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1), but they are with Casey (C3). Alex is holding the chocolates (I2), which Casey wants. Since Alex wants to make both themselves and Casey happy, they can trade the chocolates for the flowers.

Here’s the action that will achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the chocolates they have for the flowers that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (the flowers) while also making Casey happy by giving them the chocolates they desire.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey (C3) will also be happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills Alex's objective.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
