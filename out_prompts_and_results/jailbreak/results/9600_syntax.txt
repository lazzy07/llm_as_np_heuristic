**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, while Roy is on the highway. Roy has successfully crawled through the vents and is now outside the prison. He has the pack of cigarettes and civilian clothes, which he can use to disguise himself and escape. 

**Actions Taken:**

1. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This action is necessary for him to avoid being recognized as a prisoner when he attempts to escape.

2. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: After disguising himself, Roy escapes from the prison. This is the final action that allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- The first action of disguising is crucial because without it, Roy would be at risk of being caught by the guards or other prisoners. The civilian clothes provide him with the necessary cover to blend in and avoid detection.
- The second action of escaping is the culmination of Roy's efforts. With the disguise in place, he can safely leave the prison and ensure his survival outside.
