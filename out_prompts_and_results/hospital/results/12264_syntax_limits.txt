**Story Completion:**

After walking into Exam Room B, Jones waits for Dr. Hathaway to assess him. Hathaway, already in Exam Room B, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is at 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.
