To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we can focus on the relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, which means they can get married, leading to Talia's happiness. Additionally, Vince has money, which can contribute to Talia's wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions to complete the story:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Since Talia has accepted Vince's proposal, they can get married. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

2. **pickup(Talia, Money, Cave)**: After the marriage, Talia can pick up the money that Vince has. This will make her wealthy, fulfilling her desire for wealth.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This action is crucial because Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal. Marrying Vince will make Talia happy, which is one of her primary goals. 

- **pickup(Talia, Money, Cave)**: After achieving happiness through marriage, Talia can now focus on her wealth. Picking up the money from Vince will fulfill her desire to be wealthy.

With these two actions, Talia achieves both happiness and wealth.
