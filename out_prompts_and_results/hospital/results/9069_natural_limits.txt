Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high, decides to prioritize assessing the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, as they need to determine their symptoms to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for administering the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to determine his condition and ensure he receives the right treatment as well.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make Jones healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which will make Ross healthy.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
