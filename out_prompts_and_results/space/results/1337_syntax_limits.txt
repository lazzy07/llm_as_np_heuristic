Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are healthy but feel unsafe due to the dangerous environment. Zoe wants to ensure her safety and build a friendship with the Lizard. 

To achieve her goal, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard again, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring that they can work together to stay safe on the planet. 

**Action:**

After this action, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to find a safe place on the planet or even consider moving to the spaceship, where they can be safe from the dangers of the surface.
