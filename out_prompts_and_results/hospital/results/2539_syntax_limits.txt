In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, we need to be cautious about the actions taken to avoid mistakes in diagnosis or treatment.

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding the symptoms of the patients will help Hathaway make informed decisions about treatment. 

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This continues the process of gathering information about the patients.

3. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is crucial because treating the correct disease will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young shows symptoms of Flaze (a fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to Exam Room A**: Finally, Jones will walk to Exam Room A to be assessed by Hathaway. This is necessary for Jones to receive treatment based on his symptoms.

By following this sequence, we ensure that Jones is assessed and treated correctly, leading to his goal of being alive and healthy.
