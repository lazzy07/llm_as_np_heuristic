To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to focus on the actions that will lead to his treatment without causing Hathaway to make a mistake due to an overloaded workload. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, we need to reduce it before he assesses or treats any patients.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Ross's successful treatment:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a rash, he will receive steroids for Jarkis; if he has a fever, he will receive antibiotics for Flaze. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to reduce his workload by admitting another patient. This action is not strictly necessary for Ross's immediate health but is a good practice to manage the hospital's workflow.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine her symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are being cared for properly.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are healthy, aligning with Hathaway's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: This is necessary to determine Ross's condition.
2. **Treat Ross**: This is essential for Ross to become healthy.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: This helps manage Hathaway's workload.
4. **Assess Young**: This ensures all patients are being cared for.
5. **Treat Young**: This ensures Young also becomes healthy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, the specific treatments for Ross and Young would depend on their symptoms, which would be determined during the assessment. The actions are structured to ensure that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy while also considering the overall patient care in the hospital.
