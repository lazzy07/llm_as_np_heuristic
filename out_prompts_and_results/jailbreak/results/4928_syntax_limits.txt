**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the civilian clothes that can help him disguise himself for an escape. 

Roy quickly moves from the hallway to the laundry room where he finds Ernest. He tells Ernest about his plan to escape and suggests they both put on the civilian clothes. However, they need to ensure they are not threatened by the bully. 

Roy then decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them. This way, they can safely put on their disguises without the fear of being threatened. 

Once the gym is locked, Roy puts on the civilian clothes, disguising himself. He then heads to the hallway, where he can access the highway. 

With the disguise on, Roy makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
