To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to interact with the items and characters effectively.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey also moves to the dining room. This is important as it allows Casey to be in the same room as Blake, facilitating potential trades or exchanges.

3. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This action is a strategic move to create a scenario where Casey might be willing to trade or give away the item Blake wants.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room, where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially help them achieve their goal.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the crucial action that directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
