To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely return to the cottage without being hindered by the other characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks directly from the Crossroads to the Cottage, carrying the medicine. This action is necessary as it takes Tom to his desired location with the medicine.

Now, let's explain why this action is included:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal. He is already at the Crossroads, and since he has the medicine, he can simply walk to the Cottage without any interference from the other characters.

The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) are not involved in this action, as they are either at the Market or the Bandit Camp, and their goals do not conflict with Tom's immediate action of walking to the Cottage.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the Cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal efficiently.
