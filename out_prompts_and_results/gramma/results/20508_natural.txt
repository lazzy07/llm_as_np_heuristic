The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and successfully killed her, now stands at the market with the merchant's sword and the hero's coin. The guard, who is also at the market, is unaware of the bandit's criminal actions. The banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

To achieve this goal, the bandit will take the following actions:

1. **Walk from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to transport the coins she has acquired (the hero's coin) to her camp, where she can store them safely.

2. **Put the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at her camp.

The story unfolds as follows:

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.
2. The bandit puts the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

This sequence of actions is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
