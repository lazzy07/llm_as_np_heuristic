Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room C with Ross, who has been admitted there. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. However, Hathaway needs to ensure that all patients are healthy.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision. Since Hathaway's workload is high, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to gather information.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross is diagnosed correctly, he will receive the appropriate treatment, ensuring he becomes healthy. This action is crucial for Hathaway to achieve their goal of having all patients healthy.

By following these two actions, Hathaway can effectively manage the situation despite the high workload and ensure that Ross is treated correctly.
