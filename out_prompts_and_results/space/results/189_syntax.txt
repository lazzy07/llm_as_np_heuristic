To complete the story, Zoe needs to make peace with the Lizard, as both characters want to be healthy, safe, and make friends. The eruption of the volcano adds urgency to their situation, as the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Zoe achieving her goal:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to reach out to the Lizard and propose peace. Since they are not fighting, this action can successfully establish a friendship. This is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with other creatures.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure they are both safe from the volcano. This action is necessary to demonstrate her commitment to the Lizard and their newfound friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now a friend of Zoe, follows her to the cave for safety. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures they are both in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event highlights the importance of their friendship and cooperation in ensuring their safety.
