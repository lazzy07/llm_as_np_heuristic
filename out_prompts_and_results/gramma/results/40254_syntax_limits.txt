In this story, the Bandit aims to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Given the current situation, the Bandit has already looted a coin from Tom and purchased medicine using that coin. The Bandit is now in a position to achieve her goal by taking the remaining coin from the Merchant.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs the Merchant, who is not armed, and takes the coin she is carrying. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit then takes the coins she has acquired and places them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action (robbing the Merchant) is crucial because it allows the Bandit to gain an additional coin, which is essential for her goal of accumulating wealth.
- The second action (taking the coins to the chest) is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has successfully stored her coins, thus achieving her objective.
