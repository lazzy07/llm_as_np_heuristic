In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are in the same room (R22) as Casey (C2) and Blake (C3). Since Blake (C3) has put down the flowers in R22, Alex can simply pick them up to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)** - Alex picks up the flowers that Blake has put down in the living room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
- Casey and Blake remain unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (flowers) without needing to interact with Casey or Blake further. It is the most efficient way to achieve Alex's goal of happiness.
