To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I3) they received earlier. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps to clear the space and signify that Alex is now happy with the jewelry.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to facilitate the next action.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
- **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: While this action does not directly contribute to Alex's happiness, it helps to show that Alex is now satisfied with the jewelry and no longer needs the chocolates.
