Dr. Hathaway, at the Admissions room, sees that all patients are currently in the Admissions room and decides to take action to ensure their health. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room A.**  
   - **Explanation:** This action is necessary to start the process of assessing and treating Jones, who is currently experiencing unknown symptoms. Admitting him to an exam room will allow Hathaway to evaluate his condition.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B.**  
   - **Explanation:** Similar to Jones, Ross needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment. This action is crucial for Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C.**  
   - **Explanation:** Young also needs to be assigned to an exam room. This action ensures that all patients are in a position to be assessed and treated, which is essential for Hathaway to achieve their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A.**  
   - **Explanation:** By assessing Jones, Hathaway can identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis. This is the first step towards treatment, and since Hathaway's workload is still manageable (3), he can accurately diagnose Jones.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway can treat each patient based on their symptoms, ensuring they all become healthy.
