**Story Completion:**

Blake, holding the flowers, turns to Alex and says, "I think the chocolates are in the bathroom." This is a lie, but it leads Alex to believe that the chocolates are not in the living room. 

Alex, wanting to be happy, decides to move to the bathroom to search for the chocolates. 

While Alex is in the bathroom, Blake takes the opportunity to give the flowers to Casey, who is also in the living room. 

Casey, now holding the flowers, feels happy because they have what they want. 

Blake, now without the flowers, picks up the jewelry that Alex had previously put down in the living room. 

Blake is now happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the bathroom (lie)**: This action is necessary to mislead Alex into leaving the living room, allowing Blake to make a move without interference.
   
2. **Alex moves to the bathroom**: This action is taken because Alex believes Blake's lie and wants to find the chocolates, which leads them away from the living room.

3. **Blake gives flowers to Casey**: This action is crucial as it allows Casey to be happy with the flowers, which is a side goal for Blake.

4. **Blake picks up jewelry**: This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, which they wanted.
