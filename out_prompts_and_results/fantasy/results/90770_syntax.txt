To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave where the Treasure is located. This is necessary for her to obtain the Treasure, which will contribute to her wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the Treasure. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the Village with the Treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and Vince.

4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. Since Rory has already accepted her proposal, this action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.
