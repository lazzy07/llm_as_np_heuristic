To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is hungry and greedy, and he has a rifle and ammunition. Loading the rifle is necessary for him to threaten or kill another character if needed.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and potentially steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest. This is a strategic move to get away from the bank after committing the theft.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, achieving the desired outcome.
