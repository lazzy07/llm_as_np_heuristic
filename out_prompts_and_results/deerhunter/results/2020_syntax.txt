To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he is greedy and has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
2. **Go**: Bubba will go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to confront Bambi.
3. **Shoot**: Bubba will shoot Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary to ensure Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, driven by greed and armed with a loaded rifle, decides to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain money without needing to engage in a more complex interaction.
   
2. **Go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba moves to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to reach Bambi and fulfill the second part of the ending condition.

3. **Shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, which satisfies the condition of the story's ending.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
