Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe and healthy, Zoe needs to take the following actions:

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially form a friendship.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.**  
   - Since Zoe and the Lizard are not fighting, this action allows them to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, Zoe can ensure that both she and the Lizard feel safe and healthy.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.**  
   - This action is important because it allows both characters to move to a safer location (the cave) away from the dangerous surface, ensuring their safety and health.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe and healthy.
