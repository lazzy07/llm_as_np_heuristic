To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Since Young is currently in Exam Room C, Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Young to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This is essential because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is vital for Young to recover and achieve their goal of being healthy.

By following these actions, Young will successfully become healthy, thus achieving their goal.
