To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomC to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat Jones, who is still in the Admissions room. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are taken care of, but it is not directly related to Young's goal.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment for Jones.

5. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This ensures that all patients are healthy, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

The actions taken ensure that Young is treated correctly and becomes healthy, while also addressing the needs of the other patients.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

In this plan, the first two actions focus on Young's health, ensuring they achieve their goal. The subsequent actions address the overall situation in the hospital, reflecting Hathaway's commitment to all patients.
