To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as she has already proposed to him. The quickest way to ensure Talia's happiness is for Rory to accept her proposal, leading to their marriage. Since Talia is currently in the Village and Rory is in the Cave, we will also need to ensure that Talia can access the treasure, which will contribute to her wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory accepts Talia's proposal. This action makes both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the Cave to the Village to be with Talia.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married in the Village, solidifying their happiness.

4. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave to access the treasure.

5. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the Cave, which contributes to her wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure).
