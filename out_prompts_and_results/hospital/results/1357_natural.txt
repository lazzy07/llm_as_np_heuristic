**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, noticing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze, the disease associated with that symptom. Since Jones is in Patient Room A, Hathaway administers the appropriate antibiotics.

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload decreases by one, bringing it down to one. With Jones now healthy, Hathaway can focus on the other patients.

Next, Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, as he is still in the admissions room. This increases Hathaway's workload to two again. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. However, since Hathaway's workload is now two, there is no risk of making a mistake.

Hathaway decides to treat Ross for Jarkis, as it is the only other disease available, even though Ross's symptoms are unknown. Hathaway administers steroids to Ross.

After treating Ross, Hathaway's workload decreases to one again. Ross is now healthy.

Finally, Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing the workload back to two. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis, as it is the only other disease available.

After treating Young, Hathaway's workload decreases to one, and Young is now healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
