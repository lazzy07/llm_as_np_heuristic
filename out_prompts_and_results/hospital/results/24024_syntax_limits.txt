In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in a critical situation with three patients: Jones, Ross, and Young. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat them effectively. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they attempt to assess or treat multiple patients. Therefore, the best course of action is to focus on one patient at a time.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but assessing Ross is necessary to move forward.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will make him healthy. If he has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is essential to ensure that Ross becomes healthy, which contributes to Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

By focusing on Ross first, Hathaway can manage their workload effectively and ensure that at least one patient is treated correctly.
