**Story Completion:**

After finishing their chores in the laundry, Ernest and Roy realize they need to act quickly to secure their safety and get the pack of cigarettes. Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take a risk. He sneaks out of the laundry room and heads to the kitchen to grab the knife. 

Once he has the knife, he returns to the laundry room where Roy is waiting. They discuss their options and decide that the only way to ensure their safety is to confront the bully. They know the bully is in the gym, so they make their way to the hallway. 

Ernest locks the gym door behind them, trapping the bully inside. With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation, kills him. With the bully out of the way, Ernest and Roy can now enjoy the pack of cigarettes without fear of being threatened.
