To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is already at the Camp, so she will walk to the Crossroads to interact with Tom and the Merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is possible because Tom is not armed, and the Bandit is armed with a sword.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp to secure the coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins.
