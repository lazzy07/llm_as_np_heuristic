**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, noticing that Ross is in Exam Room A, decides to assess him first. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but he believes Ross is alive and healthy. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Fortunately, Ross actually has Flaze, so he becomes healthy.

3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones.

4. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. He believes Jones is alive and healthy.
