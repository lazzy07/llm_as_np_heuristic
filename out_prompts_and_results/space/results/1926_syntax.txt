To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface, which is a key event in the story.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important because it allows Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the death of Zoe, who is now on the surface.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing for the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard to be established before the eruption.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process, setting the stage for the climax of the story.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe to the cave to interact with the Lizard, which is necessary for them to become friends.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling one of their goals.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, resulting in Zoe's death.
