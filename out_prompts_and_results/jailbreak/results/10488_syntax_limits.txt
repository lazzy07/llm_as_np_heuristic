Ernest is in the gym, feeling threatened by the bully who wants to kill him. He has just stolen a pack of cigarettes, a knife, and civilian clothes from the kitchen and laundry. To ensure his safety and achieve his goal of being alive and having a pack of cigarettes, he decides to take a bold action. 

Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside with him. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from escaping and allows Ernest to confront him without the risk of being attacked from outside. 

Next, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully. This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat to his life, ensuring he can live without fear of being harmed. 

With the bully dead, Ernest can now safely put on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This disguise will allow him to escape from the prison without being recognized. 

Finally, Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can escape from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free, as he can now leave the prison behind.
