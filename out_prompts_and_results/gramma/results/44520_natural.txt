The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, now stands at the market with the hero's coin in her possession. Her goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since she already has the hero's coin, she decides to return to the bandit camp to secure her loot.

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. (This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her camp where she can store her coins.)
2. The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp. (This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at her camp.)

With these two actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking from the market to the bandit camp**: This is essential for the bandit to transport the coin she looted from the hero to her safe location.
- **Placing the coin in the chest**: This action directly fulfills the bandit's objective of securing her loot.
