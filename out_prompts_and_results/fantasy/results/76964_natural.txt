To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: Gargax, who is at the village, is hungry and wants to eat a human. Talia is at the village, so Gargax eats her. This action eliminates Talia, who has the money, and allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Talia**: After eating Talia, Gargax can take the money from her body. This action increases Gargax's wealth.

3. **Rory travels from the cave to the village**: Rory, who is at the cave, travels to the village to confront Gargax and retrieve the treasure.

4. **Rory takes the treasure from Gargax**: Upon arriving at the village, Rory can take the treasure from Gargax, who is now wealthy but not concerned about being happy. This action increases Rory's wealth.

5. **Rory becomes happy**: With the treasure in hand, Rory feels fulfilled and happy, achieving his goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- Gargax eats Talia: Satisfies Gargax's hunger and removes Talia from the story.
- Gargax takes the money from Talia: Increases Gargax's wealth.
- Rory travels from the cave to the village: Allows Rory to reach Gargax and the treasure.
- Rory takes the treasure from Gargax: Increases Rory's wealth and fulfills his goal.
