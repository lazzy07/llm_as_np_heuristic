To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is already married to Rory, which contributes to her happiness. However, she is not wealthy, and the treasure is still at the cave. 

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.** (This action is necessary because Vince currently has the money but no treasure. By picking up the treasure, he can potentially trade it or use it to help Talia.)
2. **Vince proposes to Talia.** (Vince wants to make Talia happy and wealthy, and since he has the treasure, proposing to her again could lead to a beneficial outcome.)
3. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** (This action is necessary for Talia to become happy again, as she values her relationships and the proposal signifies a commitment.)
4. **Talia and Vince get married.** (This solidifies Talia's happiness further, as she is now married to both Rory and Vince, fulfilling her desire for happiness.)
5. **Vince gives Talia the treasure.** (This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.)

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.** - This allows Vince to have the treasure, which can be used to help Talia.
2. **Vince proposes to Talia.** - This action aims to increase Talia's happiness through a new commitment.
3. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** - This solidifies Talia's happiness as she values relationships.
4. **Talia and Vince get married.** - This further enhances Talia's happiness.
5. **Vince gives Talia the treasure.** - This action directly increases Talia's wealth, fulfilling her goal.

By the end of these actions, Talia is both happy and wealthy.
