After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain some energy. After eating, he feels more capable of going to the bank to get the money he desires. 

Next, Bubba goes to the bank, where he can confront the bank clerk. Since he is still greedy and has a loaded rifle, he decides to steal the money from the clerk. This action fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba travels to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the clerk using his loaded rifle.

Each action is necessary to achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
