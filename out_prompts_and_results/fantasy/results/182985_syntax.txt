To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. Since Talia is already married to Rory, she has achieved happiness. However, she still needs to acquire wealth. The treasure is located in the cave, and Vince has the money, which he does not care about since he does not want to be rich. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead Talia to achieve her goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Talia needs to go to the cave to get the treasure.
2. **Pick up the Treasure**: Once in the cave, Talia can pick up the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia needs to move to the cave where the treasure is located. This is essential for her to achieve her goal of wealth.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: By picking up the treasure, Talia will gain wealth, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure).

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Talia, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy in the shortest possible way.
