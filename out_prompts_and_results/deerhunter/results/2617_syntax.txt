To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene and avoid any potential consequences of his actions.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once in the forest, Bubba decides to eat. This action reflects his hunger and allows him to satisfy that need after his successful theft.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, the deer. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his hunger after the theft and ensures he has a meal.

The sequence of actions leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
