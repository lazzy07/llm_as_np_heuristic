To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Ross, and Ross has already been assessed with SymptomA, Hathaway can determine that Ross has Jarkis (the only disease that presents with a rash). This is necessary to ensure Hathaway knows how to treat Ross correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway can treat Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room A**: Young is currently in PatientRoomA with Ross. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway needs to assess Young next. Young will walk to PatientRoomA to be assessed.

4. **Assess Young**: After Young walks to PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Young**: Depending on the symptoms assessed, if Young has a fever, Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics for Flaze. This will make Young healthy.

6. **Walk Jones to Exam Room B**: Jones is currently in Admissions. Hathaway needs to assess Jones next, so Jones will walk to PatientRoomB.

7. **Assess Jones**: After Jones walks to PatientRoomB, Hathaway can assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

8. **Treat Jones**: If Jones has a fever, Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics for Flaze. This will make Jones healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
