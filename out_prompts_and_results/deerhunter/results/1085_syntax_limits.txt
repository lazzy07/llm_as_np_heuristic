To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to confront the bank clerk to obtain the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money, thus ensuring that he can take the money without any opposition.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money from the clerk. This action is the final step to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of Bubba having the money, as the clerk is killed and Bubba can take the money without any risk.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk and secure the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can take the money without any further obstacles.
