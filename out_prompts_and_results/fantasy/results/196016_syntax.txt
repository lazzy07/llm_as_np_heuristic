To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, who has accepted her marriage proposal, and the treasure that Rory possesses. The following actions will help Talia achieve her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels to the Village to be with Rory, who is currently there. This is necessary for her to solidify their relationship and access the treasure.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village to meet Talia. This is necessary for them to be together and for Talia to propose a plan to access the treasure.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action will make both characters happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness goal.

4. **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Village)**: Talia takes the treasure from Rory. Since Rory is now her husband, this action is permissible and allows Talia to achieve her wealth goal.

5. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry. This action is included to reflect her state but does not affect her goals.

6. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to reflect his state but does not affect their goals.

By following these actions, Talia will achieve her goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).
