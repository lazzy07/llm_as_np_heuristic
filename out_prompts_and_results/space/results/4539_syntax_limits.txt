Zoe, having made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface is dangerous and they both need to find a safer place. To ensure their safety and to continue building their friendship, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can plan their next steps together.

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety and to create a space where she can communicate with the Lizard without the immediate danger of the planet's surface.

This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to prioritize her safety while still maintaining the relationship she has started to build with the Lizard. By being on the ship, she can think of ways to invite the Lizard to join her in a safer environment.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)"]
}
