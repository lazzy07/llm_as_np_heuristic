**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy realizes that the bully is a significant threat to both him and Ernest. He knows he must act quickly to ensure their safety. 

1. **Roy sneaks through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to bypass the locked door and confront the bully directly, which is essential for his plan to eliminate the threat.)
   
2. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is crucial as it removes the immediate danger posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Ernest can live without fear.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now focus on helping Ernest and securing their escape.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Sneaking through the vents allows Roy to access the gym without being detected, which is necessary since the gym door is locked.
- Killing the bully is the only way to ensure that both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened, fulfilling Roy's goal of staying alive and protecting his friend.
