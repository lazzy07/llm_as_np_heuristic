To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (R22) to interact with them.
2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey, who has the jewelry. Without moving to the same room, Alex cannot interact with Casey.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is essential as it allows Casey to transfer the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
