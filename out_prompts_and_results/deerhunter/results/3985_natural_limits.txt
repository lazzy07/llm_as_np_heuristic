To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to go back to the bank. He enters the bank and confronts the clerk. Since Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he threatens the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for their life, hands over the 1 money to Bubba. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, fulfilling his goal.
