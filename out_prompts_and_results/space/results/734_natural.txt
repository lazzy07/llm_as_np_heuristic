Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have established a friendship. To achieve their goals, they need to find a safe place away from the eruption.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location quickly, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends now, and the urgency of the situation takes precedence.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface**: Zoe returns to the surface to ensure the Lizard is safe and to help them find a way to escape the danger together.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave**: The cave is a safer location compared to the surface, and since they are friends, they can work together to reach it.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard enter the cave**: Once inside the cave, they are protected from the eruption, ensuring both characters are safe and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also ensuring the Lizard is safe, thus strengthening their friendship.
