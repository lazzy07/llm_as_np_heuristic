The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her plans, she decides to attack him. The guard, unarmed against the bandit’s sword, is quickly defeated. With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now focus on her goal of acquiring coins. She loots the guard's corpse, finding a coin that she adds to her collection. 

Now, with the guard dead and the market clear, the bandit can return to her camp, where she can safely store her coins in the chest.
