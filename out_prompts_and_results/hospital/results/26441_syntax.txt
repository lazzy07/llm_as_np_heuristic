To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Young is currently in PatientRoomC, Hathaway will assess them.

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Young healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will go back to the admissions room to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine if Jones has any symptoms that need treatment.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (the fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Jones healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, making him healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly based on their symptoms, achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
