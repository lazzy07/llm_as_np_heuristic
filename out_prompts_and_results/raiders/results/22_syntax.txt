To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis are already in Tanis and need to travel to the USA where the Ark is currently located. This action is necessary for them to reach the Ark and attempt to open it.

2. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: Once the Nazis arrive in the USA, they will open the Ark of the Covenant. Since the Ark is not dangerous (as indicated by the current situation), this action will grant them immortality.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. The Nazis travel from Tanis to the USA to reach the Ark of the Covenant, which they believe is located there. This is essential for them to achieve their goal of immortality.
   
2. Upon arriving in the USA, the Nazis open the Ark. Since it is not dangerous, this action successfully grants them immortality, fulfilling their objective.

The Nazis have now achieved their goal of becoming immortal.
