In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. He has already picked up the treasure from the cave, but he is still hungry. To achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, Gargax needs to eat a human. Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money from Vince's body.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:
