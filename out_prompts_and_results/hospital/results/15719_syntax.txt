To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young in PatientRoomA**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young's recovery.

3. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomB**: After treating Young, Hathaway will need to address the other patients. Jones is currently in the admissions room, so Hathaway will walk Jones to an available exam room (PatientRoomB).

4. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomB**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. This is essential for Jones's recovery.

6. **Walk Ross from Admissions to PatientRoomC**: Finally, Hathaway will walk Ross from the admissions room to another available exam room (PatientRoomC).

7. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

8. **Treat Ross in PatientRoomC**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and well-being.
