Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve a resolution, Zoe needs to establish a friendship with the Lizard while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to transition from being enemies to friends, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event is a natural consequence of the story's setting. The eruption serves as a dramatic climax, fulfilling the requirement that the volcano erupts and adds tension to the narrative.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard both die.** This action occurs as a result of the eruption. Since the surface is uninhabitable and the volcano has erupted, both characters are caught in the eruption, leading to their demise. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

The sequence of actions leads to a resolution where Zoe and the Lizard become friends just before the eruption, creating a poignant moment of connection before their tragic end.
