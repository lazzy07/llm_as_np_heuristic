To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk from the Market to the Crossroads to reach the location where the coins are stored in the chest at the bandit camp.

2. **take(Bandit, Coin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
