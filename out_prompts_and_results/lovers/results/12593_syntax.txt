To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room (R21)**: This action is necessary because Blake wants the jewelry to be happy. Since the jewelry is in the dining room, Blake needs to move there to pick it up.

2. **Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21)**: This action is required to access the jewelry, which is located in the dining room.

3. **Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21)**: This action is crucial because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy. By giving it to Alex, Blake ensures that Alex becomes happy, which aligns with Blake's desire for Alex's happiness.

4. **Blake moves back to the living room (R22)**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's goal but helps to conclude the story with Blake in a different room.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they received the jewelry they wanted.
- Blake is happy because they successfully helped Alex.
- Casey remains unhappy, but Blake's goal is achieved.
