In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the item I3 (the item that is currently with Casey). 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story where Blake achieves their goal:

1. **move(C2, R11, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R11) to the bedroom (R12) where Alex is located. This action is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex directly.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the item I3 (which is currently with Casey) to Alex. This action ensures that Alex receives the item they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (I3), and Blake is happy because they have helped Alex achieve their happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R11, R12)**: This action is essential for Blake to reach Alex and facilitate the next action.
- **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item I3, thus achieving Blake's goal of making Alex happy.
