**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knew he had to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decided to take a risk. 

Roy crawled through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully was still enjoying his recreation time. Once inside the gym, Roy saw the bully distracted and seized the opportunity. He pulled out the knife he had stolen from the kitchen and, with a swift motion, killed the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy felt a wave of relief wash over him. He quickly locked the gym door to ensure no one could enter and threaten him or Ernest. Now, with the bully dead and the gym secured, Roy could safely return to Ernest and plan their escape together.
