**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Roy stood in the hallway, contemplating his next move. He knew that Ernest was in the cells, and the bully was in the gym, furious about the stolen cigarettes. Roy had already locked the gym door, which gave him a moment of respite from the bully's threats.

Realizing that he needed to help Ernest and ensure their safety, Roy decided to take action. He crawled through the vents to the kitchen, where he quickly grabbed the knife. With the knife in hand, he returned to the hallway and put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier. This disguise would allow him to escape if necessary.

Now disguised, Roy moved to the gym door and unlocked it, preparing to confront the bully. He knew that if he could take down the bully, both he and Ernest would be safe. With determination, Roy entered the gym, knife in hand, ready to face the bully.

In a swift motion, Roy confronted the bully and, in a moment of self-defense, killed him. With the bully out of the way, Roy could now ensure that both he and Ernest would be safe from further threats.

1. **Crawl through the vents to the kitchen**: This action is necessary for Roy to retrieve the knife, which is essential for confronting the bully and ensuring their safety.
