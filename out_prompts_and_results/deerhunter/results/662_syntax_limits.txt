After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain some energy. After eating, Bubba feels a surge of greed and decides to go to the bank to steal money from the bank clerk, who is unaware of his intentions.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This is necessary for Bubba to regain energy and continue with his plans.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba travels to the bank, where he intends to steal money. This action is essential for him to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the bank clerk at gunpoint. This action fulfills his greed and allows him to achieve his goal of acquiring money.
