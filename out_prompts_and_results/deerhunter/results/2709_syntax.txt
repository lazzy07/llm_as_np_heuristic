To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a rifle, and has already stolen it from the clerk. He is also hungry, which means he may want to eat, but his primary goal is to get money. The clerk is also at the bank and is greedy, which means he may be a target for Bubba's actions.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take all the money in the bank. This action is necessary because the clerk is greedy and could potentially interfere with Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat him since he is now dead. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is also a goal he has.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: Finally, Bubba goes back to the house. This action is necessary for him to secure his position and possibly hide the rifle and any evidence of his actions.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take all the money without any opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger after he has killed the clerk.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: Ensures Bubba can retreat to a safe location after committing the actions.
