To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) as well. This action allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating interaction.

3. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to create a scenario where Casey might be willing to trade or give the chocolates to Blake.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This is necessary for the next actions to take place.

5. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action is crucial because it allows Blake to have the item they want, which is the chocolates.

6. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Casey for the flowers (I1) that Alex wants. This is the key action that allows Alex to achieve their goal.

7. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex has the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Casey moves to the dining room to access the chocolates.
2. Blake follows Casey to the dining room to facilitate interaction.
3. Blake tells Casey about wanting the chocolates to create a potential trade scenario.
4. Casey returns to the living room to be with Alex and Blake.
5. Casey gives the chocolates to Blake, allowing Blake to have what they want.
6. Blake trades the chocolates for the flowers with Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire.
7. Blake gives the flowers to Alex, making Alex happy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C3, I2, C2, R22)",
    "trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
