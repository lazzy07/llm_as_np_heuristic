To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3, which is jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R21) to be closer to the item they want (I3, jewelry), which is currently with Alex (C1).

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the item they have (I1, which is flowers) to Alex in the bedroom. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item, which may help in the next steps.

3. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Casey for the flowers (I1). This is crucial as it allows Casey to finally obtain the jewelry they want.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) after the trade to be in a familiar space.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate the next actions.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: By giving flowers to Alex, Casey helps Alex to have an item, which may encourage Alex to trade the jewelry.
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: This is the pivotal action where Casey finally gets the jewelry they want, achieving their goal of happiness.
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: This action is simply to return to a familiar space after achieving the goal.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
