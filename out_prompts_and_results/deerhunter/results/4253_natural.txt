To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Stealing the money from the clerk:** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk is the only character with money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten or eliminate the clerk to achieve this.
- **Shooting the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to remove the obstacle (the clerk) who possesses the money. It is a direct action that leads to Bubba obtaining the money.
- **Picking up the money from the clerk:** After the clerk is incapacitated, Bubba can take the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story. Bambi is already confirmed dead, so both conditions of the ending are satisfied.
