To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave, where the treasure is located. The following sequence of actions will lead to Talia's success:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can provide her with wealth.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to go to the village to interact with Vince, who has the money, and to potentially negotiate or take the money from him.

3. **Talia proposes to Vince.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to Rory, she can propose to Vince to create a scenario where she can gain access to the money.

4. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness through the acceptance of her proposal.

5. **Talia and Vince get married.**  
   - This final action solidifies Talia's happiness and allows her to access Vince's money, thus achieving her goal of being wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Talia picks up the treasure (to become wealthy).
2. Talia travels from the cave to the village (to access Vince).
3. Talia proposes to Vince (to create a bond that allows her to access his money).
4. Vince accepts Talia's proposal (to ensure Talia's happiness).
5. Talia and Vince get married (to finalize Talia's happiness and wealth).
