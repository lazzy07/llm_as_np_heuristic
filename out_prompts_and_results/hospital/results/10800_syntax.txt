To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room. This will allow Hathaway to treat him based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Similar to Ross, Young is also in the admissions room. Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room A**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room, allowing for treatment based on his symptoms.

5. **Treat Jones in Exam Room B**: Since Jones is already in Exam Room B and has been assessed, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified.

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room C**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room C, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified during the assessment.

7. **Treat Young in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during his assessment.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated appropriately, leading to their health.
