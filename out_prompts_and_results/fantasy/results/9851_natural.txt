To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her marrying Rory and acquiring the treasure. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Gargax, wanting to be wealthy and not hungry, sees Vince as a target since Vince has the money. This action removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Rory without competition for wealth.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - With Vince out of the picture, Talia can now take the treasure that is at the cave. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **Talia and Rory become happy.** - Since Talia and Rory are already married, they can now be happy together. Talia's happiness increases as she achieves her goal of being happy.

At the end of these actions, Talia is wealthy (due to the treasure) and happy (due to her marriage with Rory), thus achieving her goals.
