To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that I2 is not in the room, but we know that Casey wants I2 and is currently unhappy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to check for the jewelry (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to find the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) with the jewelry.
   - This action is necessary to return to Blake and Alex, where the exchange can happen.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C3).
   - This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want.

5. **put_down(C3, I3, R22)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I3) they were holding.
   - This action is necessary to make room for the new item.

6. **pick_up(C3, I3, R22)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I3) again after putting them down.
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry (I2) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
