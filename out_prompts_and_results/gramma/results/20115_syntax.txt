To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coins she was carrying. This action is necessary because the Merchant is now dead, and the Bandit can take the coins without any resistance.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins she just acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, after attacking both Tom and the Merchant, is now in possession of the Merchant's sword and the coins she had. 
- She decides to rob the Merchant's coins from her corpse, as she is now the only one alive at the Crossroads.
- With the coins in hand, she walks to the bandit camp and places the coins in the chest, achieving her goal.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **rob**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire the coins from the Merchant, which is essential for her goal.
- **take**: This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that the Bandit has achieved her goal.
