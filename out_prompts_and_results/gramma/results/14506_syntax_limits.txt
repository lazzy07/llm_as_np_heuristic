In the current situation, the Bandit has already robbed Tom of his coin and purchased a sword from the Merchant. The Bandit is now in a strong position to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. The Bandit can take the remaining coins from the chest at the Bandit camp, which is her ultimate goal.

To achieve this, the Bandit will take the action to walk from the Market to the Bandit camp, where she can access the coins in the chest.

**Action Explanation:**
