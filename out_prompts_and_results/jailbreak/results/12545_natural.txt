**Story Completion:**

Day one continues with Roy in the kitchen, holding the knife and the civilian clothes. He knows that Ernest is in the gym, threatened by the bully. To help his friend and ensure their survival, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where Ernest is located.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference.)
3. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, maintaining the element of surprise.)
4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)
5. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises Roy, preparing him for a potential escape.)
6. **Roy and Ernest escape to the highway.** (With the bully dead and the disguise on, they can safely leave the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's survival while eliminating the bully's threat. Locking the gym door and crawling through the vents are strategic moves to avoid confrontation until Roy is ready. Killing the bully is the critical action that removes the immediate danger. Finally, putting on civilian clothes and escaping to the highway fulfills the goal of being alive and free.
