To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey wants to be happy and needs to be in a position to either give or trade items.

2. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Blake wants to help Alex and needs to be in the same room as Casey to facilitate a trade.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the jewelry (I1) with Blake. This action is crucial because it allows Casey to give Blake the item they want, which is the jewelry that Alex desires.

4. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake moves back to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex to give them the item.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, thus making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
