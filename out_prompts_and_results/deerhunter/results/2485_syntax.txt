To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and he is greedy and hungry. The bank clerk is also present and has money. Bambi is in the forest, alive and not directly involved in the bank scenario. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either threaten the bank clerk or to hunt Bambi later.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has. By shooting the clerk, he can take the money without any resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, and it is the shortest path to achieve the goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to be able to shoot the clerk. Without a loaded rifle, he cannot threaten or harm anyone.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money by eliminating the clerk, who is the only obstacle to getting the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money after the clerk has been shot, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.
