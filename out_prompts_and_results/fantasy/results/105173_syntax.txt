To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to gain wealth and happiness while avoiding hunger. Given the current situation, Rory is already in the Village and has accepted Talia's marriage proposal, which makes him happy. However, he still needs to acquire wealth and ensure he is not hungry.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the Cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for him to access the treasure, which will help him achieve wealth.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action is essential for him to increase his wealth.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village with the treasure. This is necessary to ensure he is in a location where he can interact with Talia and Vince.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since he has already accepted her proposal, this action will solidify their relationship and ensure Rory's happiness.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that he is not currently hungry, but it sets up the next action.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to show that Rory's journey ends here, but it is not necessary for Rory to achieve his goal since he has already married Talia and gained wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken to achieve Rory's goal:

1. Rory travels to the Cave to access the treasure.
2. Rory picks up the treasure to increase his wealth.
3. Rory travels back to the Village to be with Talia.
4. Rory marries Talia, achieving happiness.
5. Rory becomes hungry, but this does not affect his goal.
6. Gargax eats Rory, which is not necessary for Rory's goal but concludes the story.

In the end, Rory achieves his goal of being happy and wealthy, even though he is eaten by Gargax.
