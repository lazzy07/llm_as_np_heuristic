In the cave, Talia holds the treasure, while Vince has the money. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth. To achieve Talia's happiness or wealth, the following actions take place:

1. Gargax eats Vince. This action is necessary because Gargax wants to satisfy his hunger and does not care about being happy. By eating Vince, Gargax eliminates a competitor for the treasure and money, allowing Talia to potentially gain wealth.

2. Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action is crucial as it allows Talia to become wealthy by acquiring the money that Vince had. With the treasure she already possesses, Talia's wealth increases, leading to her happiness.

After these actions, Talia becomes wealthy, which fulfills her goal of wanting to be happy and wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
