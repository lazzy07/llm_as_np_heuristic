To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle and is hungry, while the bank clerk is in the bank with money. Bambi is also in the forest, and Bubba may see Bambi as a potential meal.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, being hungry and having a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi, fulfilling his hunger and also leading to Bambi's death.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and ensures that Bambi is dead.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba can go to the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba can steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is taken to eliminate Bambi, who is a potential source of food for Bubba, and it also leads to Bambi's death.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling his greed.

By following this sequence, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
