Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take decisive action. He knows he has the knife and the cigarettes, and he is locked in the gym with the bully. To ensure his survival and to eliminate the threat, he uses the knife to kill the bully. 

This action is necessary because it directly addresses the bully's threat to both Ernest and Roy. By killing the bully, Ernest removes the immediate danger and secures his own safety. 

After killing the bully, Ernest can then escape the gym, retrieve the civilian clothes from the laundry room, and disguise himself to make his way to the highway for a successful escape.
