To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba returns to the forest with the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Going to the bank** is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** is necessary to eliminate the only obstacle between Bubba and the money.
- **Picking up the money** directly achieves the goal of Bubba having the money.
- **Returning to the forest** provides a narrative conclusion to Bubba's actions.
