Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to help the Lizard, who is in peril. She teleports from the ship to the surface to warn the Lizard about the imminent eruption. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and communicate the danger of the volcano.

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and immediately warns him about the volcano. The Lizard, initially wary of Zoe, listens to her and realizes that they both want to be safe and healthy.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, aligning their goals of safety and health.

As they are talking, the volcano begins to erupt, and they both need to act quickly to escape the danger.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - This action is necessary for both characters to find safety from the eruption.

Once they reach the cave, they are safe from the eruption, and they both realize that they can work together to protect their home and each other in the future.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the previous actions, leading to the eruption while Zoe and the Lizard are safely in the cave.

In the end, Zoe and the Lizard have formed a friendship, and while the volcano erupts, they are safe together in the cave.
