**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells and is being threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to achieve his goal of being alive and free, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy sneaks back through the vent to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and ensure that Ernest is no longer threatened.)
   
2. **Roy locks the gym door behind him.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that Roy can deal with him without interference.)

3. **Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is crucial as it gives Roy the means to defend himself and eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)

4. **Roy confronts the bully and kills him with the knife.** (This is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened, allowing Roy to escape safely.)

5. **Roy then returns to the hallway and crawls through the vent back to the highway.** (This action allows him to leave the prison without being detected.)

6. **Finally, Roy puts on the civilian clothes again to ensure he is disguised.** (This is the last step to ensure his escape is successful.)

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now escape the prison without any threats looming over him or Ernest.
