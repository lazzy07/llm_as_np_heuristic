To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young based on Assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk Jones from Admissions to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will walk Jones to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is also assessed and treated, but it does not directly affect Young's goal.

4. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are taken care of, but it does not directly impact Young's goal.

5. **Treat Ross based on Assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. This ensures that all patients are healthy, but again, it does not directly affect Young's goal.

Here is the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Assess(Young)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.
2. **Treat(Young)**: This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.
3. **Walk(Jones, Admissions, ExamRoomA)**: This action is necessary to move Jones to an exam room for assessment.
4. **Assess(Ross)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.
5. **Treat(Ross)**: This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Young**: To identify the disease Young may have.
