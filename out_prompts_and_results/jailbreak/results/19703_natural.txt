**Story Completion:**

On day two, Roy is in the gym, where the bully is also present. The bully, still angry about the stolen cigarettes, threatens Roy. To protect himself and ensure his survival, Roy decides to take action. 

1. **Roy steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to defend himself against the bully.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him without interference.)
3. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing Roy to feel safe.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now focus on escaping. He puts on the civilian clothes he had previously stolen, which he can now access since the bully is no longer a threat. 

4. **Roy escapes to the highway.** (This is the final action that allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Stealing the knife is crucial for Roy's self-defense against the bully.
- Locking the gym door ensures that the bully cannot escape and that Roy can confront him without fear of being interrupted.
- Killing the bully is the only way for Roy to eliminate the immediate threat to his life.
- Escaping to the highway is the ultimate goal, allowing Roy to be alive and free.
