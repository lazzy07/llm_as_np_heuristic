To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further their friendship and ensure they are in the same location to communicate.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will again attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and solidifies their bond.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship. This action ensures her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.
