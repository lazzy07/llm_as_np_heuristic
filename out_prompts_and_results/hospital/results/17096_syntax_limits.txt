In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Young, who is showing symptoms of a disease, and Ross, who has not yet been assessed. Jones is still in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room.

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.
2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.
3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then walk to the admissions room to assess Jones, who has not yet been assigned to an exam room. This is crucial to ensure that Jones is also treated appropriately.
4. **Admit Jones**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room C, allowing for further assessment and treatment.
5. **Assess Jones Again**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms and provide the necessary treatment.

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat both Ross and Jones, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
