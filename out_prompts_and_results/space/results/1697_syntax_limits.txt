Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. 

To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, which will make the Lizard angry. This action is necessary because Zoe believes that being on the spaceship will keep her safe from the eruption. The Lizard, feeling betrayed by Zoe's sudden departure, becomes hostile.
