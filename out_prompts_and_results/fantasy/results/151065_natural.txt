To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave, where the treasure is located. The following sequence of actions will ensure Talia achieves her goal:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth to fulfill her goal of being wealthy.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to go to the village to be with Vince, who has the money, and to ensure her happiness by being with her spouse.

3. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body.**  
   - Since Talia is married to Vince, she can take the money from him. This action is necessary to combine her wealth with the treasure she has already acquired.

4. **Talia's happiness increases.**  
   - By acquiring both the treasure and the money, Talia achieves her goal of being wealthy, which contributes to her happiness.
