To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax, the dragon, wants to eat a human who is at the cave. By eating Vince, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and Vince will no longer be alive, which will lead to a change in the dynamics of wealth and happiness.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Gargax to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

3. **Gargax picks up the treasure**: Gargax can then pick up the treasure that is at the cave. This action further increases Gargax's wealth.

4. **Talia and Rory become hungry**: Since Talia and Rory are now left without Vince, they will become hungry. This action is included to show the consequences of Vince's demise and how it affects the remaining characters.

5. **Gargax becomes wealthy**: After taking the money and treasure, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy.
