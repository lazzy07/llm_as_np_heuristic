To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross** in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat Ross** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
3. **Assess Young** in Admissions to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat Young** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

### Explanation of Actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis. This is crucial because the treatment depends on the correct diagnosis. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to proceed.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to identify his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Young as well.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This action is crucial to ensure Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
