To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human, and by eating Rory, Gargax will fulfill their hunger. Since Rory is already married to Talia, this action will not affect Talia's happiness directly, but it will lead to Rory's death, which will ultimately allow Talia to focus on her own happiness and wealth.

2. **Vince takes the money from Rory's dead body**: After Rory is eaten by Gargax, Vince can take the money from Rory's body. This action is crucial because it allows Vince to become wealthy, which is one of his goals.

3. **Talia proposes to Vince**: Talia, now focused on her own happiness and wealth, proposes to Vince. This action is necessary for Talia to pursue her goal of happiness.

4. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal**: Vince accepts Talia's proposal, which leads to both characters being happy.

5. **Talia and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies the happiness of both Talia and Vince, allowing them to achieve their respective goals.

In this sequence, Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry is indirectly achieved through the actions of Gargax, Vince, and Talia. Rory's death leads to Vince acquiring wealth, and Talia's marriage to Vince fulfills her happiness.
