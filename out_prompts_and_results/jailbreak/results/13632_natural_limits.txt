**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy realizes that the bully is still in the gym and that Ernest is in the kitchen with the cigarettes. Knowing that the bully is a threat to both of them, Roy decides to take action. 

1. **Roy locks the gym door.** This action prevents the bully from coming out and threatening them further. It also gives Roy and Ernest a chance to strategize without the bully's interference.

2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the kitchen.** This allows Roy to reach Ernest without being seen by the bully. Once in the kitchen, Roy can inform Ernest of the plan to escape and help him with the knife.

With the gym locked, the bully is trapped inside, and Roy can now work with Ernest to escape safely.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Locking the gym door is crucial to ensure the bully cannot threaten them while they plan their next move.
- Crawling through the vents allows Roy to bypass the bully and reach Ernest, ensuring they can work together to escape.
