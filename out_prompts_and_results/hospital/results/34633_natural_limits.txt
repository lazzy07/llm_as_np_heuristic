Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Young is showing symptoms of Fever, decides to treat Young for Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the urgency of treating Young outweighs that risk. 

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is necessary because Young is experiencing Fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. By treating Young correctly, Dr. Hathaway can ensure that Young becomes healthy.

After this action, Young is now healthy, and Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is in Patient Room B. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still manageable, there is no risk of error in this assessment.

2. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers his symptoms are unknown. However, since Ross is in the same room as Young, Dr. Hathaway can deduce that he may also have Fever and treat him for Flaze as well.

3. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is necessary to ensure Ross also becomes healthy.

Now both Young and Ross are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated two patients.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions. 

4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers his symptoms are unknown. However, since Jones is the last patient, Dr. Hathaway can treat him for Jarkis, assuming he has a rash.

Now all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.
