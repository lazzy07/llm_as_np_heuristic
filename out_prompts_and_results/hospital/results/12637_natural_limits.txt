Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she correctly identifies that Jones is experiencing a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross and Young to their respective exam rooms. She assigns Ross to Patient Room C and Young to Patient Room B. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B, where she identifies a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. She treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

At this point, both Jones and Young are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
