Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. Knowing that the bully is locked in the gym and that Roy is still in the cells, he decides to take a risk. He crawls through the vents to reach the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself further and successfully escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Crawl through the vents to the highway**: This action is necessary for Ernest to escape the prison. Since the gym is locked and the bully is inside, this is the safest route for him to take without being threatened.
2. **Put on the civilian clothes**: Although Ernest is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise as he prepares to escape. It is crucial for avoiding detection by guards outside the prison.
