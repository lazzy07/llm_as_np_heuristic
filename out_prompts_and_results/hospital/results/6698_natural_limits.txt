Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to reach Young in Patient Room B to assess their symptoms.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is crucial to determine what symptoms Young is experiencing, which will inform the treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** (Assuming Young has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this action will ensure Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.
