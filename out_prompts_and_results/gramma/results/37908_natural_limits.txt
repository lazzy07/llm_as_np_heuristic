**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is a criminal and has just robbed the merchant, the bandit decides to take action. She approaches the hero and, with a swift move, she attacks and kills the hero, who is not armed with a sword. 

After the hero falls, the bandit loots the hero's body, taking the hero's coin and the medicine. With these items in her possession, the bandit now has coins and medicine, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Attack the Hero:** The bandit attacks the hero because the hero is a criminal and is carrying valuable items (the hero's coin and the medicine). The bandit is armed and can attack the unarmed hero, ensuring a successful outcome.

2. **Loot the Hero's Body:** After successfully killing the hero, the bandit loots the body to take the hero's coin and the medicine. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
