To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can either become friends or that one of them dies, while also incorporating the eruption of the volcano. Given the current situation, Zoe is safe on the spaceship, and the Lizard is in the cave. The surface is uninhabitable due to the eruption, and both characters believe the surface is dangerous.

Here’s a concise story that leads to the desired outcome:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the dangerous surface, where the Lizard is likely to perceive her as a threat, given their current relationship as enemies.

2. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard needs to confront Zoe, as it believes she is a danger to the planet. This action sets the stage for a potential conflict or resolution.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard begin to fight.** - This action is taken because they are enemies, and it creates tension in the story. 

4. **The Lizard stuns Zoe.** - This action allows the Lizard to gain the upper hand in the fight, preventing Zoe from acting further and creating an opportunity for dialogue or resolution.

5. **Zoe breaks free from being stunned.** - This action allows Zoe to regain her agency and respond to the Lizard, which is crucial for the next step.

6. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is essential for them to transition from enemies to friends, aligning with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

7. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** - This action concludes the story with the eruption, which is a significant event that affects both characters.

In this sequence, the characters transition from enemies to friends while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, fulfilling the conditions of the story.
