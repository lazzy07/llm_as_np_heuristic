In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy, and they are currently in the same room (R22) as Alex (C1) and Blake (C2). Alex has the jewelry, but they are not happy yet. 

To achieve Casey's goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey can trade the flowers (I1) they have with Alex for the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (jewelry) while giving Alex an item they might want (flowers). After this trade, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry.

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: This action allows Casey to give the flowers they have to Alex in exchange for the jewelry. Since both characters are in the same room, this action is valid and directly leads to Casey's happiness.
