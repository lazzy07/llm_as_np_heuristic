To achieve the goal of either Ernest or Roy overcoming the bully's threats or one of them dying, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Roy, Hall)**: Roy is currently on the highway and needs to move to the hallway to access the gym and potentially confront the bully.
2. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: By locking the gym door, Roy can prevent the bully from escaping if he decides to confront him.
3. **vent(Roy, Gym)**: Roy crawls through the vents to enter the gym, where the bully is located.
4. **revenge(Roy, Bully, Gym)**: Now that Roy is in the gym, he can take revenge on the bully by killing him with the knife.

This sequence of actions ensures that Roy confronts the bully and eliminates the threat, allowing him to escape later if needed. Ernest remains in the cell block and is still threatened, but since the goal is to have one of the main characters overcome the bully's threats, Roy's actions are sufficient.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **go(Roy, Hall)**: This action is necessary for Roy to transition from the highway to a location where he can confront the bully.
- **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Locking the gym prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that Roy can confront him without interference.
- **vent(Roy, Gym)**: This action allows Roy to enter the gym undetected, setting up for the confrontation.
- **revenge(Roy, Bully, Gym)**: This is the climax of the story where Roy takes decisive action against the bully, eliminating the threat.
