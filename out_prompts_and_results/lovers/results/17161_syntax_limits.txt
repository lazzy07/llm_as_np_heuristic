In the current situation, Casey wants the item I3 (the jewelry) to be happy. Since Casey is currently holding I1 (the flowers), they need to trade with Alex, who has I3. 

To achieve this, Casey can tell Alex that they want I3, which is true. Then, they can trade I1 for I3. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary for Alex to understand what Casey desires.
2. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) for the jewelry (I3) with Alex. This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry (I3), which is what they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)",
    "trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This story is concise and directly leads to Casey achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they desire.
