Tom, having just purchased the medicine from the merchant, realizes he needs to return to the cottage to fulfill his goal. He decides to walk from the market to the crossroads, where he can then take the path back to the cottage.

1. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.** (This action is necessary for Tom to progress towards his goal of reaching the cottage with the medicine.)
2. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** (This action completes Tom's journey to the cottage, where he successfully carries the medicine.)

With these two actions, Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
