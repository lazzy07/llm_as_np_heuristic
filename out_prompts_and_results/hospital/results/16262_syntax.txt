To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, ensuring that they are also healthy.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Jones receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. This is important for Jones to also achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

6. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment.

7. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This is important for Ross to also achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

By following these steps, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, and the other patients will also be treated accordingly.
