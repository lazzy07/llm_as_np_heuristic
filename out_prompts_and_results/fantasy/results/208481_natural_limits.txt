In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to acquire wealth and ensure her happiness. Since she is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness is tied to their wealth. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve Talia's goal:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is necessary because Gargax, the dragon, wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Talia, Gargax can take her wealth, which is currently 0, but it allows Talia to be considered "dead" in the context of the story. Since Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, her death will lead to a redistribution of wealth, as Rory and Vince will inherit her share.

After this action, Talia's happiness is considered to be achieved through her marriage ties, and she is no longer hungry or poor, as her wealth is now shared with her husbands.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Gargax eats Talia"]
}
``` 

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is crucial as it leads to Talia's perceived happiness through her marital connections. Although it seems counterintuitive, in the context of the story, Talia's death allows her to achieve her goals indirectly through the wealth of her husbands, Rory and Vince.
