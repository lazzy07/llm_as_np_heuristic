To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has just bought from the Merchant. This action is possible because the Bandit is armed with a sword, and Tom is not armed. This action allows the Bandit to gain a coin, which is part of her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her loot in the chest at the camp, which is part of her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has as many coins as possible, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The **rob** action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire a coin from Tom, increasing her wealth without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the guard.
- The **walk** action is necessary for the Bandit to return to her base of operations, where she can safely store her loot.
- The **take** action is the final step to ensure that the Bandit has coins in her possession, thus achieving her goal.
