To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (chocolates). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they want I3, which is currently in the same room (R22) as Alex. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I3) from the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because Alex needs to have the item they want to be happy.

2. **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I3) in the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be used to facilitate a future action if needed. However, since Alex's goal is to be happy, this action can be omitted if we want to keep the story as short as possible.

3. **give(C1, I3, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I3) to themselves, which is a redundant action but can be interpreted as a way to affirm their happiness. 

However, since Alex already has the chocolates after the first action, we can conclude the story after the first action.

Thus, the shortest story where Alex achieves their goal is:

1. Alex picks up the chocolates (I3) from the dining room (R22).

After this action, Alex is happy because they have the item they want.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: This action is essential as it allows Alex to obtain the chocolates they desire, which is the only requirement for Alex to be happy.
