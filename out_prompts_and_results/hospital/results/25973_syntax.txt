To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. Since Ross is in PatientRoomB, and we assume he has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will make Ross healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms so that Hathaway can treat him correctly.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. Assuming Jones has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, making him healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will walk back to Admissions to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms for treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. Assuming Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, making him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
