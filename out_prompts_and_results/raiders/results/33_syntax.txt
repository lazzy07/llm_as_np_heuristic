To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring that the Nazis are dead. Given the current situation, the Nazis have already opened the Ark and died, and the US Army has taken the Ark from the Nazis. Therefore, the story can conclude with the US Army successfully keeping the Ark.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **The Nazis opened the Ark**: This action has already occurred, resulting in their deaths. This is crucial as it eliminates the threat posed by the Nazis, ensuring they cannot pursue their goal of immortality any longer.

2. **The US Army took the Ark from the Nazis**: This action has also already occurred, which means the US Army now possesses the Ark. This is essential as it fulfills Indiana's goal of having the US Army in possession of the Ark.

3. **Indiana Jones remains in Tanis**: Since Indiana is in Tanis and believes the Ark is with the US Army, he can travel to the USA to confirm the Ark's safety and ensure it is in the right hands.

4. **Travel Indiana from Tanis to USA**: This action allows Indiana to join the US Army and verify that the Ark is indeed safe and in their possession.

At this point, the story concludes with the US Army having the Ark and the Nazis being dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
