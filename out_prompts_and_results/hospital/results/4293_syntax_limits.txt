In this story, we will ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. The actions will be carefully chosen to avoid mistakes due to Hathaway's workload and to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will assume that Ross has a rash (symptom of Jarkis) and Hathaway correctly identifies it.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy.

3. **Walk Jones to Exam Room A**: Jones walks from PatientRoomC to PatientRoomA, where Hathaway is currently located. This is necessary for Jones to be assessed and treated.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomA. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2 (after treating Ross), there is no risk of mistake. We will assume that Jones has a fever (symptom of Flaze) and Hathaway correctly identifies it.

5. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Jones healthy.

By following these actions, Jones successfully achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.
