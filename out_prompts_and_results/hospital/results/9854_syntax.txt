To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to PatientRoomB**: Young will walk from Admissions to PatientRoomB to be assessed by Hathaway. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also evaluated and treated if needed, but it is not directly related to Ross's goal.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for Young's health but does not affect Ross's immediate goal.

5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. This ensures that Young is also healthy, which is beneficial for the overall situation in the hospital.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is essential for deciding the correct treatment.
2. **Treat(Ross)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment results, ensuring he receives the correct treatment to become healthy.
3. **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Young walks to PatientRoomB to be assessed by Hathaway, ensuring he is also evaluated.
4. **Assess(Young)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms, which is necessary for Young's health.
5. **Treat(Young)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment results, ensuring he is also healthy.

After these actions, Ross will be healthy, achieving his goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy while also addressing Young's health.
