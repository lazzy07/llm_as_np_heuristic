**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Roy can eliminate the bully's threat and secure his and Ernest's safety. Moving to the hallway and crawling through the vents allows Roy to strategize and confront the bully without being seen. Locking the gym door ensures that the bully cannot escape and that Roy can deal with him directly. Killing the bully removes the immediate danger. Putting on civilian clothes and escaping through the vents allows Roy to leave the prison undetected, achieving his goal of survival and freedom.
