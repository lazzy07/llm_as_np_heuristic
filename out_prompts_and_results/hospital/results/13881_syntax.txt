To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. Similar to Ross, this assessment is crucial for identifying the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, this assessment will help Hathaway understand Jones's condition.

4. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. This is necessary for Young's recovery.

6. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This will ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is crucial to determine the correct disease and treatment for each patient. Without this step, Hathaway cannot make informed treatment decisions.
- **Treating patients**: This is the final step to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment based on their symptoms, leading to their recovery.
