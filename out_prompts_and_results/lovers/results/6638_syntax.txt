To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a room where they can interact with the items.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is important because Casey needs to have an item to trade or give to another character.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially trade items.

4. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up for the flowers (I1) that Alex has. This is the key action that allows Casey to obtain the item they want.

5. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the flowers (I1) in the living room after the trade. This is necessary to finalize the trade and ensure that the flowers are now with Casey.

6. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) in the living room. This action ensures that Casey now has the item they want, achieving their goal of happiness.
