In the living room, Alex, who is already happy with the flowers, sees that Blake is unhappy because he wants the chocolates, and Casey is unhappy because she wants the jewelry. To help Blake achieve his goal, Alex decides to tell Blake that the jewelry is what Casey wants. 

Blake, believing Alex, picks up the jewelry from the living room and gives it to Casey, thinking it will make her happy. Now, Casey is happy with the jewelry, and Blake is still unhappy because he still doesn't have the chocolates. However, Alex's goal of being happy with the flowers is already achieved.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Alex tells Blake that the jewelry is what Casey wants.** - This action is necessary because it misleads Blake into thinking that giving the jewelry to Casey will make her happy, which indirectly helps Alex maintain his happiness with the flowers.
2. **Blake picks up the jewelry from the living room.** - This action is necessary for Blake to have the item he believes will make Casey happy.
3. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.** - This action is necessary for Casey to achieve her happiness, even though it does not directly affect Alex's happiness.
