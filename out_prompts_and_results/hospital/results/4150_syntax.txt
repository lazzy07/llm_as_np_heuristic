To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, assesses and treats the patients correctly to achieve their goal of making all patients healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat more than one patient. Therefore, we will focus on assessing and treating one patient at a time.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is assigned to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to begin the assessment process for one of the patients.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze (assuming Jones has a fever). This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

4. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is assigned to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to continue the treatment process for the next patient.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis (assuming Ross has a rash). This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

7. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Finally, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Young, who is assigned to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to continue the treatment process for the last patient.

8. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

9. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis (assuming Young has a rash). This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway successfully treats all patients without making any mistakes, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
