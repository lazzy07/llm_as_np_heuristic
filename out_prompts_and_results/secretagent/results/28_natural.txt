To complete the story, we need to ensure that the secret agent achieves their goal of killing the mastermind. The actions taken by the secret agent will be focused on confirming the mastermind's death and securing the papers. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. (The secret agent needs to leave the office to ensure the mastermind is dead and to secure the papers.)
2. The secret agent moves from the lobby to the cache. (The secret agent needs to check the cache for any additional information or items that might be useful.)
3. The secret agent finds the papers in the cache. (The secret agent needs to confirm possession of the papers.)
4. The secret agent moves from the cache to the office. (The secret agent returns to the office to ensure everything is secure and to finalize their mission.)
5. The secret agent confirms that the mastermind is not alive. (This is a mental confirmation of the secret agent's success.)
