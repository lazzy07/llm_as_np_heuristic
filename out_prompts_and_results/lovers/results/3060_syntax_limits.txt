In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (flowers), and Blake has item I3 (jewelry). Since Alex is currently unhappy and wants flowers, Blake can give Alex the jewelry, which will make Alex happy. 

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R12). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for happiness by providing them with an item that they want (flowers). Although it does not fulfill Blake's own desire for happiness, it aligns with Blake's goal of making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they received the jewelry, which they wanted.
- Blake will not be happy because they still do not have the item they want (flowers).
- Casey remains unhappy as well.

However, since Blake's primary goal was to make Alex happy, this action successfully achieves that.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

{
  "plan": ["give(C2, I3, C1, R12)"]
}
