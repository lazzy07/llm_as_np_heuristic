**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room B, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds with the assessment. 

1. **Action: Assess Jones in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms, which will inform the treatment. 

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to her high workload. 

2. **Action: Treat Jones in Patient Room B with steroids.**
   - Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones is actually healthy (as indicated by the Unknown symptom), he does not suffer any adverse effects from the treatment.

Now, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is still waiting there.

3. **Action: Walk from Patient Room B to Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to check on Young, who is still unassessed.

Upon reaching Admissions, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.

4. **Action: Assess Young in Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway finds that Young is experiencing symptoms of Flaze (fever). 

5. **Action: Treat Young in Admissions with antibiotics.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Young receives the correct treatment for Flaze, allowing him to become healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 1, and she can focus on Ross next.

6. **Action: Walk from Admissions to Patient Room A.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Ross.

Once at Patient Room A, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.

7. **Action: Assess Ross in Patient Room A.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

Dr. Hathaway finds that Ross is also experiencing symptoms of Flaze.

8. **Action: Treat Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment for Flaze, allowing him to become healthy.

At this point, all patients are healthy, and Jones has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.
