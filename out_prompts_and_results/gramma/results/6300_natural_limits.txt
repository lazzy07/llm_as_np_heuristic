The bandit, now armed with two swords, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She approaches the merchant, who is unaware of the danger she poses. The bandit uses her merchant's sword to threaten the merchant and demands the medicine. The merchant, fearing for her life, hands over the medicine without resistance. 

With the medicine in hand, the bandit feels accomplished. She has successfully obtained the item she wanted without drawing the attention of the guard, who is still preoccupied with the market's activities.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit threatens the merchant with her sword**: This action is necessary for the bandit to obtain the medicine without having to engage in a fight, as the merchant is not armed and cannot defend herself.
2. **The merchant hands over the medicine**: This action fulfills the bandit's goal of acquiring the medicine, which she desires to have in her possession.

The story is kept short and direct, focusing solely on the actions that lead to the bandit's success.
