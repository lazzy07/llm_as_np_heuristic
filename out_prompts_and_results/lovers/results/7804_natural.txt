To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake currently has the jewelry, and it is essential for Casey to get it.

2. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to receive the jewelry, which is what they want to be happy.

3. **Casey is now happy.**  
   - With the jewelry in their possession, Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

The actions are designed to ensure that Casey gets the item they want (the jewelry) while keeping the story concise and focused on achieving the desired outcome.
