To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted Vince's proposal, which can lead to her happiness if they marry. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action will make both of them happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.
2. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia can take the money from Vince, as he has it. This will increase her wealth, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action is necessary because Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal. By marrying him, she will achieve happiness, which is one of her primary goals.
  
- **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: After marrying Vince, Talia can take the money he has. This action is crucial for her to achieve her goal of wealth, as she currently has the treasure but needs the money to be fully wealthy.

With these two actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the money).

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
