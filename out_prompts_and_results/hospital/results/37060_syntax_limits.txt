To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Young has in order to treat them correctly.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment as well.
