To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially trade or give items.

2. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This action is important because it clarifies Alex's desire and sets the stage for Casey to understand what Alex needs.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the crucial action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and allows Casey to return to their previous location.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and potentially receive the item they want.
- **tell(C1, C3, I1, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to understand what Alex wants, which is essential for the next step.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the key action that directly leads to Alex's happiness by providing them with the item they desire.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: While this action does not affect Alex's happiness, it helps to conclude the interaction and return Casey to their previous location.
