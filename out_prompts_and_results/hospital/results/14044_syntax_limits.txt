**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to understand Ross's condition to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: Assuming Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the workload), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. However, this action is necessary to attempt to save Ross.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones and Young, who are currently unassigned and have unknown symptoms. This action is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment. Even with the risk of error, it is critical to act on the patients present.
  
- **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: This action is taken to attempt to cure Ross based on the assumption of his condition. It is a direct effort to fulfill Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

- **Walk to Admissions**: This action allows Hathaway to check on the other patients, Jones and Young, ensuring that they are also assessed and treated, which is essential for achieving the overall goal of patient health.
