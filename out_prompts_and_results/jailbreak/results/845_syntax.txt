**Story Completion:**

1. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**  
   - Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This action is crucial as it allows him to disguise himself and prepares him for an escape.

2. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)**  
   - With the disguise on, Roy makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison. This is the ultimate goal for Roy, as he wants to be alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising Roy is necessary because without the civilian clothes, he would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would not be able to escape. The second action of escaping is the culmination of his efforts to achieve freedom and safety, which aligns with his goal of wanting to be alive and not threatened.
