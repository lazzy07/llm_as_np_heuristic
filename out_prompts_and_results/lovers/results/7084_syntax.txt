To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey (C2) moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This is necessary for Casey to be able to pick up the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C2, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to illustrate Casey's movement in the story.

4. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R12). This action is also not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but continues the flow of the story.

5. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R11). This action is again not strictly necessary but helps to show Casey's journey.

At this point, Casey has the jewelry (I3) and is happy. The other characters, Alex (C1) and Blake (C3), are not directly involved in this sequence of actions since the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.
- **pick_up(C2, I3, R21)**: This is the crucial action that allows Casey to obtain the item they want, leading to their happiness.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**, **move(C2, R22, R12)**, **move(C2, R12, R11)**: These movements are not necessary for achieving happiness but help to create a narrative flow.
