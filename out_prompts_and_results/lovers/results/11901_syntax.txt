To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake (C3) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C2) for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to eventually get the jewelry they want.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C2) will give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry.

3. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Casey (C2) will put down the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the room organized and allows for future interactions.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, making them happy. 

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the jewelry with Casey for the chocolates. This is necessary for Alex to eventually get the jewelry.
2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
3. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Casey puts down the chocolates, which is a minor action that helps maintain the environment.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
