To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest where Bambi is dead, and he is hungry and greedy. The bank clerk is at the bank with one unit of money. Bubba's goal is to get the money from the clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.
   - **Reason**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the clerk while he has the rifle loaded.
   - **Reason**: Since Bubba is greedy and wants the money, stealing it from the clerk is the most direct way to achieve his goal.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
