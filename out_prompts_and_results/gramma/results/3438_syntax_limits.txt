In this story, the Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Given the current situation, the Bandit has already robbed Tom of a coin, which is a step towards her goal. The Bandit can now take the coin she has and walk back to the bandit camp to secure it in her chest.
