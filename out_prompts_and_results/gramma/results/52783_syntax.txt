To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can take the coin that Tom is carrying. This action directly helps the Bandit achieve her goal of acquiring more coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, seeing Tom at the Crossroads, decides to rob him. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit successfully takes the coin from him.
- With the coin now in her possession, the Bandit walks back to the Camp, where she can store the coin in the chest, thus achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for the Bandit to achieve her goal.
