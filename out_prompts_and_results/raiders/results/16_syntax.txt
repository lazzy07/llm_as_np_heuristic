To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the story will focus on their actions after they have opened the Ark of the Covenant. Since the Ark is not dangerous, they have already gained immortality. The US Army and Indiana Jones are both in the USA, unaware of the Nazis' newfound power. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Nazis travel from USA to Tanis**: The Nazis, now immortal, decide to return to Tanis to secure their hold on the Ark and ensure no one else can claim it.
2. **Nazis dig up the Ark in Tanis**: They dig up the Ark to ensure it is safe and secure in their possession, reinforcing their power.
