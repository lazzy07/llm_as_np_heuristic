In this story, Vince's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, he needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since he already has the money, he can focus on obtaining the treasure.

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** - This action is necessary for Vince to leave the cave where the treasure is located and head to the village where he can interact with the other characters and potentially find a way to acquire the treasure.

2. **Vince takes the treasure from Gargax's dead body.** - This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which will make him wealthy. Since Gargax is a dragon and has no interest in happiness, he can be seen as a threat to the humans. By taking the treasure from Gargax's dead body, Vince ensures that he achieves his goal of wealth.

With these two actions, Vince successfully becomes wealthy, fulfilling his goal.
