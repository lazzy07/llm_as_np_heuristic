Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently located. Once inside the gym, he finds the bully distracted and seizes the opportunity to grab the knife that is hidden in the kitchen. With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation, kills him to ensure both his and Roy's safety.
