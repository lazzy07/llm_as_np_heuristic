To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is already in the Forest, and he needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba is at the Bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the Clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the Forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to leave the Bank with the stolen money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi in the Forest. This action fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the location where the money is stored.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the Clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to escape with the stolen money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second condition of the story.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead, achieving the desired outcome of the story.
