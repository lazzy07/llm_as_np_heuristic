1. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess the other patients, Ross and Young, who are currently waiting there. This action is necessary to ensure that Hathaway can evaluate their symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Ross to exam room C. This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to treat Ross based on his symptoms, which are currently unknown to Hathaway but are believed to be the same as Jones's (SymptomA).

3. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room C. This action is important because it confirms that Ross has the same symptoms as Jones, allowing Hathaway to proceed with the correct treatment.

5. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Young to exam room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Young can also be treated for his symptoms.

6. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room B. This action is important to confirm that Young has SymptomB, which is associated with Jarkis.

7. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action ensures that Young also becomes healthy.
