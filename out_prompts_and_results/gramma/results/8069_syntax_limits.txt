In this story, the Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit has already robbed Tom of the medicine and the coin he was carrying. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where the Guard is also present. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Market to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins she has looted from Tom and the Merchant in the chest. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to secure her stolen coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The story is complete with this single action, as it directly leads to the Bandit achieving her goal.
