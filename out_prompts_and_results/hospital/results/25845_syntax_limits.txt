**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze, or with steroids if he shows symptoms of Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's health, ensuring he becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Jones**: This action is essential for Hathaway to understand Jones's condition. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is still necessary to avoid treating Jones incorrectly.
  
- **Treat Jones**: This action is the culmination of Hathaway's efforts to ensure that Jones receives the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. If Hathaway correctly identifies the disease, Jones will become healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
