To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest where he has just shot Bambi, and he is feeling greedy and hungry. He has also just gone to the bank and returned to the forest, which suggests he may have been contemplating robbing the bank but has not yet done so.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank to get the money. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the bank to take the money from the clerk.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to be in a safe place after committing the theft.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, which is a natural consequence of his hunger. This action is included to show that Bubba is fulfilling his needs after the events.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, who is already dead. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is confirmed dead and to satisfy Bubba's hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to steal money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his greed by taking the clerk's money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest to escape after the theft.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger, which is a natural response.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This confirms Bambi's death and satisfies Bubba's hunger.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead.
