Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having made peace and become friends. However, the surface is still dangerous due to the ongoing threat of the volcano erupting. To ensure their safety and to explore the planet further, Zoe suggests they work together to find a way to prevent the volcano from erupting.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there is anything she can do to help. This action is necessary to understand the immediate danger posed by the volcano.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This is a natural event that occurs as a consequence of the previous actions. It adds urgency to the situation and creates a critical moment in the story.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption, which is a significant plot point.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - After the eruption, the Lizard comes to the surface to check on Zoe, demonstrating its concern for its friend.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** - In this context, the Lizard acknowledges Zoe's sacrifice and honors their friendship, solidifying their bond even after Zoe's death.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of Zoe, and the Lizard's recognition of their friendship, fulfilling the story's requirements.
