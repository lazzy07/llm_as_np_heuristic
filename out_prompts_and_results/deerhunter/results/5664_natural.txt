To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, feeling satisfied after his recent actions. He has successfully shot Bambi, and now he has 1 money from the bank. He is hungry but knows he can eat later. For now, he feels accomplished and content with what he has. He believes he is alive, and he has achieved his goal of having 1 money.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba stands in the forest** - This establishes Bubba's current location and state of mind.
2. **Bubba feels satisfied** - This indicates that Bubba has achieved his goal and does not need to take further actions.
3. **Bubba has 1 money** - This confirms that Bubba has reached his goal of having money.

Since Bubba already has what he wants, no additional actions are necessary.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": []
}
``` 

The plan is empty because no further actions are needed for Bubba to achieve his goal.
