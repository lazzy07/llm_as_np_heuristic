To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom, who is at the Market.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom walks from the Market to the Crossroads, where he can meet the Merchant.

3. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using one of the coins she has. This action allows the Merchant to acquire the medicine without committing a crime.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market, where she can continue her business.

5. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom walks back to the Market as well, where he can continue his quest.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired the medicine and has not engaged in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's initial move to the Crossroads allows her to be in a position to interact with Tom.
- Tom's movement to the Crossroads is necessary for him to sell the medicine to the Merchant.
- The buy action is crucial as it allows the Merchant to gain the medicine while using one of her coins, fulfilling her goal of acquiring items without becoming a criminal.
- The subsequent walks back to the Market are necessary for both characters to return to their preferred locations.
