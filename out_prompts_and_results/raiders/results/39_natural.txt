To complete the story, we need to ensure that the U.S. Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant and that the Nazis remain dead. Given the current situation, the U.S. Army already has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead, so no further actions are needed to achieve the desired ending. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Indiana Jones is in the USA.** (This is the starting point of the story.)
2. **The Nazis are at Tanis.** (They are dead, so they cannot take any further actions.)
3. **The U.S. Army is in the USA.** (They currently possess the Ark.)
4. **The U.S. Army has the Ark.** (This is the desired outcome.)
5. **The Ark is dangerous.** (This is a critical detail that ensures the Ark cannot be opened without fatal consequences.)
6. **Indiana Jones is alive.** (He has successfully completed his mission.)
7. **The Nazis are dead.** (They cannot threaten the Ark or Indiana Jones anymore.)
8. **The U.S. Army is alive.** (They are in a position to protect the Ark.)

Since the U.S. Army already has the Ark and the Nazis are dead, no further actions are necessary. The story concludes with the U.S. Army safely in possession of the Ark, and the Nazis eliminated.
