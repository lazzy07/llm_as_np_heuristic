To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.** - Gargax is hungry and wants to find food. By traveling to the cave, he can potentially find the treasure, which he believes will help him with his wealth.

2. **Gargax eats Rory.** - Since Gargax is at the cave and Rory is also there, Gargax will eat Rory. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy his hunger, but it will also lead to Rory's demise.

3. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** - After Rory is eaten, Talia will travel to the cave to find Rory. She believes he is still alive and wants to be with him.

4. **Talia takes the treasure.** - Upon arriving at the cave, Talia finds the treasure. This action is crucial for her to achieve her goal of being wealthy.

5. **Talia becomes hungry.** - After taking the treasure, Talia will become hungry, which is a natural consequence of her actions.

6. **Gargax eats Talia.** - Gargax, now at the cave with Talia, will eat her as well. This action ensures that Gargax satisfies his hunger and also eliminates Talia.

At the end of these actions, Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry is not achieved because he is dead. However, the story is structured to show the consequences of Gargax's actions and the tragic outcomes for both Rory and Talia.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax travels from the village to the cave.",
    "Gargax eats Rory.",
    "Talia travels from the village to the cave.",
    "Talia takes the treasure.",
    "Talia becomes hungry.",
    "Gargax eats Talia."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan outlines the necessary actions taken to reach the conclusion of the story, where Rory's goal is ultimately not achieved due to the fatal actions of Gargax.
