The bandit, having just attacked the merchant and taken the medicine, now seeks to maximize her coins. Since the guard is at the market and unaware of her actions, she decides to return to the bandit camp to secure her coins in the chest.

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her camp where she can store her coins safely.

2. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is not explicitly stated in the original setup but is implied as a logical step for the bandit to secure her loot. However, since the goal is to have coins in the chest, we can assume she is prioritizing her coins.

3. **The bandit takes the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

4. **The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to the crossroads, where she can be in a position to interact with other characters or further her goals.

5. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to potentially interact with the guard or other characters, but her primary goal of having coins is already achieved.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully secured her coins and achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
