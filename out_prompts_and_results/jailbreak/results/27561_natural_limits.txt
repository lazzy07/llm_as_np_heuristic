**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison continued, Roy, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decided to take a risk. He knew that the bully was in the gym and that he had the cigarettes, which were the source of the bully's power over them. With a quick glance around the kitchen to ensure no guards were watching, Roy stealthily pocketed the knife that was left on the counter.

With the knife in hand, Roy made his way to the gym, where he found the bully lifting weights, oblivious to the danger that was about to unfold. Roy approached the bully, who turned to face him with a sneer, ready to assert his dominance. But Roy was quicker; he lunged forward and, in a swift motion, plunged the knife into the bully, ending the threat once and for all.

With the bully dead, Roy felt a surge of relief. He quickly returned to the kitchen, where he found Ernest still working. "It's over," Roy said, showing Ernest the knife and the now-empty gym. They both knew that the bully would no longer threaten them. 

Now, with the bully out of the way, they could plan their escape. They would need to find the civilian clothes and make their way to the highway, but for now, they could breathe a little easier knowing they were no longer under the bully's shadow.
