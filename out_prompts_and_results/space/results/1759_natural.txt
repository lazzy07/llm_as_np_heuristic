Zoe and the Lizard are at the surface of the planet, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. Since they are friends, they can work together to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends now, and the urgency of the situation allows for understanding.

2. **Zoe uses the spaceship's communication system to call the Lizard.** - This action is implied as Zoe would want to ensure the Lizard knows she is safe and to encourage the Lizard to join her on the spaceship.

3. **The Lizard teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for the Lizard to escape the danger of the erupting volcano and join Zoe in safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard celebrate their friendship on the spaceship.** - This action solidifies their bond and ensures both characters feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
