**Story Completion:**

After stealing the knife from the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened by him. To ensure his safety and to achieve his goal of being alive and free from threats, Roy decides to take action. 

Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from coming after him and gives Roy a moment to think. With the bully locked in, Roy can now confront him without the immediate threat of being attacked. 

Next, Roy uses the knife he stole to kill the bully. This action eliminates the threat that the bully posed to both him and Ernest. With the bully dead, Roy can now focus on escaping the prison.

Finally, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can escape from the prison.
