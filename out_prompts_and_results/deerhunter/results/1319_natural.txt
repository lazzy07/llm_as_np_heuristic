To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk, who has the money. Without this action, Bubba cannot interact with the clerk.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will still be confirmed dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
