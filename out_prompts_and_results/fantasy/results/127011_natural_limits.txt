In the cave, Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Vince, who is nearby. This action is crucial because it eliminates one of the humans who has money, allowing Talia to take the money from Vince's dead body. After Gargax eats Vince, Talia can then pick up the money, which will make her wealthy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Gargax eats Vince. (This action is necessary to remove Vince from the story, allowing Talia to access the money.)
2. Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body. (This action makes Talia wealthy, fulfilling her goal.)

After these actions, Talia becomes wealthy, which is one of her primary goals.
