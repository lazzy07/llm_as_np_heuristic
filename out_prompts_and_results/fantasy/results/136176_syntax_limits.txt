In the current situation, Rory is in the Cave with Talia, who has accepted his marriage proposal. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, Rory needs to secure the treasure located in the Cave. Since Talia is already with him, he can propose to marry her, and they can both be happy. However, Rory also needs to ensure he has wealth, which can be achieved by picking up the treasure.

Here’s the shortest story where Rory achieves his goal:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the Cave, which will make him wealthy.

This action is necessary because Rory's goal includes being wealthy, and the treasure is the only item that can fulfill that requirement.

Now, Rory is wealthy, and since he is already happy due to Talia accepting his proposal, he has achieved his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)"]
}
``` 

In this story, Rory successfully picks up the treasure, achieving his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
