To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves from the Crossroads to the Market to confront the remaining characters and potentially loot coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins that the Merchant has. This action is possible because the Merchant is armed but is not carrying a sword, making her vulnerable to robbery.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After acquiring the coins from the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp and place the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully collects coins and secures them in her camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
