To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the flowers.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey and Blake to interact with them.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is what they want.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While this does not affect Alex's happiness, it provides a logical conclusion to the story by returning to the starting point.
