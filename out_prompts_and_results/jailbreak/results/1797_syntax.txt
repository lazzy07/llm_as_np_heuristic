Ernest, after completing his chores in the kitchen, decides to take action to ensure his safety and secure a pack of cigarettes. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife with him. 

1. **Go to Hallway**: Ernest moves from the kitchen to the hallway to get closer to the gym where the bully is located. This action is necessary to position himself for the next steps.
