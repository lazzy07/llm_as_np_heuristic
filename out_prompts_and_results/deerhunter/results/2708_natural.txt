To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to reach the bank to obtain money, as he currently has 0 money and the clerk has 1 money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.
