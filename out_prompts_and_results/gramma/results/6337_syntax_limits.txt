In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Crossroads and has already attacked both Tom and the Merchant. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit has already attacked the Merchant, she can loot the Merchant's sword and the medicine, which she can then use to further her goals.

### Story Completion:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's sword from her corpse. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to become better armed, which can help her in future confrontations and solidifies her status as a criminal.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows the Bandit to arm herself with the Merchant's sword, which is a strategic advantage for her in the future. It also reinforces her criminal status, which aligns with her goals.
- The second action directly fulfills the Bandit's goal of acquiring coins, as she takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.
