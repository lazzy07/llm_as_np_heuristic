To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is important for the same reason as assessing Young; Hathaway needs to know how to treat Ross.

4. **Treat Ross in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomA**: Finally, Hathaway will walk Jones from the admissions room to PatientRoomA. This is necessary because Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assessed and treated.

6. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the last step needed to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

7. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
