Ernest, realizing that Roy is in the gym and threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows he has the knife and the civilian clothes, which could help him escape if he can get to the highway. 

Ernest moves from the hallway to the gym, where he finds both Roy and the bully. The bully, believing Ernest is in the kitchen, is caught off guard.
