In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She currently has the treasure, which is valuable, but she is not wealthy enough to be satisfied. To achieve her goal, Talia needs to acquire the money that Vince has.

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Talia's goal:

1. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.** (This action is necessary for Talia to reach Vince, who has the money.)
2. **Talia takes the money from Vince.** (This action allows Talia to acquire the money she needs to be wealthy.)

After these actions, Talia will have both the treasure and the money, making her wealthy. Since she is already married to Rory and Vince, she will also be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the village**: Talia needs to go to where Vince is located to take the money from him.
- **Taking the money**: This action directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, as she now possesses both the treasure and the money.
