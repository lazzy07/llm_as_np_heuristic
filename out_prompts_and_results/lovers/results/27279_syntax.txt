To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22) to interact with them and potentially acquire the jewelry.
   
2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) that is in the room (R22). This action directly helps Alex achieve their goal of being happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12) after picking up the jewelry. This action is necessary to finalize the acquisition of the item.

4. **put_down(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex puts down the jewelry in the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be seen as a way to keep the item safe or to share it later.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want (jewelry) to pick it up.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is necessary for their happiness.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex returns to the bedroom, which is a logical step after acquiring the item.
- **put_down(C1, I1, R12)**: While this action does not affect Alex's happiness directly, it can be seen as a way to secure the item.
