To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the flowers (I3) they have with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want directly from Casey, who currently has it.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making Alex happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3), which is not what they want, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this trade is acceptable.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to acquire the jewelry they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they want.
