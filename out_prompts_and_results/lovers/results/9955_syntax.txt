To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item currently held by Casey). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I2, R11)**: Alex (C1) can trade the item they want (I3) with Casey (C2) for the item Casey wants (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire while also fulfilling Casey's desire for I2.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have I3, making Alex happy.
- Casey will have I2, making Casey happy.
- Blake remains unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this is acceptable.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I2, R11)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I3) from Casey, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
