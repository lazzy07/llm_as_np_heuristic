To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the bathroom (R21) to get closer to the jewelry, which is in the dining room (R21).
2. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R21) to be with Alex and facilitate the exchange of items.
3. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to help Alex by giving them an item, which may lead to a trade or further actions.
4. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) with the chocolates.
5. **give(C1, I2, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C3) to make Blake happy, which is part of Alex's goal to ensure everyone is happy.
6. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to be with Alex and Casey.
7. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
