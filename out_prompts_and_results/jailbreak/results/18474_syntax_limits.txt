Ernest is currently on the highway, having just crawled through the vents. He has stolen a set of civilian clothes from the laundry room and is now ready to escape. However, he knows that he needs to disguise himself to avoid being caught by the guards. 

To achieve his goal of escaping the prison, Ernest takes the following action:

1. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Highway)**: Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the prison guards as he prepares to escape.

Now that he is disguised, Ernest can safely escape from the prison.

2. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: With the civilian clothes on, Ernest makes his way out of the prison and onto the highway, successfully escaping.

This sequence of actions ensures that Ernest achieves his goal of being alive and free, without being threatened.
