To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure both she and the Lizard are safe and healthy while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and they are both on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is taken to solidify their friendship. Since they are not fighting, this action will help them bond and achieve their goal of making friends.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe wants to be healthy and safe.

Now, let's summarize the story:

Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of a dangerous planet where a volcano is about to erupt. She encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship. With their relationship strengthened, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety from the impending eruption while also leaving the Lizard in a better position to protect the planet.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively achieves Zoe's goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
