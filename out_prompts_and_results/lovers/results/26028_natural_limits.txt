**Story Completion:**

Casey, in the bathroom, picks up the chocolates. 

**Explanation of the Action:**
- Casey wants the jewelry, but since the jewelry is with Alex and Casey believes that Alex is in the living room, Casey cannot directly obtain the jewelry. However, by picking up the chocolates, Casey can potentially trade them later to achieve their goal of happiness. This action is necessary as it allows Casey to have an item that can be used for a trade, which is a step towards achieving their goal.
