To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has just bought from the Merchant. This action is possible because the Bandit is armed and Tom is not. This allows the Bandit to gain a coin, which is part of her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her loot in the chest at the camp.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire a coin without any risk of retaliation since Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her newly acquired coin.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, which is one of her primary goals.
