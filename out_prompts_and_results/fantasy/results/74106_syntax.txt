To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, who has proposed to her and is currently in the cave. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, they can get married, which will make Talia happy. Additionally, Talia needs to acquire wealth, which can be achieved by taking the treasure from the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where Rory is located. This is necessary for Talia to be with Rory to get married.
   
2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village after getting married. This is necessary for her to access the treasure.

4. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village to be with Talia after their marriage.

6. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure.
