To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items later.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

3. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I3) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Casey has. This action is crucial because it allows Casey to have the item they want, which is the chocolates, and it also gives Blake an item they want.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex.

5. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is essential because it allows Alex to receive an item that makes them happy.

6. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room to be with Alex and Casey. This is important for the social dynamic and to ensure everyone is together.

7. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex. This action is also essential because it allows Alex to receive another item that contributes to their happiness.

8. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Finally, Alex picks up the flowers (I1) that are in the living room. This is the final action that ensures Alex achieves their goal of being happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, which is what they wanted, thus achieving their goal.
