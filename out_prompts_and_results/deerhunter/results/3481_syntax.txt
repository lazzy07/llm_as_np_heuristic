To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he should also return to the bank to steal from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money, as the clerk has no money but Bubba can still intimidate him.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba decides to take the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill his greed and achieve his goal of having money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to intimidate the clerk and take money.
4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba fulfills his greed by taking the money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",

  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and achieves his goal of obtaining money.
