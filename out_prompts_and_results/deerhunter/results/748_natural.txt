To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba is at the bank and wants money, he can decide to steal from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can successfully steal the money from the clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes to the forest**: After stealing the money, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to confront Bambi.

4. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi**: Now that Bubba is in the forest with the rifle loaded, he can decide to shoot Bambi. This action fulfills the goal of Bambi being dead.

5. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi**: This final action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The actions are structured to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having money while also fulfilling the condition of Bambi being dead.
