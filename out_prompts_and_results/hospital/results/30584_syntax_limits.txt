**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room C. She knows that Ross is in Patient Room A and Young is in Patient Room B. Since she has admitted both patients, she needs to assess them to determine their symptoms.

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Hathaway assesses Ross to see what symptoms he is showing. This action is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide her treatment decision.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
