Zoe, having just made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows that she must act quickly to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. 

1. **Erupt the Surface**: Zoe decides to let the volcano erupt, knowing that it will create a dangerous situation but also believing that it might force the Lizard to seek safety and potentially lead to a stronger bond between them. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of the story where the volcano erupts.

2. **Make Peace**: As the eruption begins, Zoe and the Lizard, now both aware of the imminent danger, decide to work together to escape the chaos. They realize that they need each other to survive and thus solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it leads to the desired outcome of them becoming friends.

In this short story, the actions taken lead to the volcano erupting, which creates a life-threatening situation, but also brings Zoe and the Lizard closer together as they unite against the danger.
