Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve a resolution, Zoe needs to establish a friendship with the Lizard while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to transition from being enemies to friends. Since they are both in the cave and not fighting, this is a viable action that aligns with their goals of making friends.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have made peace. The eruption signifies the danger of the surface and serves as a dramatic climax to the story. 

3. **Zoe and the Lizard both walk to the surface.** This action is necessary for them to witness the eruption together, reinforcing their newfound friendship as they face the danger of the volcano.

4. **The volcano finishes erupting.** This final event results in the death of both characters, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying while also highlighting the consequences of their actions and the dangers of the planet.

The sequence of actions leads to a resolution where Zoe and the Lizard become friends, but ultimately, they both perish in the eruption, emphasizing the theme of friendship amidst danger.
