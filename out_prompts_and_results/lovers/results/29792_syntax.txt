To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are located. This is important for Alex to share their happiness with others.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it not only fulfills Alex's desire to have the flowers but also makes Casey happy, which aligns with Alex's goal of ensuring Casey's happiness.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their own happiness.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This is essential for Casey to have the item they want.

7. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action ensures that Blake is happy as well.

8. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to be with Casey and Alex. This is important for Blake to be part of the happy moment.

9. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I3) from the dining room. This action allows Blake to achieve their own happiness.
