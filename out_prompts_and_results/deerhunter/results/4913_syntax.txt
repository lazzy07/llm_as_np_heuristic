To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. After eating, he can go back to the bank to steal money from the bank clerk, who is still alive and has money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using the rifle he has loaded. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and his goal to obtain money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where the clerk is located.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money by stealing it from the clerk.
