To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who is at the village, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and by eliminating him, Gargax will take the money, which is essential for Rory's wealth.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax will take the money from Vince's body. This action is necessary for Gargax to acquire wealth, but it also indirectly helps Rory because it allows Gargax to focus on his own goals without interfering with Rory's happiness.

3. **Rory travels to the cave**: Rory will travel from the village to the cave. This action is necessary for Rory to be with Talia, who is at the cave, and to potentially access the treasure.

4. **Talia picks up the treasure**: Talia, who is at the cave, will pick up the treasure. This action is necessary because it allows Talia to gain wealth, which can contribute to Rory's happiness indirectly.

5. **Rory proposes to Talia**: Rory will propose to Talia. This action is necessary for Rory to express his commitment to Talia, which is a step towards achieving happiness.

6. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: Talia will accept Rory's proposal. This action is necessary for both characters to be happy together.

7. **Rory and Talia get married**: Rory and Talia will get married. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures Rory's happiness.

8. **Gargax travels to the cave**: Gargax will travel from the village to the cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to confront Talia and Rory, but it will not affect their happiness since Gargax is focused on wealth.

9. **Gargax gives the money to Rory**: Gargax will give the money to Rory. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

10. **Rory's happiness increases**: With the marriage and the money from Gargax, Rory's happiness increases, fulfilling his goal.

The final sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
