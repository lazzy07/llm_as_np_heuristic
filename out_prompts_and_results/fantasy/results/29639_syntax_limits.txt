To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage or wealth through acquiring money or treasure. Given the current situation, Talia has a marriage proposal from both Rory and Vince, but she has not yet accepted either. 

The most straightforward way to ensure Talia becomes happy is for her to accept Vince's proposal, as this will make both of them happy. Since Vince already has money, this will also contribute to Talia's wealth indirectly, as she will be associated with someone who is wealthy.
