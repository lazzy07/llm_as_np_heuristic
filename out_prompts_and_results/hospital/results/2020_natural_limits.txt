Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on him without any distractions. After assessing Jones, Hathaway discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. 

Next, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy. 

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload decreases to 1, allowing him to manage his responsibilities effectively. 

Now, Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B, as Ross is still in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room. 

Finally, Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. However, since Hathaway's workload is now manageable, he can accurately assess Young and determine the correct treatment for any potential disease.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones and prepares to treat Young, ensuring that all patients have the opportunity to become healthy.
