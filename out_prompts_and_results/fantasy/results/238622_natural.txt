To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to bring the money back to the village where Talia and Rory are located. Rory needs to be wealthy, and Vince currently has the money.

2. **Vince gives the money to Rory.**  
   - This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he needs the money to fulfill his goal. 

3. **Rory picks up the treasure from the cave.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Rory's goal of wealth, but it adds to his overall wealth and can contribute to his happiness.

4. **Rory proposes to Talia.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to achieve happiness, as he needs to be married to Talia to feel fulfilled.

5. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory's happiness, as it confirms their relationship.

6. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness.

After these actions, Rory will be wealthy (having received the money from Vince) and happy (having married Talia).
