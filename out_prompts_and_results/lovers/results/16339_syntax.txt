To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of being happy, which means they need to have the item they want (I1). Since Alex already has I1, we need to focus on making sure that Casey is also happy, which means Casey needs to have I3. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the item they want (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as I2 to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates from the dining room.
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is necessary for their happiness.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex to potentially trade or give items.

4. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake for the flowers (I3).
   - This action is crucial because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (I3), making them happy.

5. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I3) to Casey.
   - This action ensures that Casey has the item they want, which is necessary for their happiness.

After these actions, we have the following situation:
- Alex is happy because they have I1.
- Casey is happy because they have I3.
- Blake is happy because they have I2.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the dining room to pick up I2.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates, which is their desired item.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room to interact with Alex and Blake.
4. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)**: Casey trades I2 for I3 with Blake, fulfilling their desire.
5. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Blake gives I3 to Casey, ensuring Casey's happiness.
