Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve happiness.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
