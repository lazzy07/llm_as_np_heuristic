To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on the surface and have made peace, the next step is to ensure they both remain safe from the dangerous environment. The volcano is a threat, so Zoe should teleport back to the spaceship to avoid danger, while also ensuring that the Lizard understands her intentions of friendship.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the dangerous surface. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe wants to be healthy and safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to show the Lizard that she is committed to being friends and to continue building their relationship. This action is important for maintaining the friendship and demonstrating her willingness to engage with the Lizard.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again to reinforce their friendship. This action is crucial as it solidifies their bond and ensures that both characters are aligned in their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

4. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave, which is a safer location on the surface. This action is necessary to find a more secure place to continue their interaction and avoid any potential dangers from the volcano.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard in the cave, ensuring that they are both safe and solidifying their friendship in a secure environment. This action is essential for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
