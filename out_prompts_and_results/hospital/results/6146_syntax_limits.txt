**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Exam Room A with Ross assigned to Exam Room B. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure Ross's health, Hathaway needs to assess Ross's symptoms first.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to check on Jones, who is still waiting. This action is not necessary for Ross's immediate health but is part of Hathaway's commitment to ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones also receives the appropriate treatment.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: This is the first step to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms.
- **Treat Ross**: This is the critical action that directly impacts Ross's health, ensuring he becomes healthy.
- **Walk to Admissions**: While this does not directly affect Ross's health, it shows Hathaway's dedication to all patients.
- **Assess Jones**: This ensures that Jones is also taken care of, aligning with Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
