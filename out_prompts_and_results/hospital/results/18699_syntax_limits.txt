**Story Completion:**

After admitting Young to Exam Room A, Hathaway assesses Young's symptoms. Young is showing no visible symptoms, so Hathaway concludes that Young is healthy. 

Next, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to admit Ross to Exam Room B. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also showing no symptoms. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze, but since Ross is healthy, he remains alive.

Finally, Hathaway walks back to Exam Room A to check on Young, confirming that Young is indeed healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Young's health status. Since Young shows no symptoms, Hathaway can confirm that Young is healthy.

2. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway needs to admit Ross to another exam room to ensure he receives the necessary care. This action is essential for managing the workload and ensuring all patients are attended to.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Although Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze, treating him with antibiotics does not harm him since he is healthy. This action is crucial for maintaining the health of all patients in the hospital.
