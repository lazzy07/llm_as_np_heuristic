In the cave, Gargax, the dragon, is feeling hungry and has just eaten Vince, a human. He has taken the money from Vince's body, but he still desires more wealth. Talia and Rory are both alive and present in the cave, but they are unaware of Gargax's intentions.

To achieve his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, Gargax decides to eat Rory, who is also in the cave. This action will not only satisfy Gargax's hunger but will also allow him to take any money or treasure Rory might have.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which satisfies his hunger and allows him to take any items Rory had, although Rory has no money or treasure. This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve his goal of not being hungry.

After this action, Gargax will have eaten both Vince and Rory, leaving Talia alone in the cave. Gargax will now be wealthy (having the money from Vince) and not hungry (having eaten both humans).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action is crucial as it fulfills Gargax's need to not be hungry and allows him to maintain his wealth by having the money he took from Vince.
