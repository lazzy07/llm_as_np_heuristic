In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since Blake currently has the flowers, Alex can take a direct action to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
- Alex tells Blake that Casey wants the flowers. 

**Explanation:**
- By telling Blake that Casey wants the flowers, Alex creates a sense of urgency and misdirection. Blake, believing that Casey wants the flowers, may feel compelled to give them to Casey, thus allowing Alex to achieve their goal of obtaining the flowers.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is still not happy because they still want the jewelry.

This single action allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
