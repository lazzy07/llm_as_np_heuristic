To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to treat the patients directly based on their assigned rooms without assessing them first. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway moves to PatientRoomB to treat Jones.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis (the only disease that exists). This will make Jones healthy.
3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway moves back to PatientRoomA to treat Ross.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Ross healthy.
5. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway moves to PatientRoomC to treat Young.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Young healthy.

By treating each patient with the correct treatment based on their assigned rooms, Hathaway ensures that all patients become healthy.
