Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship, aware that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. She knows that the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of their safety, Zoe decides to teleport from the spaceship to the surface.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.

Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and initiates a conversation, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

With their newfound friendship, Zoe and the Lizard can now collaborate to ensure their safety from the erupting volcano.

The story concludes with Zoe achieving her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe.
