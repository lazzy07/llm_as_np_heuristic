To ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey (C3) will trade the flowers (I1) they have just put down with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3), which makes them happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I1), which is not what they want, but they are still happy because they helped Casey achieve their goal.
- Alex (C1) remains unhappy because they still want the chocolates (I2), but their happiness is not the focus of this story.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R21)**: This action allows Casey to get the jewelry they want by trading the flowers they put down with Blake, who has the jewelry.

Now, here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
