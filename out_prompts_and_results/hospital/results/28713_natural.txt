Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, first assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway confirms that Ross is experiencing a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, but Dr. Hathaway believes it is important to assess him to determine the correct course of action. 

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway finds that Young is also experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, making him healthy too.
