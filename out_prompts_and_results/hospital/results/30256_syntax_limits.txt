**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in PatientRoomB, where Ross is located. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway decides to assess Ross first.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the high workload and treats him with steroids. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment for Ross, who actually has Flaze. As a result, Ross dies.

3. **Walk to Young**: Hathaway, now realizing the mistake, walks to Admissions to see Young, who is waiting there.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C, increasing the workload to 3 again. However, Hathaway is determined to treat Young correctly.

5. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he has no symptoms yet, but he is still alive and healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Hathaway successfully treats Young, achieving the goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
