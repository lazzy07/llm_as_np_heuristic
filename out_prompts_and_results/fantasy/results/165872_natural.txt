To complete the story while ensuring Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we can follow these actions:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Talia, Gargax can satisfy his hunger, and since Talia is now dead, Gargax can take the money from her.
   
2. **Gargax takes the money from Talia's dead body.** - Gargax takes the money that Talia had, which increases his wealth. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave.** - Gargax needs to go to the cave to find the treasure, which will further increase his wealth.

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure from the cave.** - By picking up the treasure, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy.

At this point, Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy cannot be achieved because she is dead. However, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
