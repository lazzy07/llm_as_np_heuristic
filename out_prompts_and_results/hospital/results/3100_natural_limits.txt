Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A with Jones. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a chance of misdiagnosing Jones. However, for the sake of the story, let's assume Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Flaze (fever).

2. **Treat Jones**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy, reducing Hathaway's workload to 2.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess the other patients, Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C, increasing the workload back to 3.

5. **Assess Young**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions. Assuming Young has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats Young with steroids, making Young healthy.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.
