To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is currently in the Cave, can take the Treasure from Rory's dead body. This action allows Gargax to acquire the Treasure, which fulfills his desire to be wealthy.

This single action is sufficient to complete the story, as it directly leads to Gargax achieving his goal of wealth.

### Explanation of the Action:
