Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, assesses Jones in Admissions to determine his symptoms. After assessing, Hathaway realizes that Jones is experiencing a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then admits Ross to Exam Room B and assesses him, discovering he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics for Flaze, making him healthy, and then treats Ross with steroids for Jarkis, making him healthy as well. Finally, Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze, but fortunately, Young also has Flaze and becomes healthy.
