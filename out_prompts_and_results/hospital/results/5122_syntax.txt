To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Jones might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will then assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.
