**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, who is currently in the hallway, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is locked in the gym and is a threat to both him and Ernest. To ensure their safety and to achieve his goal of being alive and free, Roy takes the following actions:

1. **Go to the Gym**: Roy moves from the hallway to the gym. This is necessary because he needs to confront the bully directly to eliminate the threat.
   
2. **Kill the Bully**: Once in the gym, Roy uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to kill the bully. This action is crucial as it removes the immediate danger posed by the bully, allowing both him and Ernest to be safe.

3. **Next Day**: After killing the bully, the day ends, and it transitions to day two. This is necessary to signify the completion of the first day and the consequences of Roy's actions.

4. **Disguise Roy with Civilian Clothes**: Since Roy had previously stolen civilian clothes but they were confiscated, he now needs to disguise himself to escape. However, since the clothes are not available, this action is skipped.

5. **Go to the Highway**: Roy moves to the highway, where he can escape from the prison. This is the final step to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

6. **Escape**: Finally, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he had earlier stolen (if they were available) and escapes from the prison. This is the ultimate goal of the story.
