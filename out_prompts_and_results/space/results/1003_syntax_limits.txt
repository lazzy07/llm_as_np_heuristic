Zoe, the space explorer, is determined to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Knowing that the surface is dangerous due to the volcano, she decides to take a proactive approach to establish a connection with the Lizard.

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet, where she believes the Lizard is. This action is necessary for her to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and makes an effort to communicate and establish a friendship. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them remain safe and healthy.
