To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to obtain the treasure located in the cave while also addressing their hunger. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to alleviate their hunger. Rory is present in the cave, making them a viable target for Gargax to eat. This action will satisfy Gargax's hunger and also remove a potential threat (Rory) who might interfere with Gargax's plans.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can now pick up the treasure that is located in the cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax's hunger is now satisfied after eating Rory, so this action is not necessary anymore. However, it is important to note that Gargax's hunger level is now at 0.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Rory).
