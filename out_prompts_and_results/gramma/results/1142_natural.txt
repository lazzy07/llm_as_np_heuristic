The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to loot the bodies of the hero and the merchant at the crossroads. Since both characters are dead, the bandit can take the items they were carrying without any resistance.

1. The bandit loots the hero's body and takes the hero's coin. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count, which is one of her goals.
2. The bandit then loots the merchant's body and takes the medicine. This action is also necessary as it allows the bandit to carry an additional item, which could be useful for future dealings or trades.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she now has the hero's coin and the medicine from the merchant.
