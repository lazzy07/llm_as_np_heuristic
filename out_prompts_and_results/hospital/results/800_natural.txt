**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for Young to be assessed and treated.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still capable of making an accurate assessment.

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess Jones. Since Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway can still make an accurate assessment.

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. This treatment is correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway can accurately assess him due to a workload of 1. After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. This treatment is correct, and Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
