To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant buys the medicine from herself**: The Merchant is currently at the Crossroads with the medicine. She can buy the medicine from herself for 1 coin. This action allows her to keep the medicine while also ensuring she has a coin in her possession.

2. **Merchant walks to the Market**: After acquiring the medicine, the Merchant will walk to the Market. This is her preferred location, and it allows her to interact with other characters and potentially sell items.

3. **Merchant sells the medicine**: Once at the Market, the Merchant can sell the medicine to Tom, who is also at the Market. This transaction will give her another coin, increasing her total.

4. **Merchant walks back to the Crossroads**: After selling the medicine, the Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads. This keeps her in a position to interact with Tom again if needed.

5. **Merchant buys another item (if available)**: If there are any items available for sale at the Crossroads, the Merchant can use her coins to buy them, further increasing her wealth.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant maximizes her coins while remaining within the bounds of legality.
