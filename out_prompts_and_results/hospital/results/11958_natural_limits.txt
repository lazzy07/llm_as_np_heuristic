Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway needs to determine what is wrong with him. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Young has a designated room for assessment and treatment later, as Hathaway needs to manage all patients effectively.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and observes Rash.** This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms. Since Ross has a rash, Hathaway can correctly diagnose him with Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.** This action is essential as it provides the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to assess and treat Young after Ross has been treated.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Rash.** This action is important because it allows Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms, which are the same as Ross's.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** This action ensures that Young also receives the correct treatment for Jarkis, making him healthy as well.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
