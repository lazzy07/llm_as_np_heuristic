To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to walk from the crossroads to the cottage. Since he is already at the crossroads and has the medicine, this is the only action required to complete his objective.

Hereâ€™s the story:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, successfully reaching his destination while carrying the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
