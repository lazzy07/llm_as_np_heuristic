Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway is determined to help Jones. After assessing, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross and Young to their respective exam rooms. Since both patients are still in the admissions room and have unknown symptoms, Hathaway can assign them to exam rooms for further assessment.

1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Jones**: This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy.
3. **Admit Ross and Young**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to exam rooms for assessment and treatment.

By completing these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones and prepares to help Ross and Young.
