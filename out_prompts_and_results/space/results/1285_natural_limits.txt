Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back down to help her friend. She knows that the surface is dangerous, but her concern for the Lizard outweighs her fear. Upon teleporting to the surface, she finds the Lizard struggling to find safety as the ground begins to shake violently. 

Zoe quickly approaches the Lizard and reassures him that they can work together to find a safe spot. The Lizard, feeling grateful for Zoe's presence and support, agrees to work together. They both run towards the cave, where they can find shelter from the eruption. 

However, as they reach the cave, the volcano erupts violently, and the shockwave knocks Zoe unconscious. The Lizard, witnessing this, rushes to her side, using his own strength to shield her from the falling debris. In that moment, the Lizard realizes how much he values Zoe's friendship and that they are stronger together. 

As the eruption subsides, the Lizard manages to revive Zoe, and they both emerge from the cave, grateful to be alive. They solidify their friendship, knowing they can rely on each other in times of danger.
