To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the cottage. Since he is currently at the crossroads, he needs to walk to the cottage to fulfill his objective.

2. **Tom takes the medicine from the merchant.**  
   - This action is essential because the merchant has the medicine, which Tom wants to carry. Since Tom is now at the cottage, he can take the medicine from the merchant, who is still at the market.

3. **Tom walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is not necessary for the final goal, as Tom is already at the cottage with the medicine. Therefore, this action can be omitted.

The final story is as follows:

1. Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.
2. Tom takes the medicine from the merchant.

Now, Tom is at the cottage with the medicine.
