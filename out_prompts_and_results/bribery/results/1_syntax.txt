To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Steal(Villain, Money, Bank)**: The villain steals the money from the bank. This action is necessary because the villain needs the money to bribe the president later.

2. **Bribe(Villain, President, Money)**: The villain uses the stolen money to bribe the president. This action is crucial as it directly leads to the villain gaining control over the president.

After these actions, the villain successfully controls the president, achieving the desired outcome.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Steal**: The villain must first acquire the money to have leverage over the president. Without the money, the bribe cannot occur.
- **Bribe**: This action is the key to the villain's plan. By giving the money to the president, the villain can manipulate the president's actions and decisions, thus gaining control.
