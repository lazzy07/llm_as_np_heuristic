To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit robs the merchant of the medicine. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to ensure that the merchant does not have any valuable items that could be used against her or that could be sold for coins. The bandit is armed and the merchant is not, making this action possible.
