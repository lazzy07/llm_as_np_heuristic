To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to threaten the clerk and steal the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - After successfully stealing the money, Bubba is still hungry, so he decides to eat. This action is not necessary for achieving the goal but adds to the story's completion.

At this point, Bubba has the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the rifle**: Essential for Bubba to be able to threaten the clerk.
- **Stealing the money**: Directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Deciding to eat**: While not necessary for the goal, it reflects Bubba's state of hunger and completes his character's arc.
