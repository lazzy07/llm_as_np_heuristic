To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I3) that Alex picked up. This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry to be happy, and Alex has it.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: After the trade, Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to be in a different room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way for Casey to celebrate their new possession.

3. **put_down(C3, I1, R21)**: Casey puts down the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R21). This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but shows that Casey is now focused on their new item, the jewelry.

At this point, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry (I3), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is crucial as it directly allows Casey to obtain the item they desire (jewelry).
- The move action is optional but adds a narrative element of Casey feeling accomplished and moving to a new space.
- The put down action is also optional but signifies that Casey is no longer concerned with the flowers, having achieved their goal.
