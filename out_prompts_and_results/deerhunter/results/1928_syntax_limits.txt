To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is hungry and has a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi, the deer. This action fulfills Bubba's need to eat and also results in Bambi being dead.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer, satisfying his hunger.

These two actions ensure that Bubba is no longer hungry and that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending. Bubba has a loaded rifle and is in the forest where Bambi is located.
  
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi. It also reinforces the outcome of Bambi being dead.
