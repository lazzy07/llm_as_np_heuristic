To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway should first admit Ross to an exam room. However, since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Ross without making a mistake.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can admit him to Exam Room C. This will allow Hathaway to treat Ross based on the assessment.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in Exam Room A. This will help determine Young's symptoms.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway can admit Young to Exam Room B.

5. **Treat Jones**: Since Jones has already been assessed and has a known symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway can treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze).

6. **Treat Ross**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room C, Hathaway can treat him based on the assessment results.

7. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway can treat Young based on the assessment results.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
