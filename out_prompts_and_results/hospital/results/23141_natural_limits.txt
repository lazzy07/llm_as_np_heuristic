Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of confusion. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating they have Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C, where Jones is located. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway assesses Jones to identify their condition. After the assessment, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze, which also makes Jones healthy.

With both Young and Jones treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
