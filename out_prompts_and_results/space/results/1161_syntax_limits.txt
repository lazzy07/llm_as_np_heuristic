In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are both on the surface of the planet, and the volcano has begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous for both characters. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also allowing for the possibility of friendship, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe will make peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to stop fighting and become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends with other creatures. This action also sets the stage for the next action, as they will need to be in a non-fighting state to survive the eruption together.

2. **The volcano will erupt.** This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to one of the characters dying. Since both characters are on the surface and the volcano is erupting, they will be caught in the eruption.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, saying, "We need to work together to survive this!" The Lizard, sensing Zoe's sincerity, agrees, and they make peace.
- Just as they finish their conversation, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. Unfortunately, both Zoe and the Lizard are unable to escape in time, and they perish in the eruption.

This sequence of actions achieves the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also allowing for the characters to make peace before the tragic end.
