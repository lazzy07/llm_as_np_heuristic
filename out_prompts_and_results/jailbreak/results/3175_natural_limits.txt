**Story Completion:**

After stealing the cigarettes, Ernest knows he is in danger from the bully. He decides to take action to protect himself and Roy. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to escape the immediate threat of the bully in the gym and to access the vents.)
   
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to sneak up on the bully without being seen, as he knows the bully is in the gym.)

3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Ernest prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him without interference.)

4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action allows Ernest to eliminate the threat to both himself and Roy, ensuring their safety.)

With the bully dead, Ernest can now return to Roy without fear of being threatened. They can plan their next move together, but for now, they are safe.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the hallway allows Ernest to escape the cell block and avoid immediate confrontation with the bully.
- Crawling through the vents is a stealthy way to reach the gym without alerting the bully.
- Locking the gym door secures the area, preventing the bully from escaping and allowing Ernest to confront him directly.
- Killing the bully removes the threat, ensuring both Ernest and Roy can live without fear of being harmed.
