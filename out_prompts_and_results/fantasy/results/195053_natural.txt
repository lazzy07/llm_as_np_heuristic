To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human, and Rory is at the cave where Gargax is located. By eating Rory, Gargax will fulfill their hunger, and Rory will no longer be alive, which will allow Rory to achieve happiness through the acceptance of Talia's proposal and the marriage that has already occurred.

2. **Vince takes the money from Rory's dead body**: After Rory is eaten, Vince can take the money from Rory's body. This action is essential for Vince to become wealthy, which is part of Rory's goal since Rory is married to Talia, who has the treasure.

3. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince can propose to Talia, which is a necessary step for him to achieve happiness, as he is now wealthy and can provide for Talia.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which will make both of them happy.

5. **Talia and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies their happiness and fulfills their goals.

The story is short because it focuses on the necessary actions that lead to Rory's goal being achieved through the consequences of the actions taken by Gargax and Vince.
