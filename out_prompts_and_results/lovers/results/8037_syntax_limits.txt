In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and it is located in the same room (R22) where Alex is currently located. Since Alex is not happy yet, the quickest way to achieve their goal is for Alex to pick up the jewelry.

**Action:**
1. pick_up(C1, I1, R22) - Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room.

After this action, Alex will have the item they want (the jewelry), thus achieving their goal of being happy.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire to be happy by obtaining the item they want, which is the jewelry. Since the jewelry is in the same room as Alex, this action is both efficient and effective.
