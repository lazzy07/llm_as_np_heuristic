To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a desire for money. The bank clerk is alive and has money, which makes him a target for Bubba's greed. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the clerk while he has the rifle loaded. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is included because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will return to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to find a place to eat or to hide after the theft.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action satisfies his hunger and completes his goal of eating.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to reach the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger and decides to eat.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest, where he can eat in peace.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger.
