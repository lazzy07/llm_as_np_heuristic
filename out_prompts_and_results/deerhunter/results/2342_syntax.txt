To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba can then go to the forest, where Bambi is located. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but sets up the next action.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The actions are structured to ensure that Bubba first eliminates the bank clerk to access the money, and then he can either choose to go after Bambi or simply leave with the money. However, to meet the requirement of both conditions, he also shoots Bambi.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to take the money from the bank by eliminating the clerk.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is to transition Bubba to the location where Bambi is, setting up for the next action.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
