To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is greedy and hungry, which influences his actions. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle he has loaded. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires without needing to shoot the clerk, which would be unnecessary and could lead to complications.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to find a safe place to hide after committing the theft.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger after the stressful events.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk at the bank.
2. Bubba goes back to the house to ensure his safety after the theft.
3. Bubba decides to eat to satisfy his hunger.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money while also addressing his hunger.
