To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom (R11) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially trade or give items.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Casey of Alex's desire, which may lead to a trade or a gift.

3. **put_down(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R12). This action is necessary for the next step, as it allows for a potential trade.

4. **pick_up(C1, I2, R12)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R12). This is important as it gives Alex an item to trade or give away.

5. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R11). This is necessary to return to a location where they can interact with Blake.

6. **move(C1, R11, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Blake.

7. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action is crucial as it may lead to Blake giving Alex the flowers (I1) in return.

8. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary for Blake to retrieve the flowers.

9. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R21). This is essential as it allows Blake to have the flowers.

10. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to return to Alex.

11. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex receives the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
