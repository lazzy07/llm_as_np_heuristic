To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is dead, as he has already eaten her.

- **Going to the bank**: This is essential for Bubba to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have 1 money.
