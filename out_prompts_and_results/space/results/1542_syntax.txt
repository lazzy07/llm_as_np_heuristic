Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety and establish a friendship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are not fighting, which would jeopardize their safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave, which is safer than the surface. This action helps them avoid the dangers of the surface and find a more secure location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring they are both in a safe place together. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and keeps them away from the dangers of the surface.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship further. This action is essential as it ensures that both characters feel safe and secure in their relationship.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
