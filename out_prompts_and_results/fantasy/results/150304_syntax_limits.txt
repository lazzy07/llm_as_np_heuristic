In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She is currently married to Rory, which makes her happy, but she does not have any wealth. The treasure is located in the cave where she is currently situated, and she needs to acquire it to achieve her goal of wealth.

Hereâ€™s the action that Talia will take:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy, as the treasure represents wealth.

After this action, Talia will have both happiness (from her marriage to Rory) and wealth (from the treasure), thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which is essential for her to become wealthy. Since she is already happy due to her marriage to Rory, this single action fulfills her goal.
