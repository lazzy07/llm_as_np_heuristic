In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market, having just robbed the Merchant of the Medicine. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit is already at the Market and has the Medicine, the next logical step is to take the coins from the Merchant.

The Bandit can rob the Merchant, who is unarmed, and take the coins. This action will help the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, Coins, Merchant, Market)** - The Bandit robs the Merchant of the coins she has. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

After this action, the Bandit will have the coins and can then choose to walk back to the Bandit Camp to store them in the chest if desired, but since the goal is already achieved with the robbery, we can conclude the story here.

### Explanation of the Action:
