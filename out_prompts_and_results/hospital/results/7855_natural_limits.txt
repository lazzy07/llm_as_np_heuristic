Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room, where Jones, Ross, and Young are located.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can begin to assess and treat him. This also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3, which is critical for the next steps.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to manage both patients effectively. Now, Dr. Hathaway's workload is at 4, which is still manageable for the next assessment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the assumption that he might have either Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Ross indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 3.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. Again, since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the assumption that he might have either Flaze or Jarkis.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. If Young indeed has Jarkis, he will become healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2.

By the end of these actions, both Ross and Young are treated successfully, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
