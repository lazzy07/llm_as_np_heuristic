In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room B with Ross, who has been admitted there. Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosing or treating a patient. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Ross correctly.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Hathaway's workload is high, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but assessing is crucial to avoid treating Ross incorrectly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, or if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway can effectively manage Ross's condition and achieve the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
