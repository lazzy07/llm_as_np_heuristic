To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining the money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to leave the bank after stealing the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk has the only money available.
- **Steal the money:** This action is the means by which Bubba can achieve his goal of having money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.
- **Go from the bank to the house:** This action is included to conclude Bubba's journey after achieving his goal. It signifies that he has left the bank with the money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to steal the money",
    "steal the money from the clerk",
    "go from the bank to the house"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story. Bambi is already confirmed dead, so both conditions of the ending are satisfied.
