To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Admissions**: After treatment, Young will walk to the Admissions room to ensure they are in a safe location and can be monitored if needed.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This is essential to identify the correct disease and treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. This is the key action that will lead to Young's health.

3. **walk(Young, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Young walks to the Admissions room after treatment, ensuring they are in a safe place and can be monitored for any further needs.
