**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A first. She walks into the room and assesses Jones, discovering that he has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. Jones becomes healthy as a result of the treatment.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. She then walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room B. 

Once Ross is assigned to Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway assesses him and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. She treats Ross with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis, and he becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room C. She assesses Young and finds that he has a rash as well, indicating he also has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, and he becomes healthy too.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
