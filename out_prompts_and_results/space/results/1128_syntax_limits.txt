In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a precarious situation on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. The goal is to ensure that the story ends with the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.

1. **Erupt the Volcano**: The volcano on the surface is already in a dangerous state, and Zoe is aware of this. By choosing to erupt the volcano, it creates an immediate threat that will force both characters to confront their situation. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of the volcano erupting.

2. **Make Peace**: After the eruption begins, Zoe and the Lizard realize that they need to work together to survive the impending danger. They decide to make peace, which allows them to become friends despite the chaos around them. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of both characters wanting to make friends.

The final sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, which will ultimately result in Zoe's demise, while also establishing a friendship between her and the Lizard.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which is a critical event that leads to the danger of the surface and fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting.
- **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, which aligns with their goals of wanting to make friends with other creatures, even in the face of danger.

The final outcome is that the volcano erupts, leading to Zoe's death, while the Lizard and Zoe become friends before the eruption.
