Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment increasingly dangerous. She knows that her goal is to be healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take a proactive step to ensure both their safety.

Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, leaving the dangerous surface behind. This action ensures her safety and allows her to plan her next move to help the Lizard.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. By teleporting to the ship, she can avoid potential harm and think of a way to help the Lizard, thus working towards her goal of being healthy and safe.

After teleporting, Zoe can use her ship's resources to assist the Lizard, but for the purpose of this story, the single action of teleporting is sufficient to achieve her immediate goal of safety.
