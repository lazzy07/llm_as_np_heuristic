To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure located in the cave. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Gargax needs to reach the cave to access the treasure. 

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure.**  
   - By picking up the treasure, Gargax increases their wealth, which is one of their primary goals.

3. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - Gargax is still hungry after traveling, and eating Rory will satisfy that hunger while also eliminating a potential threat.

4. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body.**  
   - Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money, further increasing their wealth.

At this point, Gargax has achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring both the treasure and the money) and is no longer hungry (after eating Rory).
