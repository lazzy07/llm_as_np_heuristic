To complete the story, we need to ensure that Tom successfully reaches the cottage while carrying the medicine. Given the current situation, Tom is at the Crossroads with the medicine, and the Merchant is also at the Crossroads. The Guard is at the Market, and the Bandit has been killed by the Guard. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will allow Tom to achieve his goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, carrying the medicine. This action directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

This is the only action needed because Tom is already in possession of the medicine and just needs to reach the Cottage.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it allows Tom to move to his desired location (the Cottage) while carrying the medicine, thus achieving his goal.
