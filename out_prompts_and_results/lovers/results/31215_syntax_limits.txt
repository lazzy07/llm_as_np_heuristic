In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, and they currently have it. However, Alex has given it to Casey (C2), who is not happy because they want item I2 (chocolates), which is in the dining room (R21). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to ensure that Casey is happy as well.

To do this, Alex can take the following action:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates (I2) that Casey wants.

This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item that Casey desires, which will make Casey happy. Once Casey is happy, Alex will also feel fulfilled in their goal of making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be in the dining room with the chocolates.
- Casey will be happy because they will receive the chocolates from Alex.
- Alex will also feel a sense of happiness knowing that they have made Casey happy.
