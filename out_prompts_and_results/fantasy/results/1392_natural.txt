To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. Gargax eats Rory. 
2. Gargax takes the money from Rory's dead body.
3. Gargax picks up the treasure.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. Eating Rory also eliminates a potential threat, as Rory is another character who could interfere with Gargax's plans.
   
2. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's dead body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money that Rory had. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **Gargax picks up the treasure**: The treasure is located in the cave, and since Gargax is already there, this action allows Gargax to further increase their wealth.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring both the money and the treasure) and will no longer be hungry (after eating Rory).
