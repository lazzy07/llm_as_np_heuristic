**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he needs to ensure both he and Roy can escape safely. 

1. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (He needs to confront the bully to secure their safety.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and allows Ernest to confront him without fear of outside interference.)
3. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (He needs a weapon to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
4. **Ernest kills the bully.** (This action ensures that the threat to both him and Roy is eliminated.)
5. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (He is already disguised, so this step is unnecessary, but it reinforces his readiness to escape.)
6. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This allows him to escape the prison without being detected.)
7. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (This is the final goal, ensuring his survival.)
