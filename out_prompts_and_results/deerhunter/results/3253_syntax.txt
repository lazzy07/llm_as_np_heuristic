To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest where Bambi is dead, and he is hungry. He also has a rifle and ammunition, which he can use to threaten the bank clerk for money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and demand money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will threaten the bank clerk with his rifle to steal the money. This action is necessary to achieve the goal of Bubba obtaining the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest. This action is necessary to conclude the story with Bubba having the money in a safe location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to intimidate the clerk and steal the money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest with the stolen money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
