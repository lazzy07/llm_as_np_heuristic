Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that both Jones and Ross are in need of assessment and treatment. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake if they try to assess both patients. Therefore, Hathaway decides to first assess Jones, who is in Patient Room B.

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers that he is experiencing a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to identify the correct disease and avoid a potential mistake due to the high workload.

2. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room A, which allows for a future assessment and treatment. This action is important to ensure that Ross can be treated promptly, although it does not directly affect the immediate goal of making Jones healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving the goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
