To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to reach the cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit, who is currently at the Crossroads, will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to remove the Bandit from the Crossroads, ensuring Tom can safely reach the cottage without encountering the Bandit.

With these two actions, Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it directly moves Tom to the cottage, where he wants to be.
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit is not at the Crossroads when Tom is moving to the cottage, preventing any potential conflict.
