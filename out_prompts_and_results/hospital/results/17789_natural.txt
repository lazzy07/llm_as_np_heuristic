**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Young does not survive the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address the other patients in Admissions.

3. **Walk from Patient Room C to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Jones does not survive the treatment.

6. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Once more, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. Ross does not survive the treatment.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although well-intentioned, lead to the unfortunate demise of all patients due to her mistakes caused by her high workload. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young, Jones, and Ross is necessary to determine their conditions, even though the assessments lead to mistakes due to the high workload.
- Treating Young, Jones, and Ross is necessary to attempt to make them healthy, but the incorrect treatments result in their demise.
- Walking between rooms is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients in Admissions after assessing Young.
