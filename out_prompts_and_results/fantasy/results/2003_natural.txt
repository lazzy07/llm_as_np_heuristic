To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth, and the treasure is located in the cave.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to return to the village to interact with Rory and potentially improve her happiness.

3. **Talia gives the treasure to Rory.**  
   - By giving the treasure to Rory, Talia can ensure that Rory is happy, which in turn can contribute to her own happiness since they are married.

4. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - Rory's happiness increases because he now has the treasure, which fulfills his desire for wealth and contributes to Talia's happiness as well.

5. **Talia becomes happy.**  
   - Talia's happiness increases because she has made Rory happy, fulfilling her goal of being happy.

At the end of these actions, Talia has achieved her goal of being happy and wealthy (through the treasure), while Rory is also happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "Talia travels from the cave to the village.",
    "Talia gives the treasure to Rory.",
    "Rory becomes happy.",
    "Talia becomes happy."
  ]
}
