**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, Roy locks the gym door to trap the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening them further and gives Roy a chance to confront him later.

After locking the gym door, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will allow him to escape the prison without being recognized. 

With the gym door locked and the bully trapped, Roy then crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he takes off the civilian clothes to avoid detection and successfully escapes from the prison.
