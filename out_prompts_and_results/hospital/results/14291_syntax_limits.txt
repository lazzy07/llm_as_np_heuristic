**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room A. Ross, who is feeling unwell, is in the admissions room. Hathaway has already admitted Ross to Exam Room A, but Ross has walked back to the admissions room. 

1. **Action: walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**  
   Ross walks back to Patient Room A where Hathaway is located. This action is necessary for Ross to be assessed and treated by Hathaway.

2. **Action: assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomA)**  
   Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that Ross has Flaze. This action is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Action: treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**  
   Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is essential for Ross to become healthy.

After these actions, Ross is treated successfully and achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.
