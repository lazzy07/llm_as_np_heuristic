In the current situation, the Bandit has already attacked Tom and looted the TomCoin from the Merchant. The Bandit is now in possession of the TomCoin and is at the Market, where the Guard is also present. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. 

To achieve this goal, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Market to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins she has looted. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to secure her coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

This single action is sufficient for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit moves to the Bandit Camp to store the coins she has looted. This is the only action needed to achieve her goal, as it directly leads to her having coins in a secure location.
