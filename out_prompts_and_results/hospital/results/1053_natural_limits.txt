Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room A. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young is experiencing a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young of Flaze.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. Hathaway then walks back to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room B. This is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated as well.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones. Upon assessment, Hathaway finds that Jones is experiencing a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully curing Jones of Jarkis.
