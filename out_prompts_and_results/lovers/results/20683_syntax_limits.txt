In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - flowers). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want jewelry (I3), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want chocolates (I2). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex needs to help Casey get the item they want.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers (I1) they have with Casey for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, making them happy. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will no longer have the flowers but will have the jewelry.
- Casey will have the flowers and will be happy.
- Blake will still be unhappy, but Alex's goal of making Casey happy is achieved.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey becomes happy. Since Alex already has what they want, they can focus on making Casey happy by giving them the item they desire.
