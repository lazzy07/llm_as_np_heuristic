Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, decides to take action. He points the rifle at the bank clerk, who is startled but remains calm. Bubba demands the clerk's money. The clerk, seeing the loaded rifle, hands over the 1 money without resistance. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not included because it is unnecessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. Instead, he uses intimidation.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is implied when Bubba demands the money, and the clerk willingly gives it to him due to the threat of the rifle.
3. **Bubba now has 1 money**: This is the final state that fulfills Bubba's goal.

The story is short and direct, with only the necessary actions to achieve the goal of Bubba obtaining money.
