Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard instead of fighting. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing that they both want to be healthy and safe. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing their shared goals, agrees to become friends. 

As they are making peace, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, quickly teleport to the spaceship to escape the danger, ensuring their safety.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Make Peace**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendship, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to be healthy and safe. It also prevents a fight, which would have made their situation worse.
2. **Teleport to the Spaceship**: This action is necessary to escape the erupting volcano, ensuring both characters survive the immediate danger.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, but both characters are safe due to their newfound friendship and quick action.
