To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway assesses and treats Jones correctly, as Jones is currently the only patient in an exam room. Since Jones has SymptomA, we need to ensure that Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment for Flaze (antibiotics). This will lead to Jones becoming healthy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to confirm that Jones has Flaze (since he has SymptomA).
2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Now, let’s outline the actions and their explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomA, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to confirm Jones's symptoms. Since Jones has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Flaze.
   
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After confirming the diagnosis, Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will result in Jones becoming healthy.

At the end of these actions, Jones will be healthy, achieving the goal of the story.
