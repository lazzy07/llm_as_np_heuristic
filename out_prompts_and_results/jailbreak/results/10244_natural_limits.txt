Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully believes he is in the laundry room, so he uses this to his advantage. 

**Action:** Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym, where the bully is locked in. Once inside, he confronts the bully and uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to kill him. 

This action is crucial because it eliminates the immediate threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to feel safe. With the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on getting the pack of cigarettes without fear of retaliation. 

After killing the bully, Ernest can return to the hallway, put on the civilian clothes from the laundry room, and escape to the highway, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of the action:**
- Crawling through the vents allows Ernest to bypass the locked gym door and confront the bully without being threatened.
- Killing the bully removes the danger he poses to both Ernest and Roy, ensuring their safety.
- After the confrontation, Ernest can then proceed to escape, fulfilling his desire to be alive and free.
