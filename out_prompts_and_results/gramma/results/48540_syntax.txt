To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action directly moves him to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because it allows Tom to reach the Cottage, which is his goal. Since he is already carrying the medicine, once he arrives at the Cottage, he will have successfully achieved his objective.

No other actions are needed because Tom is already carrying the medicine, and there are no threats or complications that require further actions.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
