To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal.** (Bubba wants money and the clerk has it.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba wants to escape after stealing.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi.)
5. **Bubba goes from the forest to the forest.** (This action is redundant but can be interpreted as Bubba searching for Bambi.)
6. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot Bambi to fulfill his hunger.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to steal:** This action is necessary because Bubba wants money, and the clerk has it. 
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest:** After stealing, Bubba needs to escape to avoid confrontation with the clerk.
- **Bubba decides to eat:** Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger.
- **Bubba goes from the forest to the forest:** This action is not strictly necessary but can be seen as Bubba looking for Bambi to eat.
- **Bubba shoots Bambi:** This action fulfills the requirement of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead, as it results in Bambi's death.
