To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy because they do not have the jewelry, and Casey (C3) currently has it. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I3) they picked up with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want directly from Casey.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3), which is not what they want, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry, which fulfills their desire.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to acquire the jewelry they want in exchange for the flowers they have. This directly leads to Alex's happiness.
