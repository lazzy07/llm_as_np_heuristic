To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in her preferred location, where she can interact with customers and conduct business.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard is moving to the crossroads to potentially confront the bandit, which indirectly helps the merchant by keeping the market safer and allowing her to conduct business without fear of banditry.

3. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit is moving towards the crossroads, where she can potentially confront the guard or the merchant. This action is necessary for the bandit to try to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

4. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant.**  
   - The guard's action of reporting the bandit’s location to the merchant helps the merchant by informing her of the threat, allowing her to take precautions or adjust her strategy.

5. **The merchant buys the bandit's sword from the bandit using the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to acquire an item of value (the sword) while also using the coin she has, thus achieving her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

6. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to be in a position to sell her sword or interact with other characters, furthering her goal of acquiring more coins.

7. **The merchant sells the sword to the guard for two coins.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain more coins, fulfilling her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without engaging in criminal activity.

At the end of these actions, the merchant has successfully acquired coins through legal means, achieving her goal.
