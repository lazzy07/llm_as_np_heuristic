2. **Roy moves to the hallway.** This action allows Roy to get closer to Ernest and potentially confront the bully.

5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** This action is the climax of the story, allowing Roy to eliminate the threat to both himself and Ernest.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's survival while eliminating the bully's threat. The knife is essential for the confrontation, and the disguise is crucial for the escape. Locking the gym door prevents the bully from retaliating or escaping, ensuring Roy can safely deal with the situation.
