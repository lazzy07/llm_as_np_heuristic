**Story Completion:**

After Roy finishes his chores in the kitchen, he finds himself in the hallway. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the cigarettes, Roy decides to take a risk. He locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, making it easier for Roy to confront him later.

Next, Roy decides to go back to the laundry room to retrieve the knife. He knows that with the knife, he can confront the bully and potentially kill him, thus overcoming the threat to both himself and Ernest.
