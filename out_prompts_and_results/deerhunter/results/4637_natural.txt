To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest, which is a safe location for him.

At this point, Bubba has successfully stolen the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
