To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess another patient. However, we need to assess Ross first to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, making him healthy.

3. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. 

4. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, making him healthy.
