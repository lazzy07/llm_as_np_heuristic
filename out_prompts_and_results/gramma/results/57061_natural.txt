To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to leave the cottage where the hero is and move towards the crossroads, where she can interact with other characters.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit needs to reach the market to potentially find the merchant and steal coins or items.

3. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the merchant who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, which is essential for her goal of accumulating coins.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to either head back to the camp or further her plans.

5. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - Finally, the bandit returns to her camp, where she can store the coins she has acquired.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins.
