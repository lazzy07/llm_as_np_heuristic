Zoe, realizing that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to take action to ensure both her and the Lizard's safety. She knows that the Lizard is still at the surface and is in danger. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** This action is necessary because Zoe wants to help her friend, the Lizard, who is in danger. By teleporting to the surface, she can warn the Lizard about the imminent eruption and help them both escape.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Since they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they can work together to escape the danger. It also emphasizes their mutual goal of being healthy and safe.

As Zoe arrives on the surface, she sees the Lizard and quickly warns them about the volcano. They both realize they need to work together to find safety. However, as they are making their way to safety, the volcano erupts, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to their demise.

This story ends with the volcano erupting and the Lizard dying, while also highlighting the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
