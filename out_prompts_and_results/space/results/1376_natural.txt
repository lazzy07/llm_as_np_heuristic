Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is dangerous due to the potential for a volcanic eruption. To ensure their safety and health, they decide to find a safe place together. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action is taken to find shelter from the dangers of the surface, as the cave may provide safety from the erupting volcano.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they stay together and can support each other in a safe environment.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave**: Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and commitment to looking out for each other, ensuring they both feel safe and healthy.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave**: They decide to stay in the cave until the danger from the surface has passed, ensuring their safety from the erupting volcano.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
