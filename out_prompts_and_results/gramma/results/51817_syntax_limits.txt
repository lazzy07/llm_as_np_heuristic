To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can acquire the medicine from the merchant and then leave the market without being harmed by the bandit or the guard. Given the current situation, the following actions will help Tom achieve his goal:

1. **Buy the medicine from the merchant**: Tom can use the coin he has to buy the medicine from the merchant. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal.

2. **Walk from the market to the cottage**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom can walk directly to the cottage. This action is essential for him to reach his desired location.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom uses the coin he obtained from the bandit to buy the medicine from the merchant. This action is crucial as it allows Tom to acquire the medicine he needs.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: After obtaining the medicine, Tom walks to the cottage. This action fulfills his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
