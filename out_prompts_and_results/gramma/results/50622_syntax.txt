To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coin that Tom had just bought from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire a coin without needing to go to the bandit camp or market.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coin from the Merchant and head to the bandit camp to place it in the chest. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- The Bandit, having just seen Tom attacked and killed, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the Merchant is nearby and has coins. 
- The Bandit approaches the Merchant at the Crossroads and successfully robs her of the coin that Tom had just purchased. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count.
- After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit walks to the bandit camp and places the coin in the chest. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins secured in her camp, achieving her goal.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
