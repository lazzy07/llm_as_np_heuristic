Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both needs. He is at the bank, where he knows the clerk has money. 

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares him to threaten the bank clerk for the money he desires.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba threatens the bank clerk and steals the money. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After successfully stealing the money, Bubba decides to eat, satisfying his hunger.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goals of obtaining money and addressing his hunger in the shortest possible way.
