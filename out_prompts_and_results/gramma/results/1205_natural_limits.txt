Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the market. He knows that the merchant has his coin, but he is focused on getting back to the cottage with the medicine. 

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is strategic because it not only helps the guard in his duty to eliminate criminals but also creates a distraction that allows Tom to leave the market without drawing attention to himself as a criminal. 

After reporting the bandit, Tom walks from the market to the crossroads and then continues on the path to the cottage, successfully reaching his destination with the medicine.

2. **Walk from the market to the crossroads, then to the cottage**: This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
