**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is alive and in the room, Hathaway can assess him. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is still in admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B and finds that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Young healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Since Ross is still in admissions, Hathaway admits him to Patient Room C. After admitting, Hathaway assesses Ross and finds he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, making him healthy.

At this point, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
