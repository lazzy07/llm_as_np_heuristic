In this story, Rory is currently in the cave with the treasure, while Talia and Vince are in the village. To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, he needs to ensure he has both wealth and happiness. Since Rory already has the treasure, he can propose to Talia, who has accepted Vince's proposal but is not yet married to him. 

Rory will take the action of proposing to Talia, which will make him happy if she accepts. Since Talia is looking for wealth and happiness, she may be inclined to accept Rory's proposal, especially since she has already accepted Vince's proposal but is not yet married to him. 

Hereâ€™s the action that will be taken:

1. **Propose**: Rory proposes to Talia in the cave.

This action is necessary because it allows Rory to pursue happiness through a relationship with Talia, who is also seeking wealth and happiness. If Talia accepts, Rory will achieve his goal of happiness, and since he already has the treasure, he will also be wealthy.

### Final Plan
```json
{
  "plan": ["propose(Rory, Talia, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most effective way for Rory to achieve his goals within the constraints of the story.
