In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that Blake has, while also ensuring that Blake gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I1, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I2) they picked up in the living room with Blake (C2) for the flowers (I1) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (jewelry) while also giving Blake the item they want (flowers). 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Alex remains unhappy, but the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.

Thus, the story is complete with just one action that satisfies Casey's desire for happiness.
