To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to this outcome:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) to be closer to Alex, who is currently in the dining room and has the jewelry (I3).
   
2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Casey actually wants the jewelry (I3). However, this action is intended to create a situation where Alex might feel compelled to help Casey.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) to respond to Casey's presence and the conversation.

4. **give(C1, I3, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.

5. **put_down(C1, I2, R12)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I2) in the bedroom after giving the jewelry to Casey. This action is not necessary for Casey's happiness but shows that Alex is willing to sacrifice their own desire for Casey's happiness.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to come to the bedroom to interact with Casey and give them the item.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R12)**: This is the crucial action where Casey receives the jewelry, fulfilling their goal.
- **put_down(C1, I2, R12)**: While not necessary for Casey's happiness, it shows Alex's willingness to prioritize Casey's happiness over their own desires.
