To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want (I1 - flowers). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the flowers.

2. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This action is important because it communicates Alex's desire to Casey, who may be able to help.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This is the key action that fulfills Alex's desire and makes them happy.

4. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the room where Alex is now happy. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamic.

5. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey also moves to the room where Alex is. This action is similar to Blake's and helps to keep the characters together.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and receive the flowers.
- **tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)**: This action is crucial for informing Casey of Alex's desire for the flowers, which is necessary for Casey to act.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the action that directly fulfills Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers, making them happy.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)** and **move(C3, R22, R12)**: These actions are not necessary for Alex's happiness but help maintain the social aspect of the story, showing that the characters are still connected.
