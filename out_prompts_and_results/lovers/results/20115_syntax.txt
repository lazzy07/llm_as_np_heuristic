To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey (C2) moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21) where Alex (C1) and Blake (C3) are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with the other characters and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Blake (C3) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R21). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake, who has the jewelry. Without this movement, Casey cannot receive the item they want.
- **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: This action is crucial as it directly transfers the jewelry from Blake to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.
