To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Currently, Blake is in the dining room (R22) and does not have any items, while Casey is in the living room (R12) with the jewelry (I2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room to the living room to be closer to Blake. This is necessary because Casey has the jewelry that Blake wants, and they need to be in the same room to trade or give items.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry they want, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary to bring Casey to the same room as Blake, allowing for the transfer of the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: This action is essential as it directly gives Blake the item they want, thus making Blake happy.
