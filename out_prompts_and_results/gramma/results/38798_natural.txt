To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the same location as the bandit, where she can potentially acquire coins.

2. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant ensures that the guard will take action against the bandit, which will help her avoid any criminal implications while still benefiting from the situation.

3. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit, allowing the merchant to loot the bandit's coins without any risk of being labeled a criminal.

4. **The merchant loots the bandit's coins from the corpse.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to acquire the coins that the bandit was carrying, thus achieving her goal of obtaining as many coins as possible.

The sequence of actions ensures that the merchant remains within the bounds of legality while maximizing her coin collection.
