On day one, after finishing his chores in the laundry room, Roy decides to take a risk. He sneaks into the kitchen to grab the knife, knowing that it could be his only chance to protect himself and Ernest from the bully. With the knife in hand, he quickly moves to the hallway, where he can hear the bully still in the gym.

Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. With the knife, he confronts the bully, who is furious at being locked in. In a swift motion, Roy takes revenge and kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
