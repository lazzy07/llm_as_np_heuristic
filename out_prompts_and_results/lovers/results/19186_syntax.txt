To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Casey (C3) gives the item they have (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R11)**: This action is necessary because Casey currently has chocolates (I1) and needs to give them to Alex to help Alex become happy. Since Alex wants the flowers (I1), this will allow Alex to be happy and also help Casey in the long run.

2. **Alex (C1) gives the item they have (I2) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R11)**: After receiving the chocolates from Casey, Alex can now give the flowers (I2) to Casey. This is crucial because Casey wants the jewelry (I3), and by receiving the flowers, Casey can then trade them for the jewelry.

3. **Casey (C3) moves to the dining room (R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as the jewelry, which is located in the dining room.

4. **Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) with Blake (C2) in the dining room (R21)**: This final action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they want.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R11)**: Casey gives chocolates to Alex.
2. **give(C1, I2, C3, R11)**: Alex gives flowers to Casey.
3. **move(C3, R11, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room.
4. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey trades flowers for jewelry with Blake.
