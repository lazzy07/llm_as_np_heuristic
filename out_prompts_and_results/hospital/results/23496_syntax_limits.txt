**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to both exam room A and exam room B, Hathaway walks to exam room B to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room B to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is in the admissions room, he has not yet been assigned to an exam room, so Hathaway cannot assess him yet. Instead, Hathaway should assess Jones in exam room A, where he is currently located.

2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in exam room A. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

3. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

4. **Admit Young**: Hathaway then admits Young to exam room C, where he can be assessed later.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with his goal of having all hospital patients be healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
- **Treat Jones**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Jones's recovery from Flaze.
- **Admit Young**: This action prepares for Young's assessment and treatment, ensuring that Hathaway can continue to work towards the health of all patients.
