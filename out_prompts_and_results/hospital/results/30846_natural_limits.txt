Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway is determined to help Ross. After assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to an exam room. Since Jones is the only patient left in Admissions, Hathaway assigns him to Patient Room B. 

This sequence of actions ensures that both Ross and Jones are treated, and since Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, the story concludes with both patients alive and healthy.
