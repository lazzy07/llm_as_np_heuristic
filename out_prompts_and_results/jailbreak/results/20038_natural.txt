**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy finishes his chores in the kitchen and realizes that he needs to help Ernest, who is locked in the gym with the bully. Knowing that the bully is a threat, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy sneaks into the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where Ernest is being threatened.)
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to bypass the locked door and reach Ernest without alerting the bully.)
3. **Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for Roy to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
4. **Roy unlocks the gym door.** (This action allows him to enter the gym and confront the bully.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the final action that ensures both he and Ernest are no longer threatened, allowing them to survive.)

With the bully dead, Roy and Ernest are safe from further threats. They can now plan their escape together.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Sneaking into the hallway is crucial for Roy to get closer to Ernest without being seen by the bully.
- Crawling through the vents is a stealthy way to enter the gym, avoiding confrontation with the bully until Roy is ready.
- Retrieving the knife is necessary for self-defense and to eliminate the bully, who poses a direct threat to both of them.
- Unlocking the gym door allows Roy to enter and take action against the bully.
- Killing the bully is the ultimate goal to ensure both characters can live without fear of being threatened.
