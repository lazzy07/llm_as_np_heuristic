To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, who is now dead. Bubba is also hungry, which means he might want to eat Bambi. However, his primary goal is to get money, and the bank clerk has money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and possibly feel more motivated to pursue his goal of getting money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where the money is.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is important for his well-being and motivation.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where the money is located.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
