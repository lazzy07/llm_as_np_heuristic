To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable after losing the medicine.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action is necessary to ensure that she has the coins she desires in her possession.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit robs Tom to acquire his coin, which is essential for her goal of accumulating wealth.
- She then walks to the bandit camp to secure her coins, as being at the camp is her preferred location.
- Finally, she takes the coins from the chest, ensuring she has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
