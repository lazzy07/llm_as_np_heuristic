After the events that have transpired, Tom is at the Crossroads with the Merchant's sword and the medicine he purchased. The Bandit is also at the Crossroads, and Tom knows that the Bandit is a criminal who likely has coins. 

To achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, Tom can take the following action:

1. **Walk from Crossroads to Cottage**: This action allows Tom to leave the Crossroads and head directly to the cottage, where he can safely carry the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. There are no other actions required since Tom already possesses the medicine and is not in immediate danger from the Bandit.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

In summary, Tom successfully reaches his goal with a single action, ensuring he is at the cottage with the medicine.
