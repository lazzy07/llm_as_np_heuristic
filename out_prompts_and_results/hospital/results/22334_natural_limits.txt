Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C, as Young is the only patient left in Admissions. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and observes the rash, confirming that Young has Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway is determined to treat Young correctly. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. This successfully makes Young healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
