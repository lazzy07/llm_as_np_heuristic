To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R12). This action is also not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room (R22) to check on Casey. This action is included to show Blake's concern for Casey's happiness.

6. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to see if Casey is okay. This action is included to show Alex's concern for both Casey and Blake.
