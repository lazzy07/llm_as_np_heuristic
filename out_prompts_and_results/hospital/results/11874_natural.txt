**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives attention and is not left in Admissions, where he could potentially worsen.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Again, Ross is experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway can still treat him if he identifies the disease correctly.

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway realizes that both patients are experiencing Unknown symptoms, which means he cannot definitively diagnose them. However, he decides to treat both patients with antibiotics, as it is a safer option that could potentially help if either has Flaze.

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which reduces his workload to 1. Since Jones is alive, he survives the treatment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics as well. This also reduces his workload to 0, and since Ross is alive, he too survives the treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. He admits Young to Patient Room C and assesses him. Young is also experiencing Unknown, but Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the treatment for Jarkis. Young survives the treatment as well.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
