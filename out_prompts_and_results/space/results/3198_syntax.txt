To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard while avoiding the dangers of the erupting volcano. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Zoe achieve her goals:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to get to a safer location away from the erupting volcano and to be closer to the Lizard, which is essential for building a friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she takes the opportunity to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, as both characters are currently not fighting and have a positive relationship.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship. This action ensures her safety, as the surface is still dangerous due to the volcano.
