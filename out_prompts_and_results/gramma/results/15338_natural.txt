To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her coins in the chest.

2. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The story is short because the bandit already has a clear path to her goal without needing to interact with other characters or locations further. The bandit simply needs to return to her camp and collect the coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This is necessary for the bandit to access her stash of coins, which is her primary goal.
- **Looting the coins**: This action directly fulfills the bandit's desire to have coins, either in her possession or in the chest.
