To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard. 
   - **Explanation**: By reporting the bandit, the merchant can help the guard eliminate the threat, which will allow her to operate freely in the market without fear of being robbed or attacked. This action also positions the merchant as a law-abiding citizen, which aligns with her goal of not becoming a criminal.

2. The guard walks from the market to the crossroads to confront the bandit.
   - **Explanation**: The guard needs to move to the crossroads to deal with the bandit, who is a criminal. This action is necessary for the guard to fulfill his role of killing criminals.

3. The guard attacks and kills the bandit.
   - **Explanation**: This action directly removes the bandit from the story, ensuring that the merchant is no longer at risk of losing her items or being threatened. The bandit’s death also allows the merchant to potentially loot the bandit’s items later.

4. The merchant loots an item from the corpse of the dead bandit.
   - **Explanation**: After the bandit is dead, the merchant can take the hero's coin that the bandit looted earlier. This action helps the merchant acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as she is looting from a dead criminal.

5. The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.
   - **Explanation**: The merchant returns to her preferred location, the market, where she can continue her business and potentially sell the medicine she has.

By following these actions, the merchant successfully increases her coin count while adhering to her moral code.
