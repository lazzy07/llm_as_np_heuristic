**Story Completion:**

As day one progresses, Roy realizes that he needs to help Ernest and protect both of them from the bully. He decides to take action.

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where the bully is and to potentially lock him in.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without the risk of being threatened.)
3. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, giving him the element of surprise.)
4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)
5. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, making it easier for him to escape without being recognized.)
6. **Roy goes to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

At this point, Roy has successfully eliminated the bully, disguised himself, and is now on the highway, ready to escape. Ernest is safe, and Roy has achieved his goal of staying alive and free.
