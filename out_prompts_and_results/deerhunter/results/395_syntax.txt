To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a rifle and ammunition, and he is greedy for money. The bank clerk also has money, which Bubba desires. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to threaten the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills Bubba's greed and ensures he has the money.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money, and the bank clerk is dead, which satisfies the conditions of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is essential for Bubba to be able to shoot the clerk. Without a loaded rifle, he cannot threaten or harm anyone.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action directly leads to the clerk's death, allowing Bubba to take the money without facing any opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money, fulfilling his greed.
