**Story Completion:**

After Ernest's chores in the laundry, he finds himself in the gym, where he is currently threatened by the bully. Knowing that the bully is in the cells and that he needs to act quickly, Ernest decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from entering. This action is crucial as it gives him a moment of safety and control over the situation.

Next, Ernest crawls through the vents to the hallway, where he can access the kitchen. He knows that the knife is located there, and he needs it to defend himself against the bully. Once in the kitchen, he retrieves the knife, which is essential for his survival and potential revenge against the bully.

With the knife in hand, Ernest returns to the gym, where he finds the bully still outside. He takes the opportunity to get revenge by killing the bully. This action is necessary to eliminate the threat that the bully poses to both him and Roy.

Finally, with the bully dead, Ernest can now escape the prison. He goes to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he found in the laundry, and makes his way to the highway. This final action ensures his freedom and survival, achieving his goal of being alive and no longer threatened.
