Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the volcano. She knows she needs to make friends with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and being safe.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure they are both in a safer location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and keeps them both safe from the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
