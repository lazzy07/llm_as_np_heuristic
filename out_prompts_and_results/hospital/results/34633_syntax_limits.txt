In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in a position where they need to treat the patients effectively to ensure their health. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat another patient without reducing their workload first. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what disease Ross may have and to avoid any mistakes in treatment due to the high workload.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. Assuming Ross has the same symptom as Young (SymptomA), Hathaway will treat him for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make Ross healthy.

3. **Treat Young**: Hathaway then treats Young for the same reason, using antibiotics for Flaze, ensuring that both patients in PatientRoomA are healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, reducing their workload and ensuring that they achieve their goal of having all patients healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
