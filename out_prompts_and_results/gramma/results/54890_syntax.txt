To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Market)**: The Bandit will attack the Guard. This is necessary because the Guard is a threat to the Bandit, and eliminating him will allow the Bandit to operate freely without the risk of being reported or attacked.

2. **loot(Bandit, GuardSword, Guard, Market)**: After successfully attacking the Guard, the Bandit will loot the Guard's sword. This action is important as it provides the Bandit with an additional weapon, enhancing her ability to defend herself against any future threats.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

With these actions, the Bandit successfully eliminates the threat posed by the Guard and secures the coins, achieving her goal.
