To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: Bubba is hungry and needs to find food. He decides to go back to the house where he can potentially find something to eat or plan his next move.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Once Bubba is in the forest, he encounters Bambi. Since Bubba is hungry and Bambi is a deer, he decides to eat Bambi, which will satisfy his hunger and also result in Bambi being dead.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba's hunger is satisfied and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to return to a location where he can either find food or plan his next move. However, since he is already in the forest, this action is not strictly necessary for the final outcome but sets the stage for the next action.
  
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the required outcomes. It also satisfies Bubba's hunger, making it a logical choice for him.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, House)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcome with minimal actions.
