**Story Completion:**

The bandit, seeing the hero at the market with the medicine, decides to take action. She approaches the hero and, with her sword drawn, she robs him, taking the medicine. The hero, unarmed and surprised, cannot defend himself. 

With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit quickly walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her loot and keep the medicine for herself.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Rob the Hero:** The bandit uses her sword to rob the hero, taking the medicine. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins or items as possible, as the medicine is valuable to her.
   
2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp:** After successfully robbing the hero, the bandit walks to the bandit camp. This action is essential for her to secure her loot in a safe location, away from the market where the guard could potentially intervene.
