To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is I1 (the flowers). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where the flowers are located (R22).
   - This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers.
   - This action is essential as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is necessary for their happiness.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12).
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included to show that Alex is returning to a common area where they might interact with others.

4. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves to the bedroom (R11).
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included to show that Alex is moving around the house.

5. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex returns to the dining room (R12).
   - This action is included to show that Alex is still in the vicinity of Casey and Blake, who may also want to achieve their happiness.

At this point, Alex has the flowers (I1) and is happy. The other characters can still pursue their happiness, but the focus is on Alex achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "move(C1, R12, R11)",
    "move(C1, R11, R12)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While not necessary for happiness, it shows Alex's interaction with the space and other characters.
- **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Again, this is not necessary for happiness but shows Alex's movement within the house.
- **move(C1, R11, R12)**: This final move keeps Alex in the vicinity of the other characters, maintaining the social aspect of the story.
