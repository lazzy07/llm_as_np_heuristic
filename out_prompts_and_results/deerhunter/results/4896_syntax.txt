To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants to get more money. The bank clerk is still alive and is at the bank, which presents an opportunity for Bubba to steal money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals from the clerk using the rifle. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal money from the clerk. This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba decides to get money, which solidifies his greed and confirms that he has successfully achieved his goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next actions.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Confirms Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
