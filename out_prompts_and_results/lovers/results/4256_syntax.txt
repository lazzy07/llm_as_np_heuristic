To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Since the current situation indicates that I2 is not in R22, we need to move to the dining room (R12) where I2 is believed to be located. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room to find the item they want (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room.
   - This action is essential for Blake to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Casey are.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be with the other characters after obtaining the item.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey.
   - This action is important because Casey wants the jewelry, and by giving it to Casey, Blake ensures that Casey is happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to go to the dining room to find I2.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the jewelry to fulfill their desire.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room to be with the others.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey, ensuring both characters are happy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C2, R22, R12)",
    "pick_up(C2, I2, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)",
    "give(C2, I2, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want and helping Casey in the process.
