To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. After eating, he can return to the bank to steal the money from the bank clerk, who is unaware of Bubba's actions in the forest.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal of acquiring money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is essential as he needs to be at the bank to confront the bank clerk and steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
