Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and strengthen their friendship.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, where they can discuss their friendship and safety without the immediate threat of the volcano.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they remain together and can continue to build their friendship in a safer environment.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace**: Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and commitment to helping each other stay safe and healthy.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship**: This action is crucial as it allows both characters to escape the dangerous surface and find safety aboard the spaceship, ensuring their health and safety.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
