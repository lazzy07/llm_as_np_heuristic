To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, making him healthy. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will also make him healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- **Assess Ross**: Hathaway walks into Exam Room A and assesses Ross. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which is necessary for the correct treatment.

- **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the correct medication. If Ross has Flaze, he receives antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he receives steroids. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By taking these two actions, Hathaway can effectively treat Ross, leading to a successful outcome for all patients.
