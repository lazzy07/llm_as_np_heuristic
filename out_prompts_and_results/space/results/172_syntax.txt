To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe is currently on the surface and needs to approach the Lizard in the cave to initiate a conversation and potentially make peace. This action is necessary to bring Zoe closer to the Lizard.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she can attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to stop fighting and work towards friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe can walk back to the surface. This action is included to ensure that Zoe is safe and can monitor the situation with the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is no longer on the surface, she remains safe. This action is included to show the danger of the environment and the importance of Zoe's earlier actions in ensuring her safety.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety and allowing her to leave the dangerous environment of the planet. This action is necessary to conclude the story with Zoe being healthy and safe.

The sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goals of safety and friendship with the Lizard while navigating the dangers of the planet.
