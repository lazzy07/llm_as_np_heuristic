Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to find a way to be safe and make friends with the Lizard. Meanwhile, the Lizard, safe in the cave, is also considering how to connect with Zoe.

1. **Zoe teleports to the cave.** - This action allows Zoe to reach the Lizard without angering it, as she is not teleporting back to the ship. By teleporting to the cave, she can directly approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Since they are now in the same location and not fighting, they can choose to become friends. This action aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends.

With these two actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship.
