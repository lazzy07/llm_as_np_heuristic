**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite her heavy workload, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. She enters the room and examines Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload of 3, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, the treatment is incorrect. Fortunately, the treatment does not lead to Jones's demise, as the story requires him to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway, still unaware of the true nature of Jones's condition, reduces her workload by one after the treatment. She then decides to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. 

Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C, where she can assess him next. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms, which is necessary for treatment.
2. **Treat Jones with steroids**: Although this is a mistake due to her workload, it is the only treatment action taken, and it allows Jones to remain alive.
3. **Reduce workload**: This action is necessary to reflect the consequences of treating a patient, even if the treatment was incorrect.
4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: This action is taken to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated later, keeping the story moving forward.
