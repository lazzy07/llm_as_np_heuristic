Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake. However, since Jones is the only patient in Room C, Hathaway focuses on him. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones is the only patient there, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to identify the correct disease and avoid a potential mistake due to the high workload.

2. **Treat Jones**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Exam Room A. This action is important as it reduces Hathaway's workload by one, allowing him to manage the remaining patients more effectively.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B. This further reduces the workload and prepares Hathaway to assess Young in the future.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring he is healthy, and sets up the next steps for Ross and Young.
