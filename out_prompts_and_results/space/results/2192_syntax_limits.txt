Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. However, the surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, which is a safe location. Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, they have already established a peaceful relationship, so the Lizard understands Zoe's need for safety. 

Zoe teleports to the ship, ensuring her safety, while the Lizard remains on the surface, but now they can communicate and plan for future interactions without the immediate danger of the surface.

By teleporting to the ship, Zoe can avoid any potential threats, fulfilling her goal of being healthy and safe. The Lizard, having made peace with Zoe, understands this action and does not become angry.
