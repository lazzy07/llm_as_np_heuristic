The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the guard is present. The bandit then reports her own location to the guard, misleading him into thinking she is at the crossroads. This allows her to create a diversion while she quickly returns to the bandit camp, where she can safely access the coins in the chest.
