After digging up the Ark, Indiana Jones realizes its true nature and the danger it poses. He knows that the Nazis, believing the Ark is safe, will try to take it from him. To prevent this, Indiana decides to travel back to the USA to alert the U.S. Army about the Ark's dangerous nature and its potential for destruction.

Meanwhile, the Nazis, eager to obtain the Ark, attempt to take it by force. They confront Indiana at Tanis, armed and ready to fight.
