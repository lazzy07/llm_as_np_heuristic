**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to help Ernest. He knows that the bully is in the gym and is threatening Ernest. Roy decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards while he plans his next move.

Next, Roy sneaks back through the vent to the gym. He knows that if he can get to Ernest, they can work together to deal with the bully. Once in the gym, he finds Ernest still being threatened by the bully. Roy quickly assesses the situation and sees the knife on the table from the punishment duties. He grabs the knife, which is essential for their survival.
