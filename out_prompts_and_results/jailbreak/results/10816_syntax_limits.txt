**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that Ernest is in the kitchen with the cigarettes, and the bully is in the gym. Roy quickly moves to the hallway, where he can hear the bully's laughter echoing from the gym. 

Feeling the weight of the knife in his pocket, Roy makes a bold decision. He crawls through the vents to the gym, where he finds the bully alone, lifting weights. With a surge of adrenaline, Roy confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation, he uses the knife to kill the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief wash over him. He knows that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. He quickly returns to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, and makes his way to the highway. 

Once on the highway, Roy escapes from the prison, finally free and alive.
