To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money. The only character with money is the bank clerk, who is currently at the bank. Bubba can go to the bank and steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk, who has the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money** is the action that fulfills Bubba's desire to have 1 money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal.
