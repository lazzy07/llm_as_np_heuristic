The secret agent, holding the papers, is in the lobby. Knowing that the mastermind is likely trying to escape, the secret agent decides to take decisive action. 

1. The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office. This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to find the gun, which is crucial for achieving the goal of killing the mastermind.
   
2. The secret agent discovers the gun in the office. This action is essential as it provides the secret agent with the means to carry out the plan against the mastermind.

3. The secret agent moves from the office back to the lobby. This action is required to confront the mastermind, who is presumed to be nearby.

4. The secret agent kills the mastermind in the lobby. This is the final action that fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is efficient and direct, leading to the desired outcome with minimal steps.
