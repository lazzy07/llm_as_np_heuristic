To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest after having shot and eaten Bambi, and he is aware that the bank clerk has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Go from Forest to Bank**: Bubba needs to move to the bank where the clerk is located to obtain the money.
2. **Steal from Clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the bank clerk.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located. Without this action, he cannot interact with the clerk or obtain the money.
  
2. **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money without any resistance from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money in the shortest possible way while adhering to the constraints of the story.
