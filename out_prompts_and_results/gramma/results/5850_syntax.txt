To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and does not have a sword. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp, where she can store the coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coin she just acquired from Tom and place it in the chest at the bandit camp.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob**: This action is necessary for the bandit to acquire coins from Tom, as he is the only character present with coins and is unarmed.
- **walk**: This action is required to move the bandit from the Crossroads to the bandit camp, where she can secure her coins.
- **take**: This action allows the bandit to store the coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the bandit camp.
