**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A. Since Ross is assigned to Patient Room B, he walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A to see Dr. Hathaway. 

Once Ross arrives, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, but due to the high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis instead of Flaze. She treats Ross with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for Flaze. However, since Ross is healthy and does not have Jarkis, he does not die from the treatment. 

After the treatment, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. Ross, feeling fine, walks back to Patient Room B, where he remains alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Ross walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A**: This action is necessary for Ross to seek help from Dr. Hathaway, as he needs to be assessed and treated.
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross**: This action is crucial for determining Ross's condition, even though it leads to a mistake due to the doctor's high workload.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids**: Although this is the wrong treatment, it is part of the story's progression. Ross does not die because he is healthy, which allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

4. **Ross walks back to Patient Room B**: This action signifies that Ross is still alive and healthy after the treatment, fulfilling his goal.
