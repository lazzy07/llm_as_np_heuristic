Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Jones and Ross to the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones, who is experiencing Fever, is assigned to a room where he can be assessed and treated. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 2.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** This action allows Ross, who is also experiencing Fever, to be assigned to a room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B and observes Fever.** Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but in this case, he correctly identifies Jones's symptoms. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.** This action is crucial as it matches the treatment for Fever, allowing Jones to become healthy. Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C and observes Fever.** Again, due to the workload, there is a risk of error, but he correctly identifies Ross's symptoms.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** This action is also necessary as it matches the treatment for Fever, allowing Ross to become healthy. Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions and observes Rash.** This action is necessary to identify Young's condition correctly.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** This action is essential as it matches the treatment for Rash, allowing Young to become healthy.

By the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
