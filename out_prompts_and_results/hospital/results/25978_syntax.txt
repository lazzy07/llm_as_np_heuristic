To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on his assessment. This is also necessary for Young to become healthy.
