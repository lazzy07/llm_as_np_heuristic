Zoe, the space explorer, is currently in a cave on the planet while the Lizard is on the surface. The surface is dangerous due to a volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard. 

To achieve this, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially make friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: If the Lizard is receptive to Zoe's peace offering, he will walk to the cave with her. This action signifies that they are now friends and can be safe together in the cave.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action highlights the danger of the surface and reinforces the importance of their friendship and safety.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
