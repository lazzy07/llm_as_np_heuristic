To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to get the flowers.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the flowers.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While this does not affect Alex's happiness, it provides a logical conclusion to the story.
