**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Roy realizes that he has the knife and the opportunity to take revenge on the bully. He knows that if he kills the bully, he will no longer be threatened, and he can then escape the prison with the civilian clothes he stole earlier. 

Roy takes a deep breath, grips the knife tightly, and confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he plunges the knife into the bully, ensuring that he is no longer a threat to him or Ernest. With the bully incapacitated, Roy feels a sense of relief wash over him. 

Now that the bully is out of the way, Roy can focus on his escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. With the gym door still locked, he crawls through the vents to the hallway, then makes his way to the highway. 

Once on the highway, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He looks back at the prison, knowing he has successfully escaped.
