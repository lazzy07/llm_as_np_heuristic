To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface from the cave. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard back to the location where the volcano is active, setting the stage for the eruption.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement for the volcano to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both characters.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard dies due to the eruption. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of a character dying as a result of the eruption.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Although the Lizard is dead, this action symbolizes Zoe's intention to make peace with the Lizard, reflecting her desire to be friends with other creatures. It also serves as a narrative closure, indicating that Zoe respects the Lizard and wishes they could have been friends.

The actions are structured to ensure that the volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's death, while also allowing for a symbolic friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, even in death.
