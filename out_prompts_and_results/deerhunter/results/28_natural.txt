Bubba, having stolen the rifle and loaded it with ammunition, stands in the bank with a clear goal: to obtain money. The clerk, who is aware of the situation, is frightened but compliant. 

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** (This action is necessary as it aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and the clerk is a threat to his goal. Shooting the clerk eliminates this threat and allows Bubba to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he desired, and the story concludes with him achieving his goal.
