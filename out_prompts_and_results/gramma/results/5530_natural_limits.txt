The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the market to the crossroads. There, she spots the guard and decides to report her own location, hoping to create a distraction. The guard, believing the bandit is at the market, rushes back to the market to confront her. This leaves the bandit free to return to her camp, where she can safely access the coins in the chest.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads to create distance from the guard and merchant, allowing her to act without immediate threat.
2. The bandit reports her location to the guard, which misleads him and causes him to leave the crossroads.
3. The guard, believing the bandit is still at the market, rushes there, leaving the crossroads unguarded.
4. The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can access the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
