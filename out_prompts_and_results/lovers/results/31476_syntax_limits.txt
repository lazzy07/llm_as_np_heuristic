In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I3). 

Here’s the shortest story where Blake achieves their goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the flowers (I3) they picked up earlier with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to receive the item they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers (I3).
- Blake is happy because they successfully helped Alex achieve happiness.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that both Blake and Alex are happy. By trading the flowers, Blake fulfills their goal of making Alex happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.
