**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to Exam Room C, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway checks Jones for symptoms. Since Jones has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway is unsure but believes he is alive.

Next, Hathaway decides to treat Jones based on the assumption that he might have Flaze, as it is the only disease that could be treated with antibiotics.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway administers antibiotics to Jones. Since Jones does not have Flaze, this treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Now, Hathaway needs to focus on Ross, who is still in the admissions room.

3. **walk(Hathaway, from: PatientRoomA, to: Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross.

4. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B, increasing her workload to 3.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross, who shows no symptoms, but Hathaway believes he is alive.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. Since Ross does not have Jarkis, this treatment is also incorrect, and Ross dies.

Finally, Hathaway turns her attention to Young, who is still in the admissions room.

7. **walk(Hathaway, from: Admissions, to: PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to check on Young.

8. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room A.

9. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young, who shows no symptoms, but Hathaway believes he is alive.

10. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Since Young does not have Flaze, this treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

In the end, Hathaway's actions lead to the unfortunate demise of all patients, despite her intentions to help them.
