Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety and to foster a friendship. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the need for cooperation to survive the volcanic eruption. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure they are both out of immediate danger.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now a friend, follows Zoe into the cave for safety. This action reinforces their new friendship and shared goal of safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are safely in the cave, they are unharmed. This event concludes the immediate danger and solidifies their successful cooperation.

By making peace and moving to safety together, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
