In this story, Zoe is currently on her spaceship, while the Lizard is on the surface of the planet. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve this, Zoe will teleport from the spaceship to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to directly interact with the Lizard and work towards building a friendship. 

Once Zoe teleports to the surface, she will make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it will help to establish a friendly relationship between them, which is one of Zoe's goals. 

However, the volcano is erupting, and the danger is imminent. The story will conclude with the volcano erupting, which will result in the Lizard dying. This outcome is significant because it highlights the urgency of the situation and the consequences of the environment they are in.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard and work towards friendship.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendly relationship.
3. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of the story, where the volcano erupts, and the Lizard dies, while Zoe attempts to make a friend.
