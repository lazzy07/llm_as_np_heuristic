To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex is happy by obtaining the item they want (I1, which is the flowers). Since Alex is already happy, we need to focus on making Casey happy as well, as Alex wants Casey to be happy. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the item they want.

2. **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Casey's desire to be happy by providing them with the item they want (I3, which is the jewelry).

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to join Alex and Casey. This is important for Blake to be part of the resolution and to ensure that everyone is together.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action helps Blake achieve happiness, as they want the chocolates.

Now, let's summarize the happiness status:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey is happy because they received the flowers (I1) from Alex.
- Blake is happy because they received the chocolates (I2) from Casey.

All characters are now happy, fulfilling their desires.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to receive the flowers.
- **give(C1, I1, C2, R21)**: This action directly fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to be present to interact with Casey and Alex.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: This action fulfills Blake's desire, making them happy as well.
