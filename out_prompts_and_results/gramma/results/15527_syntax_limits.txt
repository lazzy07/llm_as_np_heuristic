In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has already attacked Tom, who is now dead. The Bandit can now loot Tom's corpse to take the coin he was carrying.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)** - The Bandit loots Tom's corpse to take the coin he was carrying.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins. Since Tom is dead, the Bandit can take the coin without any resistance.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)"]
}
```
