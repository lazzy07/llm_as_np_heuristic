To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money from the clerk, as he believes the clerk has money and he wants it.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba can then leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but can be included to show Bubba's escape after committing the robbery.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: If we want to ensure that Bambi is dead, Bubba can shoot Bambi in the forest. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is not necessary for achieving the goal but adds to the story's conclusion.
