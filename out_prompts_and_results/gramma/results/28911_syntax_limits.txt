To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. This action directly fulfills his goal of reaching the Cottage with the medicine he looted from the Merchant.

This is the only necessary action for Tom to achieve his goal, as he already has the medicine in his possession.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because it allows Tom to move from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be. Since he already has the medicine, this action completes his objective.
