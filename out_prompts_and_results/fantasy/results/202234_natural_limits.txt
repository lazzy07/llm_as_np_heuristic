In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to ensure she has both happiness and wealth. Since she is already married to Rory and Vince, her happiness is guaranteed through these relationships. However, she needs to increase her wealth.

Here's the sequence of actions that will help Talia achieve her goal:

1. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.** - This action is necessary for Talia to interact with Vince, who has the money. By traveling to the village, she can access the money that will increase her wealth.

2. **Talia takes the money from Vince.** - This action allows Talia to acquire the money that Vince possesses, thus increasing her wealth.

After these actions, Talia will have both happiness (from her marriages) and wealth (from acquiring the money), achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the village**: This is essential for Talia to reach Vince and take the money.
