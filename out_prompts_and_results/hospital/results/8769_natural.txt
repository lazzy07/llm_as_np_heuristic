**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload is still low, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones is also experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.

Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room A. This increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Again, Ross is experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has assessed all patients but still cannot determine their conditions. However, since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat each patient with the treatment for Flaze, as it is the only treatment available that could potentially help.

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics in Patient Room C. Young becomes healthy.

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics in Patient Room B. Jones becomes healthy.

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics in Patient Room A. Ross becomes healthy.
