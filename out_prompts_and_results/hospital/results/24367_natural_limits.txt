Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy. After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross actually has an unknown condition. However, since Ross is alive, he survives the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones and Young. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is still in Admissions. After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is also incorrect since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition. However, since Jones is alive, he survives the treatment as well.

In the end, both patients are alive, and Dr. Hathaway has treated them, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
