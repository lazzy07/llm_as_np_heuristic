To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he may need.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room. This is important because it allows Hathaway to treat Ross based on his symptoms.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: Ross needs to move to the exam room where he has been admitted so that Hathaway can treat him.

4. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Similar to Ross, Young is also in the admissions room and has not been assessed. Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

5. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to an exam room for treatment.

6. **Walk Young to Exam Room B**: Young needs to move to the exam room where he has been admitted.

7. **Treat Jones in Exam Room C**: Since Jones is already in Exam Room C and has been assessed, Hathaway will treat him for his symptoms.

8. **Treat Ross in Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross and determining his symptoms, Hathaway will treat him accordingly.
