Bubba, feeling hungry after his earlier actions, decides to eat Bambi, who is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain energy, which is essential for his survival. However, it does not directly help him achieve his goal of obtaining money. To achieve his goal, Bubba then decides to go back to the bank to confront the clerk.
