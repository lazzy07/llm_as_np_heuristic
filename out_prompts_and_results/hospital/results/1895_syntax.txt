To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. Since Jones has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated afterward, but it does not directly affect Jones's health.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

5. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. Since Ross has SymptomA, he will also be treated with antibiotics.

6. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young can be assessed and treated afterward, but it does not directly affect Jones's health.

7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones and Ross.

8. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. Since Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids.

By following these steps, Jones will be treated correctly and will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy. The other patients will also be treated appropriately, ensuring that all patients are healthy.
