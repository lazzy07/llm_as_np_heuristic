Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, he is able to accurately assess Ross without making a mistake. He discovers that Ross is experiencing a rash, which indicates that Ross has Jarkis. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action is not necessary for Ross's goal but is included to maintain the flow of the story.

Finally, Ross, now healthy, is satisfied that he has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.
