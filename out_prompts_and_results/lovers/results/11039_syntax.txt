To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially obtain the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the living room (R21). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey and Blake will still be in the living room, but their happiness is not the focus of this story.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey and Blake to interact with them.
2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
