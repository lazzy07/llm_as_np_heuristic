1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in the Admissions room and Ross is in PatientRoomA, Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Young to PatientRoomC**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will admit Young to PatientRoomC. This is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.
