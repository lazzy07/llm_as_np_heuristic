To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is necessary because Talia currently has the money, and by removing her from the equation, Rory can take the money without any competition. It also allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger, as he is currently at -1 hunger.

2. **Rory takes the money from Talia's dead body.** - After Gargax eats Talia, Rory can take the money that Talia had. This action increases Rory's wealth and helps him achieve his goal of being wealthy.

3. **Gargax travels back to the cave.** - Gargax needs to leave the village to avoid any further conflict and to return to his lair, where he can rest and not be hungry anymore.

4. **Rory travels to the cave.** - Rory will follow Gargax to the cave, where he can find the treasure that is located there.

5. **Rory picks up the treasure from the cave.** - This action allows Rory to become wealthy by acquiring the treasure, thus fulfilling his goal of being wealthy.

6. **Rory becomes hungry.** - This action is necessary to reflect Rory's state after traveling and picking up the treasure, as he has not eaten.

7. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action is the final step, where Gargax, now at the cave, can eat Rory. This action does not affect Rory's happiness or wealth since he has already achieved his goals before being eaten.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Gargax eats Talia.
