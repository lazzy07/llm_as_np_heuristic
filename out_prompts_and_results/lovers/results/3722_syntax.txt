To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex is happy by obtaining the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Since Alex is already happy (as indicated in the current situation), we need to focus on making sure that Casey and Blake are also happy, as they want to be happy and also want each other to be happy.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be happy, and the chocolates are in the dining room.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room.
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Casey.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be with Casey, as they want to support each other's happiness.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake.
   - This action allows Blake to have the chocolates, which will make them happy.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates in the dining room.
   - This action is not strictly necessary since Casey has already given the chocolates to Blake, but it can signify that Casey is done with the item.

6. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Casey and Blake.
   - This action allows Alex to be with the other characters, ensuring that they are all together.

7. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) with Casey for the chocolates (I2).
   - This action allows Casey to give Blake the chocolates while Blake gives Casey the jewelry, ensuring that both are happy.

At the end of these actions, all characters are happy: Alex has the jewelry they want, Casey has the chocolates they want, and Blake is happy with the trade.
