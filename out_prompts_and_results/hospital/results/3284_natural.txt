**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to treat Jones first since he has already assessed him and knows he has a fever.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** 
   - This action is necessary because Jones is experiencing a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. By treating him with antibiotics, Hathaway can help Jones become healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 1, and Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address Ross, who is still in the admissions room and has unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, as he is already assigned to an exam room.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**
   - This action is necessary because Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and since he is in the same room as Jones, it is logical to treat him for Jarkis, which is a common condition that could be present.

Now, all patients have been treated, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully ensured that both Jones and Young are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Jones was the first priority since he had a clear symptom (fever) and needed immediate attention.
- Admitting Ross was necessary to ensure he could be assessed and treated, as he was still in the admissions room.
- Assessing Young was crucial to determine his condition and ensure he received the appropriate treatment.
- Treating Young for Jarkis was a logical step to ensure he also became healthy, as it is a common condition that could be treated effectively.
