In the living room, Casey realizes that they want the jewelry that Alex has. To achieve their goal, Casey decides to take action. 

**Action: Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry.**

This action is necessary because it directly communicates Casey's desire to Alex, who currently has the jewelry. By expressing this desire, Casey hopes to initiate a trade or a give-and-take situation that could lead to them obtaining the jewelry.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex now knows that Casey wants the jewelry, which may prompt Alex to consider giving it to Casey or trading it for the flowers.
- Blake remains in the living room, but their happiness is not directly affected by this action.

**Final Situation:**
- Alex is still not happy, but they are now aware of Casey's desire for the jewelry.
- Blake is still not happy.
- Casey is now happy because they have expressed their desire for the jewelry, which is the first step toward achieving their goal.
