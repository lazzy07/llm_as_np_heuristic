To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the items available in the cave. Since both Rory and Vince have proposed to Talia, she can choose to accept one of their proposals, which will make her happy. Additionally, Vince has money, which can contribute to Talia's wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.
2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village, leaving Talia and Vince in the cave.
3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave, which increases her wealth.
4. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure.

Now, Talia is happy because she accepted Rory's proposal, and she is also wealthy because she picked up the treasure.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Talia's desire for happiness by accepting a marriage proposal.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory's departure is necessary to allow Talia to interact with Vince without the complication of multiple proposals.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her goals.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village, completing her journey with both happiness and wealth.
