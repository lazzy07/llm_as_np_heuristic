To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and by doing so, Rory will no longer be alive, which will allow Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth (by taking the treasure Rory has). Although this action seems detrimental to Rory, it ultimately leads to Rory's goal of wealth through the treasure he possesses.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth.

3. **Gargax travels to the village**: Gargax will then travel to the village, where he can use the treasure to fulfill his own desires.

4. **Vince becomes hungry**: Vince, who is at the village, will become hungry, which is a necessary step to show that he is not satisfied with his current state.

5. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax will then eat Vince, which allows Gargax to fulfill his hunger and also take the money that Vince has.

6. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money from Vince's dead body, thus achieving his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

In this story, Rory's goal of being wealthy is achieved through the actions of Gargax, who ultimately benefits from the treasure Rory had. Rory's happiness is not directly achieved through his actions but rather through the circumstances that lead to Gargax's fulfillment of his desires.
