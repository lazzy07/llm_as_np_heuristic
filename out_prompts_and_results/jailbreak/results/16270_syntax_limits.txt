**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy stealthily crawls through the vents and makes his way to the highway. Once he reaches the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he feels a surge of hope and confidence. He knows that this is his chance to escape the prison and leave behind the threats of the bully and the confines of prison life. 

Roy takes a deep breath and steps onto the highway, successfully escaping from the prison.
