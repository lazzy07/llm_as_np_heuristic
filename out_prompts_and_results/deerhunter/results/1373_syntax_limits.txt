To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary because he needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money, and it also fulfills the condition of Bambi being alive or dead since Bambi is not directly involved in this action.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money from the clerk. This action ensures that Bubba ends up with the money he desires.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money and fulfills the requirement of the story.
