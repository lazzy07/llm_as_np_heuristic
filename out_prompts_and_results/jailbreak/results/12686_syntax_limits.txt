**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the cells and that he needs to protect himself and Roy. 

1. **Action: Go to the Hallway (Ernest)** - Ernest moves from the laundry room to the hallway to find a way to help Roy and escape the threat posed by the bully.
   
2. **Action: Vent (Ernest)** - From the hallway, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the gym where Roy is located. He knows that Roy is in danger and needs to warn him about the bully.

3. **Action: Lock Gym (Ernest)** - Once in the gym, Ernest locks the door to prevent the bully from entering and threatening them. This ensures their safety and gives them time to plan their next move.

With the gym locked, both Ernest and Roy can now strategize their escape without the immediate threat of the bully. They can wait for the right moment to make their move.

- **Vent:** Crawling through the vents allows Ernest to bypass the bully and reach Roy without confrontation, keeping both of them safe.
