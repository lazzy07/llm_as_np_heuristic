To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - Bubba is greedy and wants to have money, so he will take action to acquire it.
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located to steal the money.
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This movement is essential for Bubba to reach the clerk and execute the theft.
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, achieving the story's goal.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will still be confirmed dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.
