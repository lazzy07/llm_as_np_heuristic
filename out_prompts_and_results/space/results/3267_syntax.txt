To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard will attempt to make peace with Zoe. Since they are both on the surface and not fighting, this action can help improve their relationship and establish a friendly connection.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk back to the cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to find a safe place away from the danger of the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action ensures that both characters are in the same safe location, further solidifying their friendship.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

By taking these actions, the Lizard successfully achieves its goals of safety and friendship with Zoe.
