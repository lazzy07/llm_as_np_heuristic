To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on friendly terms, the next step is to ensure they both remain safe from the dangers of the surface, particularly the volcano.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve Zoe's goals:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe anticipates that the volcano might erupt soon, so she decides to initiate the eruption to create a sense of urgency for both her and the Lizard to find safety.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is, ensuring they are both in a safe location away from the impending eruption.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe reinforces their friendship with the Lizard, ensuring they are allies and can work together for their safety.

This sequence of actions ensures that both Zoe and the Lizard are safe from the dangers of the surface and solidifies their friendship.
