Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having made peace and become friends. However, the surface is still dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To ensure their safety and to explore the planet further, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship to gather supplies and information about the volcano. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to access resources that can help her and the Lizard understand the volcano's behavior and ensure their safety.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship back to the cave.** - Zoe returns to the cave to share her findings with the Lizard. However, this action makes the Lizard angry because it feels that Zoe is not respecting the surface's dangers.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard begin to fight.** - This action is a result of the Lizard's anger. They are no longer friends during the fight, which creates tension.

4. **The Lizard stuns Zoe.** - The Lizard, wanting to protect itself and the cave, stuns Zoe to prevent her from taking further actions that could endanger them both.

5. **Zoe breaks free from being stunned.** - After a moment, Zoe manages to break free, realizing that fighting is not the solution.

6. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again.** - Understanding the Lizard's perspective, Zoe apologizes and they reconcile, reaffirming their friendship.

7. **The volcano erupts.** - As they are making peace, the volcano on the surface erupts, causing chaos.
