In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire money and ensure he is not hungry. Since he already has no money and is currently in the Village, he can take the following actions:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory travels to the Cave where Talia is located. This is necessary because Talia has the Treasure, which Rory can use to propose marriage to her, thus increasing his happiness.

2. **Propose marriage to Talia**: Rory proposes to Talia, who has already accepted his proposal. This action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

After these actions, Rory will be happy due to his marriage to Talia, and since he has no money but is not hungry, he can focus on his happiness.
