To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). The following actions will be taken to achieve this:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R12)**: This action is necessary because Casey needs to have the item they want to be happy.

2. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R12)**: This action is included to reinforce Casey's desire for the jewelry, ensuring that Alex is aware of what Casey wants.

3. **Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake in the living room (R12)**: This action is included to allow Blake to have the jewelry, which is necessary for Blake's happiness.

4. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) back to Casey in the living room (R12)**: This action is included to ensure that Casey ultimately receives the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions in the story:

1. **pick_up(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry.
2. **tell(C3, C1, I3, R12)**: Casey tells Alex they want the jewelry.
3. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.
4. **give(C2, I3, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry back to Casey.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they want, making them happy.
