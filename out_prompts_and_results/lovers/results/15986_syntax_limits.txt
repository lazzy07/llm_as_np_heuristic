To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in R22). Since Alex is currently in R12 and I3 is in R22, the simplest action for Alex to take is to move to R22 and pick up I3.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This action is necessary for Alex to reach the item they want.
2. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the item I3 (which is in R22). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the item they want (I3).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to access the location where I3 is located.
- **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: This action allows Alex to acquire the item they want, fulfilling their desire for happiness.
