To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3), and Alex is unhappy because they want the flowers (I1). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R11, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R11) to the living room (R12) where Alex and the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve their goal.

2. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Blake actually wants the jewelry (I2). However, this action is necessary to manipulate the situation to help Alex and ultimately themselves.

3. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to get the chocolates (I2) based on Blake's misleading information. This is necessary for Alex to try to fulfill their own desire.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake follows Alex to the dining room (R21) to ensure they can trade items once Alex picks up the chocolates.

5. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This is necessary for the next action.

6. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Alex for the chocolates (I2). This is the key action that allows Blake to achieve their goal of happiness.

7. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R12) after the trade. This action is not necessary for Blake's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story.

8. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R12) after the trade to be with Alex.

At the end of these actions, Blake has the jewelry (I2) and is happy, achieving their goal.
