To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions in the cave where the treasure is located. Since Talia is already married to Vince, her happiness is tied to her relationship with him. She also has some money, which contributes to her wealth. The goal is to acquire the treasure in the cave, which will increase her wealth and potentially her happiness.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with Vince and solidify her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Although Talia is already married to Vince, this action can be interpreted as a reaffirmation of their bond, which can enhance her happiness. However, since they are already married, this action may not be strictly necessary but can symbolize her commitment.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **pickup**: Talia needs to acquire the treasure to increase her wealth.
- **travel**: Talia needs to return to the village to be with Vince, which is essential for her happiness.
- **marry**: This action reaffirms her relationship with Vince, contributing to her happiness.

After these actions, Talia will have both the treasure and the money, fulfilling her goals of being happy and wealthy.
