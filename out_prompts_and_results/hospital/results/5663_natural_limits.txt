Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway confirms that Ross is experiencing a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C, as Young is still in Admissions and has not been assigned to an exam room yet. Dr. Hathaway's workload is now at 2, allowing for the admission without risk of error. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease but will treat him with antibiotics, the treatment for Flaze, as a precaution. This action is taken to ensure that Jones is treated, even if the symptoms are unknown, as it is better to attempt treatment than to leave him untreated.

With these actions, all patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
