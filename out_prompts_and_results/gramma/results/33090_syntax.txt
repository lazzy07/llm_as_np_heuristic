To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the camp, so she will walk to the crossroads to interact with the other characters.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying the medicine but not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the camp to secure her coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit starts at the camp and needs to move to the crossroads to interact with Tom, who has a coin.
- Robbing Tom is essential because it allows the bandit to gain a coin without any risk of retaliation, as Tom is unarmed.
- Walking back to the camp is necessary to secure her newly acquired coin and to ensure she is not caught by the guard.
- Taking the coins from the chest at the camp finalizes her goal of having as many coins as possible.
