To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the bank with the rifle loaded. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money. He is currently hungry and has no money, so stealing is a logical choice.
   
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk without any resistance.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
