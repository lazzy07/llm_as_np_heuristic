To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is what they want to be happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While this does not affect Alex's happiness, it provides a logical conclusion to the scene.
