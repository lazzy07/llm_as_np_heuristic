To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows Zoe to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is one of her goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving her goals but can be seen as a way to explore and ensure safety from the erupting volcano.

4. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will return to the surface to ensure she is still in contact with the Lizard and to maintain their friendship.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship. This action ensures her safety as the volcano is erupting, and she can remain healthy and safe in her ship.

The sequence of actions ensures that Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard while navigating the dangers of the planet.
