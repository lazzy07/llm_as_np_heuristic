Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realizes that he has the knife and the cigarettes. Knowing that the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest, he decides to take action. 

**Action:** Roy kills the bully with the knife.

This action is necessary because it eliminates the immediate threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Roy and Ernest can remain alive and safe. With the bully dead, Roy can now focus on escaping the prison without fear of being threatened.

After killing the bully, Roy can now escape the gym, and he can later help Ernest escape as well.
