Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing Young in Patient Room A first, as Young is already assigned there. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition, leading to Young's recovery.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to admit Jones and Ross to their respective exam rooms. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients receive the attention they need.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and can then focus on admitting the other patients, ensuring that they will also receive care.
