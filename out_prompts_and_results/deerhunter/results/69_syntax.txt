To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and get the money. This action is necessary as it moves Bubba closer to his goal of obtaining money.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is crucial because it gives him the means to threaten the bank clerk and take the money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba then shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken to eliminate the threat and ensure that he can take the money without resistance.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his goal of obtaining money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, and Bambi remains alive, as the actions taken do not involve Bambi.
