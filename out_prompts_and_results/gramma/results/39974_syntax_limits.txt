In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has a sword, while Tom has just been attacked and is now dead. The Bandit can take advantage of this situation to achieve her goal.

1. **Loot**: The Bandit loots Tom's corpse to take the coin he was carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the market or engage in further conflict.

2. **Take**: The Bandit takes the coins she looted from Tom and places them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The story is short and efficient, with only two actions needed for the Bandit to achieve her goal.
