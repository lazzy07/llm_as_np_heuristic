To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on friendly terms, the next step is to ensure they can both be safe from the dangers of the surface, particularly the potential eruption of the volcano. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve Zoe's goals:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action will simulate the volcano starting to erupt, creating an immediate danger for both Zoe and the Lizard.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave to escape the danger of the eruption.
3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave to escape the eruption.
4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once both characters are in the cave, they can solidify their friendship and ensure they are both safe together.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to create a sense of urgency and danger, prompting both characters to seek safety.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe needs to move to a safer location (the cave) to avoid the eruption.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard must also move to the cave to ensure its safety, reinforcing the idea that they are both looking out for each other.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This final action solidifies their friendship, achieving Zoe's goal of making friends while ensuring both characters are safe.
