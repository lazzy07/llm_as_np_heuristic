In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to acquire wealth, which can be done by obtaining the treasure that Rory currently possesses. 

Here's the completed story:

1. Talia travels from the cave to the village. (This action is necessary for Talia to leave the cave where she is currently located and go to the village where Vince is, as she needs to strategize her next move.)
2. Talia proposes to Rory. (This action is taken because Talia wants to secure a relationship with Rory, who has the treasure, and by proposing, she can create a bond that may lead to her acquiring the treasure.)
3. Rory accepts Talia's proposal. (This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness through marriage, as Rory's acceptance means they are now married.)
4. Talia takes the treasure from Rory. (This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.)
5. Talia's happiness increases as she is now married to Rory and has the treasure, fulfilling her goal of being happy and wealthy.
