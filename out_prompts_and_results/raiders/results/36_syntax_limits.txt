To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will take place:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, USA)**: The US Army, being armed and aware that the Nazis have the Ark, will take the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is necessary because the US Army wants the Ark, and the Nazis are currently in possession of it. Since the Nazis are dead after opening the Ark, they cannot resist this action.

2. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army will then open the Ark. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, the goal of the story is to ensure the Ark is in the possession of the US Army, and the Nazis are already dead from their previous action of opening the Ark.

The sequence of actions ensures that the US Army ends up with the Ark while the Nazis are eliminated, fulfilling the story's requirements.
