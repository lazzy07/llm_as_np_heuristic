To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to get rid of the bandit who is currently at the crossroads with him. The simplest way to do this is for Tom to attack the bandit, as he is armed with a sword. After defeating the bandit, Tom can then walk to the cottage with the medicine.

Here’s the complete story with the necessary actions:

1. **attack(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)**: Tom attacks the bandit, who is a criminal and poses a threat to him. Since Tom is armed and the bandit is not, this action is successful, and the bandit is killed.

2. **loot(Tom, BanditSword, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After defeating the bandit, Tom loots the bandit for any items. He finds the bandit's sword, which he can use for future protection.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: With the bandit defeated and the medicine still in his possession, Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine while eliminating the threat posed by the bandit.
