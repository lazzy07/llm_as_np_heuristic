To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe will walk to the Cave.** This action is necessary for Zoe to explore the Lizard's home and show her willingness to understand the Lizard's environment, which can help in building a friendship.

2. **Zoe will make peace with the Lizard in the Cave.** This action is crucial as it solidifies their friendship. By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to ensure their safety and health, especially with the volcano erupting.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard will walk back to the Surface together.** This action allows them to stay together and support each other as they navigate the dangerous environment caused by the volcano.

4. **Zoe will teleport to the Ship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the volcano erupts. By leaving the surface, she avoids the danger of being harmed by the eruption.

5. **The Lizard will walk to the Cave.** This action allows the Lizard to return to a safer location, away from the erupting volcano, ensuring its safety.

6. **The volcano will erupt.** This event is included to show the danger of the surface and the necessity of the previous actions taken by both characters to ensure their safety.
