To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to find the Merchant and rob her of the coins she has. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant of her coins. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of acquiring more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This is necessary to position herself for the next action.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal without unnecessary actions.
