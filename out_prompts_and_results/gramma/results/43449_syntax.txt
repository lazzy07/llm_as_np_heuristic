To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin that Tom has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently carrying a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to place the stolen coin in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coin from her inventory and place it in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest.
