To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Talia is in the cave with Gargax, making her a viable target. This action will also eliminate Talia, who is not focused on wealth and is not a threat to Gargax's goal.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: After eating Talia, Gargax will travel to the Village where Vince is located. Gargax will then take the money from Vince, who is not wealthy and does not care about being rich. This action will increase Gargax's wealth.

3. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax will return to the Cave and eat Rory, who is also in the cave. This action will ensure Gargax is not hungry anymore, as Gargax will have consumed another human.

At the end of these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (by taking the money from Vince) and not hungry (by eating Talia and Rory).
