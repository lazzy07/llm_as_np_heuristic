**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing the urgency of the situation, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to Hathaway's workload being 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway proceeds with the assessment to determine the symptoms. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: After assessing, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload and treats him with steroids. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment for Jones, who actually has Flaze. As a result, Jones dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now aware of the situation with Jones, walks to the admissions room to assess Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 3 again.

5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to the workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis.

6. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment, and Ross becomes healthy.

7. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Young.

8. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.

9. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. 

10. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young becomes healthy.

In the end, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring that all patients who can be treated are healthy.
