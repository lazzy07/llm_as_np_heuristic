**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a rash, correctly identifies that Jones has Jarkis. To ensure Jones receives the appropriate treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Jones in Patient Room A.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** This action is necessary because Jones is showing symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), and treating him with steroids will make him healthy. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, he can treat Jones without making a mistake.

After treating Jones, he becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address Ross and Young, who are still in the admissions room and have unknown symptoms. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross and Young, as they are currently in the admissions room.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway needs to assess him to decide on the next steps.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.** This action is also necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Like Ross, Young's symptoms are unknown, and Hathaway needs to assess him to provide appropriate treatment.

After assessing both Ross and Young, suppose Ross is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze) and Young is also found to have a fever (indicating Flaze).

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Ross has been diagnosed with Flaze, and treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Young has also been diagnosed with Flaze, and treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy.

At this point, all patients (Jones, Ross, and Young) are now healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients based on their symptoms. The sequence ensures that all patients are treated correctly without any mistakes, as Hathaway's workload remains manageable throughout the process.
