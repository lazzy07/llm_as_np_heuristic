To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a loaded rifle, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. Bubba's greed is high, and he wants to take money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only character with money, and Bubba needs to ensure he can take it without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to consume the body of the clerk, which is a necessary step since he is hungry.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can now decide to take the money from the clerk's body. This action is necessary to fulfill his greed and achieve his goal of having money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger by consuming the clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Ensures Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money.
