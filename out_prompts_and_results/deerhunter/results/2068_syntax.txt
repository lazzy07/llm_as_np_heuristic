To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, which means he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can obtain from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings Bubba closer to his goal of obtaining money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to achieve his greedy goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
