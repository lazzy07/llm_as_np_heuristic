To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from their current location (R12)**: This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry to be happy. Since they are currently in the same room as the jewelry, they can pick it up.

2. **Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1) in the same room (R12)**: This action is necessary because Alex is currently unhappy and wants the flowers (I1). By giving the jewelry to Alex, Casey can help Alex achieve their happiness, which is also part of Casey's goal.

3. **Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the same room (R12)**: This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers to be happy. Since the flowers are in the same room, Alex can pick them up.

4. **Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3) in the same room (R12)**: This action is necessary because it allows Casey to receive the flowers, which will make them happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **pick_up(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry.
2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex.
3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers.
4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey.

After these actions, all characters will be happy because:
- Casey has the flowers (I1) they want.
- Alex has the jewelry (I3) they want.
- Blake is not directly involved in this exchange but is happy because Alex is happy.
