Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to accurately assess Young without making a mistake. After assessing, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Jones to Exam Room B. Since Jones is still in Admissions and has unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway can admit Jones without increasing the workload to a level that would cause a mistake.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B. After assessing, Dr. Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating that Jones has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Jones healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
