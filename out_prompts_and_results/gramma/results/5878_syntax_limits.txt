In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp with a sword, while Tom is at the Market with the Medicine. The Bandit is also at the Camp, and the Guard is at the Market.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following actions:

1. **Rob the Bandit**: The Merchant can use her sword to rob the Bandit, who is not armed with a sword. This action allows the Merchant to take the Bandit's coins, increasing her wealth without committing a crime, as the Bandit is already a criminal.

2. **Walk to the Market**: After robbing the Bandit, the Merchant can walk to the Market to ensure she is in a safe location and can continue her business without the threat of the Bandit.
