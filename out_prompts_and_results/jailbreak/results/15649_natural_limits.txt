**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Ernest remained in the kitchen, unaware of the danger that Roy faced in the gym. The bully, having just finished his workout, was looking for Roy, who had stolen his cigarettes earlier. 

Roy, feeling the pressure of the bully's threats, decided to take action. He quickly moved through the gym, looking for a way to defend himself. He spotted a knife on the kitchen counter during a brief moment of distraction from the bully. Knowing he needed to act fast, he crawled through the vents to the kitchen, retrieved the knife, and then returned to the gym.

With the knife in hand, Roy confronted the bully. The bully, surprised by Roy's sudden appearance and armed state, attempted to threaten him again. But Roy, fueled by fear and desperation, lunged at the bully and killed him in a moment of self-defense.

With the bully now dead, Roy quickly realized he needed to escape. He remembered the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier. He rushed back to the hallway, put on the civilian clothes to disguise himself, and then made his way to the highway outside the prison. 

Ernest, still in the kitchen, was unaware of the events unfolding in the gym. He believed Roy was still in danger, but with the bully gone, Roy had successfully escaped.
