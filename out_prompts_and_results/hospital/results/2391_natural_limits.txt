Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their conditions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess him for any symptoms he may have. This action also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial for determining Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but for the sake of the story, we will assume that Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Ross has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2.

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Young, who is also in the admissions room, to ensure he receives the necessary treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Assuming Young has a fever, Dr. Hathaway will treat him accordingly.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - This treatment will make Young healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, ensuring they are healthy.
