Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. Since Jones, Ross, and Young are all experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway needs to admit them to the exam rooms to provide treatment.

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** (Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze with antibiotics.** (Assuming Young has a fever, this treatment will make Young healthy.)
