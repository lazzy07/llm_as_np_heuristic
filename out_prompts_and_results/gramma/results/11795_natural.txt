   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the market where he can interact with the merchant and obtain the medicine.

2. **The hero (Tom) attacks the bandit.**

3. **The hero (Tom) reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action will alert the guard to the presence of the bandit, who is a criminal. The guard can then take action against the bandit.

   - After defeating the bandit, the guard can take the bandit's sword, ensuring that the bandit cannot return to threaten Tom or the merchant.

7. **The guard walks to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard now has the opportunity to secure the area and ensure that Tom can safely retrieve the medicine.

8. **The hero (Tom) walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - Tom returns to the crossroads where the merchant's body is located.
