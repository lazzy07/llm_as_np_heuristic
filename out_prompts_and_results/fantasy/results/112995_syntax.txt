To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has already accepted proposals from both Vince and Rory, which means she is in a position to marry either of them. Since Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy, marrying Vince, who has money, will help her achieve both happiness and wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the desired ending:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the Village where Vince is located. This is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as Vince to marry him.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action will make Talia happy because she is now married to someone she accepted a proposal from.

3. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: After marrying Vince, Talia can now take the money that Vince has. This will make her wealthy.

Now, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage) and wealthy (due to acquiring the money).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Talia to be in the same location as Vince to proceed with the marriage.
- **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness as she is now married to Vince.
- **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: This action allows Talia to become wealthy by acquiring the money that Vince possesses.
