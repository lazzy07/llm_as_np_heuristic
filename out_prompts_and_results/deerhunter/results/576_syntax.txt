To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition. He needs to load the rifle to be able to use it effectively, either to threaten the bank clerk or to hunt Bambi.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After loading the rifle, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and potentially steal the money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will shoot the clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

5. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can return to the forest with the money, ensuring he is away from the scene of the crime.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while also eliminating the bank clerk, which is a necessary step for him to achieve his goal.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba takes the money from the bank after the clerk is incapacitated.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba retreats to the forest with the money, completing his goal.
