In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to acquire wealth and ensure her happiness. Since she is already engaged to Vince, who has money, she can take a strategic action to secure her happiness and wealth.

1. **Action: travel(Talia, Village, Cave)** - Talia travels to the Cave where Rory is located. This is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as Rory to interact with him and to potentially acquire the treasure he has.

2. **Action: take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)** - Talia takes the treasure from Rory. This action is crucial because acquiring the treasure will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

3. **Action: marry(Vince, Talia, Village)** - Talia marries Vince. This action ensures that Talia achieves happiness through her relationship with Vince, as they are now married.

By taking these actions, Talia successfully achieves her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).
