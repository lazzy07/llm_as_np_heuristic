To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to head towards the cottage. This action is necessary to get closer to his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom continues on to the cottage. This is the final step to reach his destination.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is essential because Tom must leave the market where he currently is. He cannot go directly to the cottage from the market, so he must first go to the crossroads.

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action takes Tom from the crossroads to the cottage, which is his ultimate goal. By reaching the cottage, he successfully carries the medicine there.

With these two actions, Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
