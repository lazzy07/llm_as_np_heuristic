To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **put_down(C1, I3, R21)**: Alex puts down the flowers (I3) they were holding in the dining room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps to keep the story concise and focused on the goal.

4. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R12). This action is not necessary for achieving the goal but helps to illustrate Alex's movement.

5. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R12). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn contributes to Alex's happiness.

6. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2). This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but helps to show Casey's actions.

7. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R21). This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but helps to illustrate Casey's happiness.

8. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C3) in the dining room (R21). This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but helps to show the interconnected happiness of the characters.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the jewelry (I1) and is happy, achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
