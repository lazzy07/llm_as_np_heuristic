To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both patients effectively, ensuring they are healthy.
