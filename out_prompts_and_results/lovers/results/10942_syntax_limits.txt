In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (the jewelry), and Casey currently has it. Since Casey is already happy with I3, Blake needs to help Alex get I3 to make both of them happy.

To achieve this, Blake can trade the item they have (I2, the chocolates) with Casey for I3. This action will ensure that Alex receives the item they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **trade(Blake, I2, Casey, I3, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it directly helps Blake achieve their goal of making Alex happy by ensuring Alex gets the item they want.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have I3.
- Blake will also be happy because they successfully helped Alex.
- Casey will still be happy with I2.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(Blake, I2, Casey, I3, R21)"]
}
