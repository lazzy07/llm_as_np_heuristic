In this story, Indiana Jones (Jones) aims to ensure that the US Army possesses the Ark of the Covenant, which he has successfully given to them. The Nazis, who sought immortality through the Ark, have already met their demise after attempting to open it, which was dangerous. The US Army is now in possession of the Ark, but it is dangerous, and Jones needs to ensure that it remains with them without any further risk.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Jones** is already in the USA and has given the Ark to the US Army. Since the Ark is dangerous, he needs to ensure that it is not opened by anyone else, especially since the Nazis are dead and cannot pose a threat anymore.

2. **Jones** takes a moment to assess the situation. He knows that the US Army believes the Ark is safe, but he understands the risks involved. To prevent any further attempts to open the Ark, he decides to stay close to the US Army and monitor the situation.

3. **Jones** remains vigilant and communicates with the US Army about the dangers of the Ark, ensuring they understand the risks involved in opening it. He emphasizes that the Ark should be kept secure and not tampered with.

4. The US Army, now aware of the dangers, decides to keep the Ark secured and not attempt to open it, thus fulfilling Jones's goal of ensuring the Ark remains with them without any risk of it being opened.

In this way, Jones achieves his goal of having the US Army possess the Ark while ensuring it remains safe from danger.
