Here we are solving a problem for a forward-chaining state-space narrative planning system that models both the intentions of the author (i.e. the system designer’s constraints on the solution) as well as the intentions and beliefs of each virtual character. This system finds plans that improve the author’s utility but are only composed of actions that can be explained by the intentions and beliefs of the characters who take them. In this system, agents can have arbitrarily nested and wrong beliefs, but must always commit to specific beliefs.
