To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia is currently in a position where she has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, but she has not yet married either of them. Since she has no money or treasure, she needs to secure wealth to be happy.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave where the Treasure is located. This is necessary because she needs to acquire wealth to be happy.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the Treasure. This action is essential as it directly contributes to her wealth.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the Village with the Treasure. This is necessary to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and Vince.

4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. This action makes both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

5. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action also makes Talia happy, and since she has the Treasure, she is now wealthy.

By marrying both Rory and Vince, Talia achieves her goal of happiness through relationships, and by picking up the Treasure, she achieves her goal of wealth.
