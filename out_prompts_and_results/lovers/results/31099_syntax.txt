To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up and eventually give it to Alex.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This is essential as it allows Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

3. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room to be with Alex and Casey. This is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to create a sense of togetherness.

6. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates. This action is included to show Blake's desire for happiness, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "give(C3, I1, C1, R12)",
    "move(C2, R22, R12)",
    "tell(C2, C3, I2, R12)"
  ]
}
```
