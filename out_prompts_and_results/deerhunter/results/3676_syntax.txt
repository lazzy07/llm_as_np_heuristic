To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides a logical conclusion to the story, showing Bubba escaping with the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who has the money, thus making it possible for Bubba to take the money without resistance.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money after the clerk has been shot, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action concludes the story by showing Bubba leaving the scene with the money.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's goal.
