To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit will walk to the market where the merchant is located. This is necessary because the merchant has coins that the bandit can potentially acquire.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The bandit will rob the merchant to take the coins she is carrying. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk back to the crossroads. This is necessary to return to a location where she can decide her next move.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest. This action ensures that the coins are safely stored, fulfilling her goal.
