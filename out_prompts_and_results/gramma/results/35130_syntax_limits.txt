To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying a coin. This action allows the bandit to take one coin from Tom, increasing her total coins.

2. **Take from Chest**: The bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring she has the maximum amount of coins possible.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit successfully robs Tom, taking one coin from him. This action is necessary for the bandit to increase her coin count without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action allows her to maximize her coin collection, fulfilling her goal.

The bandit now has both the coin taken from Tom and the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
