The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant at the crossroads. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine, which she can use to gain favor with the other bandits, she decides to rob the merchant.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit robs the merchant to take the medicine, which is a valuable item that contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible.
