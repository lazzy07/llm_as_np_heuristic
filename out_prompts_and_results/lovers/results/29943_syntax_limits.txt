To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade the item they have (I3) with Casey (C3) for the item Casey has (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, thus making them happy.

The action taken is:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. After this trade, Alex will have the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey will be happy because they have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake's happiness is not directly affected by this action.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they desire.
