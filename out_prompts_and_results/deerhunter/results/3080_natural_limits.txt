After Bubba shoots Bambi, he realizes he is still hungry and wants to eat. Since Bambi is now dead, Bubba decides to eat Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to remain alive. 

Now, Bubba has fulfilled his immediate need for food, but he still wants money. Since he has already shot Bambi, he can now go back to the bank to confront the clerk. However, since the goal is to end with Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (which is already the case), Bubba can simply stay in the forest and eat Bambi, achieving his goal of survival and satisfying his hunger.

The story ends with Bubba having eaten Bambi, which confirms that Bambi is dead, and Bubba remains alive, but he still has not acquired any money. However, since the requirement is to have Bubba with money or Bambi dead, the story meets the criteria with Bambi being dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
