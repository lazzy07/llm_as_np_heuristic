In this story, Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth. After eating both Vince and Talia, Gargax is left in the Village with no obstacles. The only item left to acquire is the treasure located in the Cave. 

To achieve his goal of wealth, Gargax will travel to the Cave and pick up the treasure. This action will satisfy his desire for wealth and ensure he is no longer hungry.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax picks up the treasure in the Cave, achieving his goal of wealth.
