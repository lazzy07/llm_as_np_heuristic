To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room B**: Since Jones is in the admissions room and has an unknown symptom, Hathaway should admit Jones to an exam room to assess their condition. This will increase Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room A to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to go back to the admissions room to assess Jones.

3. **Walk Hathaway from Admissions to Exam Room B**: After admitting Jones, Hathaway will need to assess Jones in Exam Room B.

4. **Assess Hathaway on Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. Since Jones's symptom is unknown, this action is crucial to identify the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Hathaway on Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, which will make Jones healthy.

6. **Assess Hathaway on Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in the admissions room, to determine their symptoms.

7. **Treat Hathaway on Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, making Young healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Jones and Young are treated correctly, achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
