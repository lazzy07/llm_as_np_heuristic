To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her current situation and the available actions. Talia is already married to Rory, which contributes to her happiness. She has also taken the money from Vince, which adds to her wealth. The only thing left for her to do is to acquire the treasure from the cave, which will further increase her wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia will travel to the cave to acquire the treasure. This action is necessary because the treasure is located in the cave, and Talia needs to be there to pick it up.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: After arriving at the cave, Talia will pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Talia to increase her wealth.

After these actions, Talia will have both the money and the treasure, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy. Since she is already married to Rory, her happiness is also secured.
