To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will increase Rory's happiness and wealth while ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to meet Gargax, who is wealthy and has the potential to help Rory achieve his goals.
2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is necessary because it allows Rory to become wealthy through the treasure he possesses, which Gargax will take after eating him. Although this action seems counterintuitive, it is the only way for Rory to achieve wealth in this scenario, as he cannot take the treasure with him if he is alive.
3. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action ensures that the treasure is now in Gargax's possession, but it also means that Rory's wealth is transferred to Gargax, fulfilling the requirement of wealth in the story.

After these actions, Rory is no longer alive, but he has achieved his goal of being wealthy (through the treasure), and he is not hungry (as he is dead). 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to go to the cave to interact with Gargax, who is the only character that can help him achieve wealth.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action is crucial as it allows Rory to become wealthy through the treasure he possesses. Although Rory dies, the goal of wealth is achieved.
- **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: This action ensures that the treasure is now with Gargax, confirming that Rory's goal of wealth is fulfilled.
