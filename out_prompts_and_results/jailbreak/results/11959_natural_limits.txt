Ernest, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that he has the knife, which gives him an opportunity to confront the bully. 

Ernest moves from the hallway to the gym, where he finds the bully. He uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Roy. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison with Roy.

This action is necessary because it directly addresses the immediate threat posed by the bully, allowing Ernest to achieve his goal of staying alive and ensuring he is not threatened anymore.

After killing the bully, Ernest can then return to the hallway, put on the civilian clothes, and escape to the highway, ensuring his survival.
