To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince needs to acquire the treasure, which will contribute to Rory's wealth when he gives it to Rory.

2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village to give the treasure to Rory, as Rory is currently at the cave.

3. **Rory takes the treasure from Vince.**  
   - This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, which will increase his wealth.

4. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - Since Rory now has the treasure, he can achieve happiness.

5. **Rory becomes not hungry.**  
   - Rory's hunger is addressed, ensuring he is not hungry.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Vince picks up the treasure to ensure Rory can become wealthy.
- Vince travels to the village to deliver the treasure to Rory.
- Rory takes the treasure from Vince, achieving wealth.
- Rory becomes happy because he has achieved his goal of wealth.
- Rory ensures he is not hungry.
