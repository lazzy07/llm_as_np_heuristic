To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is necessary to transition their relationship from enemies to friends. Since they are currently not fighting, they can establish a friendship, which aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

2. **The volcano erupts**: After making peace, the volcano will erupt, creating a dangerous situation. This action is crucial to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and leads to the next action.

3. **Zoe walks to the surface**: Zoe needs to be on the surface when the volcano erupts to fulfill the condition of a character dying. 

4. **The volcano finishes erupting**: This action will result in Zoe dying, as she is on the surface when the eruption occurs.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation.
3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe moves to the surface, where the eruption will affect her.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: The eruption finishes, resulting in Zoe's death.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **make_peace**: This action is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of making friends, which is a priority for both Zoe and the Lizard.
- **erupt**: This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of the volcano erupting, which is a key event in the story.
- **walk**: Zoe must be on the surface for the eruption to have an effect on her, leading to her death.
- **erupt**: This final eruption action results in Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
