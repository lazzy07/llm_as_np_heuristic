In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Market, where she can see both Tom and the Merchant. Tom is carrying the Medicine, which the Bandit cannot take since he is armed with a sword. However, the Bandit can take advantage of the chaos created by Tom's actions and the presence of the Guard.

To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit can rob the Merchant, who is unarmed, and take the coins that Tom had previously bought from her. This action allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins without directly confronting Tom, who is currently dead.

This single action is sufficient for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins, as it allows her to acquire the coins from the Merchant without any further conflict.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Bandit robs the Merchant because she is unarmed and vulnerable. This action is necessary for the Bandit to fulfill her goal of acquiring coins.
