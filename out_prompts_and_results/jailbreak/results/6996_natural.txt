**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take action to help his friend Ernest. He knows that Ernest is in the gym, threatened by the bully. 

1. **Roy moves to the gym.** (Roy wants to help Ernest and confront the bully.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to protect Ernest.)
3. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This is necessary for Roy to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
4. **Roy confronts the bully.** (Roy needs to ensure that the bully cannot harm Ernest.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action ensures that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now focus on escaping with Ernest.

6. **Roy helps Ernest out of the gym.** (Roy wants to ensure Ernest is safe.)
7. **Roy and Ernest crawl through the vents to the highway.** (This is the only way for them to escape without being caught.)
8. **Roy and Ernest put on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises them and allows them to blend in.)
9. **Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** (This fulfills their goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both he and Ernest survive and escape the prison. Locking the gym door prevents the bully from retaliating, while taking the knife allows Roy to confront the bully directly. Killing the bully removes the immediate threat, and crawling through the vents is a strategic move to avoid detection. Finally, putting on civilian clothes is essential for their escape.
