To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, and if he doesn't assess Ross, he won't know how to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Young, who is currently there. This is important because Young also needs to be treated to achieve Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young is also healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving the goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
