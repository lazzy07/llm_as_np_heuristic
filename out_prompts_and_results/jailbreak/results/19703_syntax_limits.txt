**Story Completion:**

On day two, Roy is in the gym with the bully, who is preoccupied with his workout. Roy knows he needs to escape the prison and avoid the bully's threats. He decides to take action.

1. **Action: kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)** - Roy seizes the opportunity to take revenge on the bully. He uses the knife he knows is in the kitchen to kill the bully, ensuring he is no longer a threat to him or Ernest. This action is crucial as it removes the immediate danger posed by the bully, allowing Roy to focus on his escape.

2. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Gym)** - After eliminating the bully, Roy quickly puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier. This disguise is essential for his escape plan, as it will help him blend in and avoid detection by the guards.

3. **Action: vent(Roy, Highway)** - With the disguise on, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is the final step in his escape, as it takes him out of the prison and into freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (killing the bully) is necessary to ensure Roy's safety and eliminate the threat that the bully poses. Without this action, Roy would remain in danger.
- The second action (disguising himself) is critical for Roy to successfully escape without being recognized by the guards.
- The third action (venting to the highway) is the culmination of Roy's plan to escape the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
