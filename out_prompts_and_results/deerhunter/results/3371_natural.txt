To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba becomes greedy.** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and becoming greedy will reinforce his desire to take the clerk's money.
   
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** This action is included to allow Bubba to leave the bank after stealing the money, as he may want to avoid confrontation with the clerk.

4. **Bubba decides to eat.** This action is included to show that Bubba is still hungry and may want to eat something, which could lead to a potential encounter with Bambi.

5. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** This action is included to allow Bubba to return to the bank, where he might encounter Bambi.

6. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** This action is included to fulfill the goal of Bambi being dead, as Bubba has the rifle loaded and can shoot Bambi.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. Bubba becomes greedy.
2. Bubba steals the money from the clerk.
3. Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.
4. Bubba decides to eat.
5. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.
6. Bubba shoots Bambi.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
