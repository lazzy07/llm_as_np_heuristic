**Story Completion:**

After walking to PatientRoomC, Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, he is able to accurately assess Ross without making a mistake. He finds that Ross has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, making Ross healthy.

Next, Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young, who is still waiting there. He finds that Young has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Young also becomes healthy.

With both Ross and Young treated successfully, Hathaway has achieved his goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
