To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **tell(C3, C2, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the flowers. This is a strategic move to ensure Blake knows what Alex wants, as Blake wants Alex to be happy.

2. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary for Blake to pick up the flowers.

3. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the flowers. This is essential for Blake to later give the flowers to Alex.

4. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary to give the flowers to Alex.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **tell(C3, C2, I1, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to understand what Alex wants, as Casey is trying to help both Alex and Blake.
