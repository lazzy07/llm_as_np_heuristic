**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Flaze, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Ross is already assigned to this room, and Hathaway believes he is alive. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Antibiotics, PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, which will make Ross healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions**: Hathaway then assesses Young in the Admissions room. Young is still unassigned, and Hathaway needs to check his symptoms to ensure he can be treated properly.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Steroids, Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, assuming he has Jarkis. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, which will make Young healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to assess Ross to identify his symptoms, which is crucial for determining the correct treatment.
- The second action treats Ross with the appropriate medication, ensuring he becomes healthy.
- The third action assesses Young to identify his symptoms, as he is still in the admissions room and needs to be treated.
- The fourth action treats Young with the correct medication, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
