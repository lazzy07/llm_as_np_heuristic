To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room. This is important to ensure that Young's condition is also evaluated, as he is another patient who needs treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is the first step in diagnosing and treating him.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated appropriately.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics/steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment results. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics/steroids, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment results. This ensures Young's recovery as well.

After these actions, both Ross and Young will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
