To complete the story, Bubba needs to achieve his goal of obtaining money. Since he is currently in the forest with a dead Bambi, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. After that, he can go to the bank to steal money from the bank clerk, who is still alive and has money. Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
