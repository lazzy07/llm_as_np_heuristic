As the day progresses, Roy realizes that the bully is a significant threat to both him and Ernest. He knows he needs to act quickly to ensure their safety. 

Roy decides to move from the laundry room to the hallway. Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from coming after them and gives Roy and Ernest a chance to escape.
