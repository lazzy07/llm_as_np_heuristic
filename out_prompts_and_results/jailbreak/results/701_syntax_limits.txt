**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Roy realizes that he needs to secure his safety and that of his friend Ernest. He knows the bully is a threat, especially since he has already threatened both of them. 

1. **Action: Go to the Hallway**  
   Roy decides to leave the kitchen and move to the hallway. This action is necessary for him to access the gym where the bully is located, as he needs to confront the bully to ensure their safety.

2. **Action: Lock the Gym**  
   Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door. This action prevents the bully from coming out and threatening him or Ernest, effectively neutralizing the immediate danger posed by the bully.

With the gym locked, Roy feels a sense of relief knowing that he has taken a step to protect himself and Ernest from the bully's threats.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Go to the Hallway:** This action is essential for Roy to transition from a safe area (the kitchen) to a strategic position (the hallway) where he can control access to the bully.
- **Lock the Gym:** By locking the gym, Roy ensures that the bully cannot threaten them anymore, thus achieving his goal of staying alive and not being threatened.
