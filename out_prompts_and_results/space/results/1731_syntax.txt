To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, which is essential for making friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, this action can succeed.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the surface. This action is taken to ensure that Zoe is not in the cave when the volcano erupts, maintaining her safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is included to show that the danger on the surface is real, but since Zoe is no longer in the cave, she remains safe.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard, achieving her goal of friendship, while also ensuring her safety from the erupting volcano.
