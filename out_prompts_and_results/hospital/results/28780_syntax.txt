To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young can be treated for their condition.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross again to confirm his symptoms. This is important because Ross has already been assigned to Exam Room A, and Hathaway needs to ensure that he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment as well.

6. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B so that he can be treated.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. This is essential for Jones's recovery.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
