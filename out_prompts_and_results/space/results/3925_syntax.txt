To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial because both characters want to be friends, and it will help improve their relationship, which is currently strained.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk to the Cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to find a safe place away from the dangerous surface, especially since the surface is currently dangerous.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the Cave. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe location, reinforcing their friendship.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard will begin the eruption of the volcano. This action is taken to create a diversion and to ensure that the surface remains dangerous, which will keep other potential threats away from the Lizard and Zoe.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, making the surface even more dangerous. This action solidifies the Lizard's safety by ensuring that no other creatures can approach them on the surface.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
