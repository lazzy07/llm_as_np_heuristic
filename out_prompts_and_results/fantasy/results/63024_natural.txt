To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to reach Talia and the treasure, which will help Rory achieve his goal of wealth.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - By picking up the treasure, Vince will increase his wealth, which is essential for Rory's goal since Rory is married to Talia and will benefit from Vince's wealth.

3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village with the treasure to ensure that Rory can access it.

4. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is crucial because it allows Gargax to take the treasure from Vince's dead body, which will then be available for Rory.

5. **Rory takes the treasure from Vince's dead body.**  
   - By taking the treasure, Rory will achieve wealth, which is one of his goals.

6. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure, Rory can now be happy, fulfilling his goal of happiness.

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, as he now possesses the treasure.
