To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba is at the forest.** (This is where he is currently located.)
2. **Bubba has 1 money.** (Bubba has already achieved his goal of having 1 money.)
3. **Bubba is hungry.** (This indicates that while he has achieved his monetary goal, he still has a need for food.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** (This action is taken to satisfy his hunger, but it does not affect his monetary goal.)
5. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (Since Bambi is not alive, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger.)

In this story, the actions taken are necessary to show that Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and also addresses his hunger. The story ends with Bubba satisfied with both his monetary and hunger needs.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat",
    "Bubba eats Bambi"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan reflects the actions taken by Bubba to ensure he is both financially and physically satisfied.
