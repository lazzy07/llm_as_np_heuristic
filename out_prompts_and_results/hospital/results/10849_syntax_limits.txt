To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they attempt to assess or treat more than one patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first assess one patient, then treat them based on the assessment.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway then assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

4. **Treat Ross with steroids**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy.
