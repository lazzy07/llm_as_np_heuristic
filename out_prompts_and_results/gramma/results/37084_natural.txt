To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary because the merchant has the medicine, and she needs to reach Tom to give him the medicine.

2. **The merchant gives the medicine to Tom.**  
   - This action allows Tom to obtain the medicine, which is his goal.

3. **The merchant walks back to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Tom's goal but helps to maintain the flow of the story and keeps the merchant in a location where she can continue her business.

4. **Tom walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to be in a location where he can interact with other characters if needed, but it is not essential for achieving his goal of having the medicine.

5. **Tom walks back to the cottage.**  
   - This final action ensures that Tom is back at the cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.

The story is concise and focuses on the necessary actions to achieve Tom's goal without unnecessary interactions or conflicts.
