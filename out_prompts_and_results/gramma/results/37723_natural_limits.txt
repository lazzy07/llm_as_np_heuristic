The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the chaos at the market. She knows that the guard is focused on the hero, who is now a criminal after robbing the merchant. The bandit walks back to the market from the crossroads, where she can confront the hero.

Once at the market, the bandit attacks the hero, who is unaware of the danger since he is preoccupied with the medicine he just acquired. The bandit successfully kills the hero, who is not armed with a sword, and loots the medicine from his corpse. 

Now, with the medicine in her possession, the bandit returns to her camp, where she can safely store her loot and enjoy her ill-gotten gains.
