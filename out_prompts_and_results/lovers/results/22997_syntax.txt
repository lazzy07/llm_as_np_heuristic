To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, we need to ensure that Casey receives the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Alex is already happy with the item they have (I1), the focus will be on making Casey happy.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Casey (C3) gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1). This action is included to ensure that Alex can also be happy by receiving the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After these actions, the happiness status will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Casey (C3) is happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
