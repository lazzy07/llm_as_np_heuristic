To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** The bandit is armed with two swords and can rob the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, increasing her coin count.
