To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe is currently in the cave, and the Lizard is on the surface. Since they are not fighting, Zoe can attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk to the cave to join Zoe. This action is necessary for them to be in the same location to solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once the Lizard arrives in the cave, they can further solidify their friendship. This action reinforces their bond and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After establishing a friendship, Zoe can teleport back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety from the erupting volcano on the surface.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, the Lizard can teleport to the spaceship as well, ensuring its safety and allowing both characters to be healthy and safe together.

This sequence of actions ensures that both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
