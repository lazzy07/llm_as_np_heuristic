To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank with one unit of money, and Bambi is also in the forest.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and get the money. This action is necessary because the clerk has the money that Bubba wants.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk, as he needs to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is the final step in achieving his goal of obtaining money.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, as he is hungry. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal of getting money, but it aligns with his current state of hunger.

5. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba goes back to the forest, where he can eat in peace. This action is not necessary for the goal of getting money but provides closure to the story.
