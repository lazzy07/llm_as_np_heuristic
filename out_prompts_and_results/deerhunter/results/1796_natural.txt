To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the bank clerk and obtain money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Going from the forest to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money from the clerk** is the action that directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully execute this action.

1. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.
2. Bubba steals the money from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.
