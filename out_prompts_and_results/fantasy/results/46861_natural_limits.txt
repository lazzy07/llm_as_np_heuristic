In the cave, Talia and Vince are married, but Talia's happiness is still at 0. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth. To achieve Talia's happiness, the following actions will take place:

1. Gargax eats Vince. This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eliminate a competitor for the treasure and is hungry. By eating Vince, Gargax will also take the money that Vince has, which will make Gargax wealthier but will leave Talia alone in the cave.

2. Talia picks up the treasure. This action is essential because it allows Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her goals. With the treasure in her possession, Talia's wealth will increase, and since she is married to Vince, her happiness will also increase.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy and happy, achieving her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her own goals without the presence of her husband, who is not contributing to her happiness.
- **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action directly contributes to Talia's wealth and happiness, fulfilling her desires.
