In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has item I3 (flowers) and is not happy, while Blake (C2) is happy with item I1 (jewelry). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Blake to give the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) is now happy because they have I1 (jewelry).
- Blake (C2) is still happy with I1 (jewelry) but has given it away, so they are no longer holding it.
- Casey (C3) remains unhappy as they still have I3 (flowers) and do not have what they want.

The story is complete as Alex has achieved their goal of happiness.
