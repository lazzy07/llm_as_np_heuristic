To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. Since both Jones and Ross are believed to have the same symptom (SymptomA), this will help Hathaway confirm the diagnosis.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. Since SymptomA is associated with Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics to Ross.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway will then walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is currently there.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to confirm his symptoms.

5. **Treat Jones**: After confirming Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. Since Jones also has SymptomA, Hathaway will administer antibiotics to him as well.

6. **Walk to Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room C to assess Young.

7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms.

8. **Treat Young**: If Young is found to have SymptomA, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
