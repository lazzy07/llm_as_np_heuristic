In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard, who is currently in a precarious situation on the surface. 

To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also ensuring that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a necessary action to fulfill the condition of the story where a character dies. Since the Lizard is on the surface, it will be affected by the eruption.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the eruption, Zoe will make peace with the Lizard. This action is necessary to ensure that despite the unfortunate event of the Lizard's death, Zoe and the Lizard's relationship is solidified as friends, as they had a mutual understanding and connection before the eruption.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The volcano erupts, causing the Lizard, who is on the surface, to die. This fulfills the condition of a character dying.
- Despite the tragic event, Zoe, who is in the cave, reflects on her interactions with the Lizard and realizes that they had formed a bond. She makes peace with the memory of the Lizard, solidifying their friendship in spirit.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of the story.
