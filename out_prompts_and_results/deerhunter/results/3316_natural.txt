To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba is at the forest and the clerk is at the bank, he needs to go to the bank to steal the money. This action is motivated by Bubba's greed for money.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

3. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and take the money.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their motivations:

- **Decide to steal:** Bubba wants money, so he decides to take it from the clerk.
- **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to steal the money.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money without resistance.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
