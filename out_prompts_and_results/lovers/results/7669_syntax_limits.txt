In this story, Alex is already happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey and Blake are not happy because they do not have the items they want (I2 - chocolates for Casey and I3 - flowers for Blake). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey and Blake happy, Alex can take a simple action.

**Action:**
1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R12)** - Alex trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey for the chocolates (I2) in the bedroom (R12).

**Explanation:**
- By trading the jewelry (I1) for the chocolates (I2), Alex helps Casey achieve their goal of happiness since Casey wanted chocolates. After this trade, Casey will be happy because they now have the item they wanted. Although Alex will no longer have the jewelry, they were already happy with it, and their goal was to ensure Casey's happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they achieved their goal of making Casey happy.
- Casey will be happy because they now have the chocolates they wanted.
- Blake will still be unhappy, but since Alex's goal was to make Casey happy, Alex has achieved their goal.
