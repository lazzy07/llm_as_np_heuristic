To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave where the treasure is located, and Vince has the money. Gargax is hungry and is at the cave as well. 

Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who is hungry and does not care about happiness, will eat Vince, who is at the cave. This action removes Vince from the story and allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger. 
   
2. **Talia picks up the treasure**: After Vince is eaten, Talia can now pick up the treasure that is at the cave. This action increases Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

3. **Talia becomes happy**: With the treasure in her possession, Talia feels a sense of accomplishment and happiness, fulfilling her desire to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary to remove Vince from the story, allowing Talia to access the treasure without interference.
- **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.
- **Talia becomes happy**: This is the result of Talia acquiring the treasure, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

The final outcome is that Talia becomes wealthy and happy.
