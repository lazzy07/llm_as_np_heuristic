To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is at the bank, where the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is hungry, and the clerk is not. Since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he will take actions to steal from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money from the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba decides to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger after having stolen the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba needs money, and the clerk has it. Using the rifle, he can successfully steal the money.
- **go**: Bubba needs to move to a safe location (the house) after committing the theft.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba is hungry and needs to eat something.
- **eat**: Bubba consumes Bambi, which he shot earlier, to satisfy his hunger.
