Zoe, the space explorer, is determined to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. To achieve this, she needs to ensure both of them are safe and healthy, especially with the volcano on the surface beginning to erupt.

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.

2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important as it allows her to approach the Lizard directly and engage with him.

3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

4. **Erupt (Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is in the cave with the Lizard, they are safe. This event adds urgency to their situation, emphasizing the need for cooperation and friendship.

5. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard realize they need to work together to ensure their safety. They solidify their friendship, achieving Zoe's goal of making friends.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully makes a friend in the Lizard while ensuring both of them remain safe from the erupting volcano.
