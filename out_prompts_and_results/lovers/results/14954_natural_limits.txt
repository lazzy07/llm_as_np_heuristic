In the living room, Alex sees that Casey has the flowers. Knowing that Alex wants the flowers, Alex decides to take action. 

**Action:** Alex moves to Casey and asks for the flowers.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary because Alex's goal is to be happy, which can only be achieved by obtaining the flowers from Casey. Since Casey is currently holding the flowers, this direct request is the simplest way for Alex to achieve their goal.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is not happy because they still want the jewelry.

However, the story's focus is on Alex achieving their goal.
