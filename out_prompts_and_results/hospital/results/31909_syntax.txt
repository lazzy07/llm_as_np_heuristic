To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Ross will walk from the admissions room to exam room B. This is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway will admit Ross to exam room B. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2, but it allows Hathaway to assess Ross.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway will assess Ross in exam room B. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which will inform the treatment.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, TreatmentA, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms assessed. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

5. **walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Jones will walk from the admissions room to exam room C. This is necessary to assign Jones to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him.

6. **admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway will admit Jones to exam room C. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it allows Hathaway to assess Jones.

7. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomB, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway will assess Jones in exam room C. This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which will inform the treatment.
