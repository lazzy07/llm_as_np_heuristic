**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, and he has the opportunity to get revenge. He quickly moves to the kitchen to grab the knife, knowing itâ€™s his only chance to eliminate the threat. 

With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway and crawls through the vents to the gym. Once inside, he confronts the bully. The bully, surprised and unable to defend himself, becomes a victim of Ernest's desperate need for survival. Ernest kills the bully, ensuring that he and Roy will no longer be threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping. He returns to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, and makes his way to the highway. Disguised and free, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and no longer being threatened.
