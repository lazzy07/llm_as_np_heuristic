In the cave, Talia and Rory are both alive, and Gargax is hungry. Since Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, he will take the opportunity to eat Rory, who is a human and at the same location. After Gargax eats Rory, Talia will be left alone with the treasure in the cave. 

Talia can then pick up the treasure, which will make her wealthy. Since Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy, this action will fulfill her desire for wealth, and she will feel a sense of happiness from achieving her goal.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Gargax eats Rory. (This action is necessary because it removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to be alone with the treasure.)
2. Talia picks up the treasure. (This action fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.)

Now, Talia is wealthy, and since she has achieved her goal, she is also happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is crucial as it eliminates one of the characters, allowing Talia to access the treasure without any competition or interference.
- **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action directly leads to Talia becoming wealthy, which is one of her primary goals.
