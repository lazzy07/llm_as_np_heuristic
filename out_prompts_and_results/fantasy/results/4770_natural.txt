To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to obtain the treasure that Rory has picked up. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry (hunger level 2) and needs to eat to reduce hunger. Eating Rory will also allow Gargax to take the treasure that Rory has, thus achieving wealth.
