In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy. The flowers are currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the flowers from Casey. 

Here's the action that will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Casey for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (the flowers) while giving Casey an item they may want (the jewelry).

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, and Casey will also be happy because they received the jewelry.
