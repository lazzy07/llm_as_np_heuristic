To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia has proposed to Rory, and they are both at the village. Since Talia's happiness is currently at 0, we can focus on actions that will lead to her happiness.

1. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: This action is necessary because it will make both Talia and Rory happy. Since Talia has already proposed, Rory's acceptance will fulfill the requirement for them to be happy.

2. **Talia and Rory get married**: This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that both characters are happy, which is Talia's goal.

3. **Talia picks up the money from Vince's body**: Since Vince is dead, Talia can take the money he had. This action will increase Talia's wealth, which is also one of her goals.

4. **Talia travels to the cave**: This action is necessary for Talia to access the treasure, which is another way to increase her wealth.

5. **Talia picks up the treasure from the cave**: This action will further increase Talia's wealth, ensuring she achieves her goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Rory accepts Talia's proposal (Talia becomes happy).
2. Talia and Rory get married (Talia remains happy).
3. Talia picks up the money from Vince's body (Talia becomes wealthy).
4. Talia travels to the cave (necessary to access the treasure).
5. Talia picks up the treasure from the cave (Talia becomes even wealthier).

By following these actions, Talia achieves her goals of happiness and wealth.
