**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Given that Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze due to the fever symptom associated with it.

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, even though they are currently unknown.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** (This action is taken to attempt to cure Ross, as Flaze is treated with antibiotics. The assumption is made that Ross has Flaze, despite the risk of misdiagnosis due to the high workload.)

After the treatment, Ross becomes healthy, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Ross**: This is crucial for Dr. Hathaway to understand what symptoms Ross is showing, even if they are unknown. It is a necessary step before treatment.
- **Treating Ross with antibiotics**: This is the treatment for Flaze. Even though there is a risk of misdiagnosis, the goal is to ensure Ross receives treatment that could potentially save his life.
