To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey moves to the dining room (R21 to R22)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as the jewelry, which is currently in the living room (R21).

2. **Blake picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21)**: Blake needs to pick up the jewelry to give it to Casey later.

3. **Blake moves to the living room (R21 to R22)**: Blake needs to move to the same room as Casey to give them the jewelry.

4. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (R22)**: This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

5. **Casey is now happy**: Since Casey has received the jewelry they wanted, they achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **Move (C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.
- **Pick up (C2, I3, R21)**: Blake needs to acquire the jewelry to give it to Casey.
- **Move (C2, R21, R22)**: Blake must be in the same room as Casey to give them the item.
- **Give (C2, I3, C3, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:
