Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads, aware that the bandit is nearby. The bandit, also at the crossroads, sees an opportunity to rob Tom. However, Tom, wanting to return to the cottage, decides to take action to ensure his safety and achieve his goal.

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence, which could lead to the bandit's capture or distraction, allowing Tom to safely leave the crossroads.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.** The guard, upon receiving the report from Tom, moves to the crossroads to confront the bandit. This action is necessary to ensure that the bandit is dealt with, allowing Tom to proceed without fear.

3. **The guard attacks the bandit.** The guard, armed with a sword, takes decisive action against the bandit, who is also armed. This confrontation is essential to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit, ensuring Tom's safety.

4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** With the bandit dealt with by the guard, Tom can now safely return to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there while carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage without any threat from the bandit, fulfilling his objective.
