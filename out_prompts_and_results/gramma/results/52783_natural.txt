The bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit already has coins in the chest, she can take actions to ensure she has more coins. The bandit will take the following actions:

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market. (This action is necessary for the bandit to access the merchant and potentially acquire more coins.)
2. The bandit robs the merchant. (The bandit is armed and the merchant is not armed, allowing the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant.)
3. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads. (This action is necessary for the bandit to return to the crossroads with the stolen medicine.)
4. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. (This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her camp with the stolen items.)

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying more items, specifically the medicine, and has ensured that she has coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the market**: The bandit needs to go to the market to interact with the merchant and potentially acquire more items.
- **Robbing the merchant**: This action allows the bandit to take the medicine, which is an item of value, and helps her achieve her goal of carrying more items.
- **Walking back to the crossroads**: This is necessary for the bandit to return to a central location before heading back to her camp.
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This final action ensures that the bandit is back at her preferred location with the stolen medicine.
