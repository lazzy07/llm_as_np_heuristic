Zoe, safe aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface is too dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She decides to teleport back to the surface to explore further, hoping to find a way to communicate with the Lizard. However, this action angers the Lizard, who sees Zoe's return as a threat to the safety of the planet.

The Lizard, feeling protective, walks from the cave to the surface to confront Zoe. Instead of fighting, the Lizard decides to make peace, understanding that Zoe's intentions may not be hostile.
