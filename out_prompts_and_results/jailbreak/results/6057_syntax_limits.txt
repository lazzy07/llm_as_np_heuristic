**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that the bully is in the gym with Roy, and both of them are threatened. To ensure his safety and that of his friend, he decides to take action. 

Ernest locks the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully and Roy inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening them further and gives them a chance to escape. 

With the gym door locked, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He can now safely make his way to the highway without the fear of being threatened by the bully. He heads to the highway, where he can finally escape from the prison.
