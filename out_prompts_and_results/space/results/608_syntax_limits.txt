Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the surface is now uninhabitable due to the erupting volcano. She knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is also in the cave with her. Despite their previous misunderstandings, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship that could benefit both of them.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goal of safety and health. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' desires to make friends and ensures they are not fighting, which is necessary for friendship to develop.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano erupts violently, causing chaos. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which is a significant event in the story.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Cave)**: Unfortunately, the eruption is so powerful that it causes the Lizard to be killed in the cave. This action is necessary to meet the condition of a character dying as a result of the eruption.

In the end, Zoe and the Lizard manage to make peace just before the eruption, but the Lizard tragically dies due to the volcanic activity. This outcome highlights the fragility of life and the importance of friendship, even if it is short-lived.
