To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the spaceship and return to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.
