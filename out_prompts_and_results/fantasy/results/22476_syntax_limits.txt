In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to acquire money and treasure. Given the current situation, Talia is already engaged to Rory, which contributes to her happiness. However, she still needs to become wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Talia achieve her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for her to access the treasure, which is essential for her wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to her wealth, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goal of being happy (due to her engagement with Rory) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).
