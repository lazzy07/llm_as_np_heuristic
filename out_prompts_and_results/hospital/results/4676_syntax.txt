To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment as well.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Young becomes healthy.
