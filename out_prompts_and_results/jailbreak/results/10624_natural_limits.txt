**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, still in the hallway, realized that the bully was a threat to both him and Ernest. He decided to take action. Knowing that the bully was in the gym and that he had the knife, Roy made a bold move. He locked the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully inside. 

With the gym door securely locked, Roy then put on the civilian clothes he had stolen from the laundry room, disguising himself. This disguise would allow him to escape unnoticed once he was ready. 

On the next day, with the gym door still locked and the bully trapped inside, Roy made his way to the highway. He felt a rush of adrenaline as he stepped outside the prison walls, finally free.
