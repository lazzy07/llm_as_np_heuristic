**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, realizing their workload is high, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room and assesses Young. Young shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes Young is healthy.
2. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway then assesses Ross, who also shows no symptoms, confirming he is healthy.
3. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Jones, who has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.
4. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze.

By assessing all patients, Hathaway ensures that both Ross and Young are confirmed healthy, and treats Jones correctly, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to confirm Young's health status, which helps reduce Hathaway's workload and ensures he is not mistakenly treated.
- **Assess Ross**: Similar to Young, assessing Ross confirms his health and reduces the workload.
- **Assess Jones**: This is crucial as it identifies Jones's condition (Flaze) so that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.
- **Treat Jones**: This action is essential to cure Jones of Flaze, ensuring he is healthy and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
