To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms observed. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what disease Young has so that he can be treated appropriately.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms observed. Similar to Ross, if Young has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze, and if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis. This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving the goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
