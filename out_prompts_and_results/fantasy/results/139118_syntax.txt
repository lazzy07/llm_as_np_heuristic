To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will help him secure wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pickup(Rory, Money, Vince)**: Rory takes the money from Vince. This action increases Rory's wealth, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, this action makes both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

At this point, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is wealthy (having taken the money), happy (after marrying Talia), and not hungry (as no character has become hungry).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Rory, Money, Vince)**: This action is necessary for Rory to increase his wealth, which is one of his primary goals. By taking the money from Vince, Rory ensures he has the financial resources he desires.
  
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action is crucial for Rory's happiness. Since Talia has already accepted his proposal, marrying her solidifies their relationship and brings happiness to both characters.
