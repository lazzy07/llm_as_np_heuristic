To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has received a marriage proposal from both Rory and Vince, we can have her accept one of these proposals, which will make her happy. Additionally, since Vince has money, marrying him will also make Talia wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **accept(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal. This action is necessary because it will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

2. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

3. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money from Vince. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she will now possess the money that Vince had.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage) and wealthy (due to acquiring the money).

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **accept(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Talia's happiness by accepting the proposal from Vince.
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action formalizes their relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness is achieved through marriage.
- **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: This action allows Talia to gain wealth, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.
