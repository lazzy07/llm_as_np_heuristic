**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Ernest is in a precarious situation, holding the pack of cigarettes that the bully wants. Meanwhile, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway, aware of the danger posed by the bully. 

To ensure their safety and achieve their goal of escaping, Roy decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that locking the gym door would prevent the bully from coming after them. 

Roy quickly moves to the gym and locks the door, effectively trapping the bully inside. This action not only secures their safety but also gives them the opportunity to escape without the threat of the bully looming over them.

With the gym door locked, Roy can now safely make his way to the highway. He moves through the hallway and then steps outside, where he puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Now disguised, he is ready to escape from the prison.
