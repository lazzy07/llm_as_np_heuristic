The bandit, armed with her sword and having just robbed the medicine from the merchant, sees the hero at the market. The bandit knows that the guard is also present and is a threat to her plans. To achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, she decides to take a calculated risk. 

The bandit approaches the hero and, using her sword, she attacks the hero. The hero, being armed but not expecting an attack, is caught off guard and is killed. The bandit then loots the hero's corpse, taking the merchant's sword and the hero's coin. With the hero dead, the bandit now has the medicine and the coins she desired.

This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she can now add the hero's coin to her own collection.
