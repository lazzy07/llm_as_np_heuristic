Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat them effectively. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - **Reason:** Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is currently in Admissions. This action reduces the workload by allowing Hathaway to interact with a patient directly.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - **Reason:** By assessing Jones, Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, this assessment is crucial to identify the correct treatment.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - **Reason:** After assessing Jones, Hathaway realizes that Young also needs to be treated. Admitting Young to Patient Room B allows Hathaway to manage the patients effectively.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - **Reason:** Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

After these actions, all patients are assessed and treated correctly, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
