1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room A.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will assume he has Flaze due to the fever symptom.)
