To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Talia currently has a treasure but is not happy. By being eaten, Talia will die, and since she is married to both Rory and Vince, they will inherit her treasure, which will make them wealthy. This aligns with Talia's goal of being wealthy, as her treasure will contribute to the wealth of her husbands.

2. **Rory and Vince take the treasure from Talia's body**: After Talia is eaten by Gargax, Rory and Vince can take the treasure from Talia's body. This action ensures that the treasure is transferred to them, making them wealthy.

3. **Rory and Vince become happy**: Since they have gained wealth from Talia's treasure, both Rory and Vince will achieve happiness through their newfound wealth.

This sequence of actions leads to Talia achieving her goal of being wealthy through the wealth of her husbands, even though she does not achieve happiness in the traditional sense.
