**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, still in the cells, decides to take a risk. He knows the bully is furious about the stolen cigarettes and is likely to retaliate. To protect himself and Ernest, he takes the cigarettes and sneaks through the vents to the gym, where he knows Ernest is currently locked in with the bully. 

Once in the gym, Roy finds Ernest and quickly hands him the knife he had hidden in his clothes. They both know that the only way to ensure their survival is to confront the bully. With the knife in hand, Ernest and Roy work together to overpower the bully. In a swift motion, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that they are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, they can now focus on escaping. They quickly search the gym and find the civilian clothes that Ernest had stolen earlier. They put on the clothes to disguise themselves.
