**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market. (The bandit wants to be at the market to potentially rob the merchant or take advantage of the situation.)
2. The bandit attacks the merchant. (The bandit is armed and can attack the merchant, who is not armed, to take the hero's coin.)
3. The bandit loots the merchant's corpse. (After defeating the merchant, the bandit can take the hero's coin from the merchant's body.)
4. The bandit walks back to the bandit camp. (The bandit prefers to be at the bandit camp with the coins.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Action 1:** The bandit moves to the market to confront the merchant, who has the hero's coin. This is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.
- **Action 2:** The bandit attacks the merchant because the merchant is unarmed and can be easily defeated. This action allows the bandit to take the coin without facing any resistance.
- **Action 3:** Looting the merchant's corpse is essential for the bandit to acquire the hero's coin, which is part of her goal to carry as many coins as possible.
- **Action 4:** Returning to the bandit camp allows the bandit to secure her coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
