To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Casey to potentially pursue their own happiness later.

4. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21). This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for a natural conclusion to the story.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it allows Casey to exit the scene, which can be important for narrative flow.
- **move(C1, R12, R21)**: This action allows Alex to return to the dining room, providing closure to the scene.
