To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory and the treasure in the cave. Since Talia is already married to Rory, their happiness is linked. Additionally, the treasure in the cave can help Talia achieve her goal of wealth. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve the desired ending:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary because it allows Rory to gain wealth, which can contribute to Talia's happiness and wealth indirectly.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with the treasure. This action is important as it allows Rory to take the treasure to a place where it can be used or stored.

3. **give(Rory, Treasure, Talia, Village)**: Rory gives the treasure to Talia. This action is crucial because it directly transfers wealth to Talia, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.

4. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Talia is not concerned about hunger, aligning with her character's traits.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory also becomes hungry. This action reflects Rory's character, who wants to avoid hunger but is willing to sacrifice for Talia's happiness.

6. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Vince is not focused on wealth, aligning with his character's traits.

7. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Gargax, despite being a dragon, is also affected by hunger.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, making her wealthy, and she is already happy due to her marriage to Rory. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

    "get_hungry(Talia)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "get_hungry(Vince)",
    "get_hungry(Gargax)"
  ]
}
```
