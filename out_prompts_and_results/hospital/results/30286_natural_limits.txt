Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize the patients in the admissions room. Since both Ross and Young are in the admissions room and are experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway needs to admit them to exam rooms to assess their conditions.

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to reduce Hathaway's workload and to ensure that Young receives attention. By admitting Young, Hathaway can later assess and treat them.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - Since Jones is already in Patient Room C, Hathaway can assess Jones's symptoms directly. This is crucial because it allows Hathaway to determine if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, and subsequently treat them accordingly.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway can treat Jones based on the assessment, ensuring that all patients are on the path to health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Admitting Young**: This reduces Hathaway's workload and allows for a systematic approach to patient care.
- **Assessing Jones**: This is essential to identify Jones's condition and provide the correct treatment, which is the ultimate goal of Hathaway.
