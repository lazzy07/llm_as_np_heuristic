To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Casey (C3) gives the item they have (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21)**. This action is necessary because Casey currently has chocolates (I1) and needs to give them to Alex to facilitate a trade for the jewelry. 

2. **Alex (C1) trades the item they now have (I1) for the jewelry (I3) with Casey (C3) in the living room (R21)**. This action allows Casey to receive the jewelry they want in exchange for the chocolates they just gave to Alex.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry, making them happy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Alex. This is necessary for Casey to facilitate the next action, which is a trade for the jewelry.
   
2. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R21)**: Alex trades the chocolates for the jewelry with Casey. This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.

Now, Casey is happy because they have the item they want (jewelry).
