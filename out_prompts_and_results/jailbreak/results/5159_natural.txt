**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, which gives him a chance to confront the bully.

1. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully directly and take control of the situation.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (Locking the door prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that they are alone, allowing Ernest to confront him without interference.)
3. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to be safe from the bully's violence.)

With the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison with Roy.

4. **Ernest goes to the hallway.** (This action is necessary to move towards the laundry room where the civilian clothes are located.)
5. **Ernest goes to the laundry room.** (He needs to get the civilian clothes to disguise himself for the escape.)
6. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguise is essential for avoiding detection while escaping.)
7. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows him to escape the prison without being seen by guards.)

Now, Ernest is on the highway, disguised and free.
