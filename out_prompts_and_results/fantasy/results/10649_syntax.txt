To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village to access the Money that Vince has. This is necessary because Rory needs to acquire wealth to fulfill their goal.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the Money from Vince. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory returns to the Cave to reunite with Talia and Gargax. This is important for Rory's happiness, as they are in a relationship with Talia.

4. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia. This action is included to create a scenario where Talia is no longer alive, which allows Rory to take the Treasure without any conflict.

5. **take(Rory, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Rory takes the Treasure from Gargax, who is now the only other character in the Cave. This is necessary for Rory to increase their wealth further.

6. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Rory is not currently satisfied, but it is not detrimental to their goal.

7. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory marries Talia, which makes them happy. This is crucial for Rory to achieve their happiness goal.

Now, Rory has achieved their goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring both Money and Treasure).
