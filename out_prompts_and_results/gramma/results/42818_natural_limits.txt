Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads with the merchant and the bandit. The bandit, also armed, poses a threat to Tom's safety. To ensure he can safely return to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take decisive action.

Tom attacks the bandit with the sword, successfully killing her. This action is necessary because it eliminates the immediate threat to Tom, allowing him to safely carry the medicine back to the cottage without fear of being robbed or attacked.

After the bandit is defeated, Tom loots the bandit's corpse, but since his goal is to return to the cottage with the medicine, he does not take any additional items. He then walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

The story is concise, with only two actions taken to ensure Tom's safety and success.
