1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to interact with Alex to get the item they want.

2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic lie because Casey actually wants the jewelry (I3). However, this action is necessary to create a situation where Alex might be willing to trade or give away the jewelry.

5. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) with the chocolates (I2). This is necessary to return to Casey and complete the transaction.

6. **give(C1, I2, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This is necessary for Casey to receive the item that they pretended to want.

7. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R12)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Alex for the jewelry (I3). This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
