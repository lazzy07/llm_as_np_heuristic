**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Flaze, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomA. Since Young is the only patient in this room, Hathaway can focus on them. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they might mistakenly believe Young has Jarkis, but they will still assess Young to determine the actual symptoms.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young, Hathaway decides to treat them with antibiotics, believing they have Flaze. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, and since Young is indeed suffering from Flaze, they will become healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in PatientRoomB. With a workload of 2, Hathaway is less likely to make a mistake. They will determine Jones's symptoms accurately.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats them with antibiotics. If Jones has Flaze, they will become healthy. If they have Jarkis, this treatment will not work, but since Hathaway is now more focused, they are likely to correctly identify Jones's condition.

5. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions. With a workload of 2, they can accurately determine Ross's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats them with steroids if they have Jarkis. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.
