Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, first admits Young to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of another patient. Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway can only guess, but with a workload of 2, there is no risk of a mistake. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, assuming he might have Flaze. This action reduces Hathaway's workload back to 1. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Young's symptoms are also unknown, but Hathaway treats Young with steroids, assuming he might have Jarkis. This action also reduces Hathaway's workload to 0. 

Finally, Hathaway checks on both patients. Ross, treated with antibiotics, is now healthy, and Young, treated with steroids, is also healthy. 

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully achieves the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
