To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomA to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because we need to know if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to treat them correctly.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, Hathaway will use antibiotics; if Jones has Jarkis, Hathaway will use steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to treat Jones based on the symptoms assessed.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Young based on the symptoms assessed.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
