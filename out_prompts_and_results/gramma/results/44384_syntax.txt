To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where Tom is located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to confront Tom to achieve her goal of obtaining coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of the coins he is carrying. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads. This is necessary to position herself for the next action.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit walks to the Market to confront Tom and rob him.
- The Bandit robs Tom to acquire his coins.
- The Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to prepare for the next action.
- The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp to ensure she has coins stored.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal effectively.
