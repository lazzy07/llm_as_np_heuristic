To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba wants to have money, this action allows him to achieve his goal directly.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the same location as the bank clerk to interact with him and take the money.
- **Picking up the money**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, which is the goal of the story.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk."
  ]
}
