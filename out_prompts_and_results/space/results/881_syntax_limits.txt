Zoe, aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface of the planet is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She decides to teleport back to the surface to find the Lizard and make peace, hoping to establish a friendship. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to confront the Lizard and attempt to build a friendship. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends.

By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to ensure their safety from the erupting volcano and establish a friendly relationship.
