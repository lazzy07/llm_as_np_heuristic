Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she looks at the Lizard, the guardian of this world. They have already made peace, but the danger of the surface looms over them. Zoe knows that to ensure both of their safety and to foster friendship, they need to find a safer place.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard has been. This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the dangers of the surface, which is currently unsafe.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe takes the opportunity to solidify their friendship with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it strengthens their bond and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship from the cave. This action is important because it allows her to leave the dangerous surface behind and ensures her safety while also keeping the Lizard safe by not being on the surface when the volcano erupts.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
