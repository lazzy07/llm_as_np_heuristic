To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to give or trade items.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the flowers (I1) with Blake in the dining room. This action is crucial because it allows Casey to give Blake the item they want, which is the flowers.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the bedroom. This action is necessary for Alex to receive the item they want.

5. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake moves back to the bedroom to be with Alex. This is important for the story's conclusion, as it brings all characters together.

6. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey also moves back to the bedroom to join Alex and Blake. This ensures that all characters are together, which is a happy ending for all.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
