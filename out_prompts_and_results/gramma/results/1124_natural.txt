To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The hero (Tom) walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to get closer to the merchant who has the medicine.

2. **The hero (Tom) walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

3. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant moves to the market to continue her business and avoid any potential conflict with the bandit.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit returns to her camp to regroup and possibly hide her coins.

5. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard moves to the crossroads to keep an eye on the situation and look for the bandit.

6. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is unnecessary since the guard is already aware of the bandit's location.

The essential actions for Tom to achieve his goal are the first two. The other actions are included to maintain the flow of the story and show the movement of other characters, but they do not directly impact Tom's goal.
