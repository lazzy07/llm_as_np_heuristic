To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions and the interactions with the other characters. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** (Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, and Rory is at the village.)
2. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's dead body.** (Gargax now has wealth, which is his goal.)
3. **Gargax travels to the cave.** (Gargax wants to be at the cave where the treasure is.)
4. **Gargax picks up the treasure at the cave.** (Gargax now has both the money and the treasure.)
5. **Gargax travels back to the village.** (Gargax wants to be back in the village.)
6. **Gargax eats Talia.** (Gargax is now not hungry and has achieved his goal of wealth.)

In this story, Talia does not achieve her goal of happiness and wealth because Gargax's actions directly lead to her demise. However, the focus was on Gargax achieving his goals, which ultimately led to Talia's failure.
