After Roy successfully crawls through the vents to the highway, he finds himself outside the prison. He is wearing the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, which allows him to blend in and avoid detection. 

Meanwhile, inside the gym, Ernest is still threatened by the bully. To protect himself and his friend, he decides to take action. He knows that the only way to ensure both of their safety is to eliminate the bully.
