**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, decides to admit Young to Patient Room C to ensure all patients are seen. This action increases her workload to 3, but she believes it is necessary to help all patients.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C to assess Young. Upon entering, she assesses Young and discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating Jarkis. However, due to her increased workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, the treatment for Flaze. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment for Young's actual condition, Jarkis, and as a result, Young dies.

After this, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to assess Ross. She finds that Ross is experiencing a fever, indicating Flaze. Since her workload has now decreased to 2 after treating Young, she correctly identifies the disease.

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Jones. She finds that Jones is experiencing a fever as well, indicating Flaze. With her workload back to 2, she correctly identifies the disease and treats Jones with antibiotics, making Jones healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated both Ross and Jones, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
