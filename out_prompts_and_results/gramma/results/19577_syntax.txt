To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying, increasing her total coins.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will return to the bandit camp to take the coins from the chest. This action allows the bandit to maximize her coin collection.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible through these actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to take the coin from Tom, who is not armed and cannot defend himself. This increases the bandit's coin count.
  
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action is essential for the bandit to retrieve the coins stored in the chest at the bandit camp, further increasing her total coins.
