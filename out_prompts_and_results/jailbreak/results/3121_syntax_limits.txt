After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the gym with the bully. Knowing that the bully is a threat, he decides to take action. He stealthily pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief and no longer feels threatened.
