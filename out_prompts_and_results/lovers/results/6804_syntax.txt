To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1 - flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room where Casey is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Casey and facilitate the exchange of items.
   
2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Casey in the dining room. This is crucial because Casey wants to make Blake happy, and by giving the flowers to Casey, Blake can help Alex achieve their goal indirectly.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to deliver the flowers to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the living room. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to give them the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers to Casey, who can then deliver them to Alex.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to Alex's location to complete the transfer of the flowers.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers they want, achieving their goal of happiness.
