To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room so that Hathaway can assess and treat him.
2. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room B to Exam Room C**: This action allows Hathaway to be in the same room as Ross, enabling the assessment and treatment process.
3. **Assess Hathaway on Ross in Exam Room C**: This action is crucial for Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms, which will inform the treatment decision.
4. **Treat Hathaway on Ross with steroids in Exam Room C**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication, ensuring he becomes healthy.

Now, let's assume Ross has a rash, which means he has Jarkis. This will allow Hathaway to treat him correctly.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Ross, ExamRoomC)**: This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him.
2. **Walk(Hathaway, ExamRoomB, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway needs to move to Exam Room C to be able to assess Ross.
3. **Assess(Hathaway, Ross, rash, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to confirm he has Jarkis, which is essential for the correct treatment.
4. **Treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

After these actions, all patients will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
