In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in a critical situation with three patients: Jones, Ross, and Young. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat them effectively. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess too many patients. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Hathaway achieving their goal:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but assessing one patient is manageable.

2. **Treat(Ross)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms observed. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Assess(Young)**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is crucial to determine Young's symptoms and provide the necessary treatment. 

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that at least Ross and Young are treated correctly, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess(Ross)**: This action is essential to identify Ross's condition and avoid misdiagnosis. 
- **Treat(Ross)**: This action is critical to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms, leading to his recovery.
- **Assess(Young)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and provide appropriate treatment, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
