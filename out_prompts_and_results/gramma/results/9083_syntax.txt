To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market and needs to move towards the Crossroads to eventually reach the Cottage. This action is necessary for him to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom will continue on to the Cottage. This action is essential as it brings him closer to his desired location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to leave the Market and head towards the Crossroads, which is a junction leading to the Cottage.
  
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to finally reach the Cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.

At this point, Tom is at the Cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.
