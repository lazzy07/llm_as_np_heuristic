To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated.

6. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.
