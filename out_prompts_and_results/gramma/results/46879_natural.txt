To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the hero.** The bandit is armed and can attack the hero, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to eliminate the hero and take the medicine, which is valuable for her plans.

2. **The bandit loots the medicine from the hero.** After defeating the hero, the bandit can take the medicine, which she can use to negotiate or trade for coins later.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may acquire.

4. **The bandit opens the chest at the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to access the coins she has stored in the chest, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of accumulating coins while eliminating the hero who poses a threat.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "The bandit attacks the hero.",
    "The bandit loots the medicine from the hero.",
    "The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.",
    "The bandit opens the chest at the bandit camp."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure the bandit can eliminate the hero, take the medicine, and access her coins, ultimately achieving her goal.
