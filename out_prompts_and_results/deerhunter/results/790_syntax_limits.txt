To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares Bubba to either threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi, depending on his next move.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action is taken to eliminate Bambi, which fulfills one of the conditions of the ending.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to consume the animal he has just killed.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to get money. This action is included to ensure that Bubba's greed is satisfied, as he has already expressed a desire for money.

After these actions, Bubba will have satisfied both conditions of the ending: he has killed Bambi and can potentially have the money from the bank clerk if he chooses to go back to the bank.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **load**: Prepares Bubba for a decisive action, either against Bambi or the bank clerk.
- **shoot**: Directly fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.
- **eat**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger and reinforces his survival instinct.
- **decide_to_get_money**: Aligns with Bubba's greed and desire for money, ensuring he is focused on his goal.
