To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Since Alex is currently in the living room (R22) and the jewelry is in the dining room (R21), Alex needs to move to the dining room to pick it up. 

Hereâ€™s the action that will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the living room to the dining room where the jewelry is located.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry in the dining room.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach the location where the jewelry is located. Without this movement, Alex cannot access the item they want.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This action allows Alex to acquire the jewelry, which is the item they desire to be happy.
