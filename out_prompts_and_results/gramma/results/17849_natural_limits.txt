Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit, who is also armed, and realizes that he needs to eliminate the threat to safely return to the cottage with the medicine. 

Tom decides to attack the bandit. Since the bandit is not carrying a sword, Tom successfully kills her. After the bandit falls, Tom loots her body and finds the coins she was carrying. With the bandit defeated and the coins in his possession, Tom can now safely return to the cottage.

This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, as it removes the immediate threat posed by the bandit.
