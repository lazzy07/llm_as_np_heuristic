Bubba is currently at the forest, hungry, and wants to have money. The goal is for Bubba to achieve his desire for money while ensuring that Bambi remains alive.

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. However, since Bambi is alive and Bubba's goal is to keep Bambi alive, this action will not be executed.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to get more money, as he currently has only 1 money and wants to have more.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having more money. Since he has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** - After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest, where he can feel safe and satisfied with his new wealth.

5. **Bubba decides to eat.** - Now that Bubba has achieved his goal of having more money, he can focus on satisfying his hunger. However, he will not eat Bambi, as he wants to keep her alive.

The final story is as follows:
- Bubba goes to the bank to steal money from the clerk.
- He successfully steals the money and returns to the forest.
- Bubba now has the money he wanted and can choose to eat something else, ensuring Bambi remains alive.
