To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had just bought. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the chest at the camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the Bandit Camp where she can store her coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to reach her preferred location where she can secure her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows the Bandit to gain a coin, which is essential for her goal of accumulating wealth.
- The second and third actions are movement actions that facilitate the Bandit's transition from the market to her camp, where she can safely store her loot.
- The final action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
