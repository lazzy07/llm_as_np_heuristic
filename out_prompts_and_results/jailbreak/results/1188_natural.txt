**Story Completion:**

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (Ernest needs to get closer to the gym where the bully is, as he is threatened and needs to find a way to protect himself and Roy.)
   
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Ernest to sneak into the gym without being seen by the bully, which is crucial for his safety.)

3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape and that he has a chance to confront him without the risk of being interrupted.)

4. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (Ernest needs a weapon to defend himself and Roy against the bully, who has threatened them.)

5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Ernest and Roy's safety.)

6. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (Disguising himself allows Ernest to escape without being recognized as a prisoner.)

7. **Ernest crawls back through the vents to the highway.** (This action takes him out of the prison and towards freedom.)

8. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (This final action fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to help Ernest eliminate the threat from the bully while ensuring his own survival and the ability to escape. Moving to the hallway and crawling through the vents allows him to avoid confrontation initially. Locking the gym door secures the environment for a decisive action against the bully. Retrieving the knife is essential for self-defense, and killing the bully removes the immediate danger. Finally, putting on civilian clothes and escaping through the vents allows Ernest to leave the prison undetected.
