Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano, decides to help her friend. She teleports from the ship to the surface to warn the Lizard about the imminent eruption. 

Upon arriving, Zoe sees the Lizard and quickly explains the situation, urging the Lizard to come with her to safety. The Lizard, grateful for Zoe's concern, agrees to leave the surface. They both walk together towards the cave, where they can find shelter from the eruption.

As they walk, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava and ash into the air. Zoe and the Lizard reach the cave just in time, but the eruption is so powerful that it causes a cave-in, trapping the Lizard inside. Zoe, horrified, tries to dig the Lizard out but is unable to save her in time. The Lizard dies in the cave.

Despite the tragic outcome, Zoe reflects on their friendship and the bond they formed during their brief time together. She vows to honor the Lizard's memory and continue her exploration with a newfound understanding of the importance of friendship and safety.
