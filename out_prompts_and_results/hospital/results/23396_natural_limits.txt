Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to take action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Jones, who is assigned to Exam Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A.** This action allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway will need to figure out if it is Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross, who is assigned to Exam Room B.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B.** This action allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room B to Exam Room C.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young, who is assigned to Exam Room C.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C.** This action allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms.

After assessing all three patients, Dr. Hathaway discovers that:

- Jones has a fever (Flaze).

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics in Exam Room A.** This action is necessary to cure Jones of Flaze.
