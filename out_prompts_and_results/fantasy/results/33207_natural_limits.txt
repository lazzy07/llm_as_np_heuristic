In the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but she is unhappy and has no wealth. To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who is hungry and wants to be wealthy, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it allows Gargax to gain the money that Vince has, which will make Gargax wealthy. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, Vince's death will not affect her marital status but will allow her to potentially gain wealth through the treasure.

2. **Talia travels to the cave**: After Vince is eaten, Talia will travel to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is essential for Talia to acquire the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, making her wealthy, and thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is crucial as it eliminates one character (Vince) and allows Gargax to gain the money, which is a step towards wealth for Gargax but indirectly benefits Talia by removing a character who has no direct benefit to her happiness or wealth.
- **Talia travels to the cave**: This action allows Talia to access the treasure, which directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.
