**Story Completion:**

After the U.S. Army takes the Ark from the Nazis, they realize the Ark is dangerous. To ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands again, the U.S. Army decides to secure the Ark in a safe location. Indiana Jones, still at Tanis, believes the Ark is still with the Nazis and is unaware of the current situation. 

The U.S. Army, now in possession of the Ark, fortifies their base and prepares to study the Ark's powers, ensuring that it remains safe and out of reach from any potential threats, including Indiana Jones, who they believe is still searching for it.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **U.S. Army takes the Ark from the Nazis**: This action is crucial as it ensures that the Ark is now in the hands of the U.S. Army, fulfilling the goal of having the Ark with them. The Nazis are already dead, so this action solidifies the U.S. Army's control over the Ark.

2. **U.S. Army secures the Ark**: This action is implied as necessary to prevent any future attempts to retrieve the Ark, ensuring that it remains with the U.S. Army and that the Nazis cannot return to claim it, as they are already dead.
