To complete the story and ensure that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage.
2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: From the crossroads, Tom can walk directly to the cottage, which is his desired location.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary because Tom needs to leave the market where he is currently located. He cannot go directly to the cottage from the market, so he must first go to the crossroads.
  
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom can finally walk to the cottage, which is his ultimate goal. This action allows him to arrive at the cottage carrying the medicine.

With these two actions, Tom successfully reaches the cottage, fulfilling his goal.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
