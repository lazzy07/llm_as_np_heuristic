To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the merchant, who has the medicine.

2. **Tom robs the merchant of the medicine.**  
   - Since Tom is armed and the merchant is not, he can take the medicine from her. This action allows Tom to acquire the medicine he desires.

3. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After acquiring the medicine, Tom needs to return to the crossroads to head back to the cottage.

4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This final action allows Tom to reach his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Tom first goes to the market to confront the merchant.
- He successfully robs the merchant of the medicine.
- He then returns to the crossroads and finally walks to the cottage.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom ends up at the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.
