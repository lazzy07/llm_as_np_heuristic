To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and wants to get to the Bank to obtain money. This action is necessary to move him to the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can steal the money from the Clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is crucial for Bubba to acquire the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can return to the Forest. This action is necessary for him to escape with the stolen money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi in the Forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the Clerk, which is his primary goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to escape with the money after committing the theft.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.
