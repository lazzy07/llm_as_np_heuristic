To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Alex that Casey wants the jewelry.** (This is a lie, but it will lead Alex to believe that Casey is not interested in the flowers, which may prompt Alex to act.)
2. **Alex moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Alex needs to get closer to Casey to obtain the flowers.)
3. **Alex moves from the living room to the dining room.** (This is necessary to reach the dining room where the chocolates are located, which Blake wants.)
4. **Alex picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (Alex now has the chocolates, which can be used to trade.)
5. **Alex moves from the dining room to the living room.** (Alex needs to return to the living room to interact with Casey.)
6. **Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the flowers.** (This is a lie, but it will make Casey think that Blake is not interested in the jewelry, which may lead to a trade.)
7. **Casey gives Alex the flowers.** (Casey, believing that Blake wants the flowers, is willing to give them to Alex.)
8. **Alex gives Casey the chocolates.** (This is a trade that satisfies both characters' desires, as Casey now has the chocolates that Blake wants.)

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, while Casey has the chocolates and is also happy. Blake remains unhappy because he does not have the jewelry, but the goal is to ensure Alex is happy.
