**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
3. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B and observes Unknown. (This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition, even though the symptoms are unknown.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and observes Unknown. (This action is necessary to determine Young's condition, even though the symptoms are unknown.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A for Jarkis using steroids. (This action is necessary because Jones is showing a rash, which indicates Jarkis, and treating him correctly will make him healthy.)
6. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B for Jarkis using steroids. (This action is necessary because Ross is also showing unknown symptoms, and since he is in the hospital, he should be treated as if he has Jarkis to ensure he becomes healthy.)
7. Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C for Jarkis using steroids. (This action is necessary for the same reason as Ross; Young should also be treated to ensure he becomes healthy.)
