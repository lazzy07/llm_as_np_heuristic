Tom, determined to get the medicine from the merchant and return to the cottage, quickly assesses the situation at the market. He notices that the bandit is armed and has just robbed him of his coin. However, he also sees that the merchant is armed and is in possession of the medicine he needs.

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it will draw the guard's attention to the bandit, who is a criminal. The guard, preferring to eliminate criminals, will likely take action against the bandit, allowing Tom to safely approach the merchant and acquire the medicine.

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is necessary for Tom to ensure the bandit is dealt with, as the guard will focus on the bandit and not on Tom.
2. **The guard attacks the bandit.** This action eliminates the threat posed by the bandit, allowing Tom to approach the merchant without fear of being robbed again.

With the bandit dealt with, Tom can now safely approach the merchant and acquire the medicine, fulfilling his goal of returning to the cottage with it.
