To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3), we can create a sequence of actions that leads to this outcome. Hereâ€™s the story:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with the other characters and potentially receive the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) they picked up earlier to Blake (C2). This action is important because it allows Blake to be happy, which aligns with Casey's desire for Blake to be happy.

3. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers (I1) they received from Casey for the chocolates (I3) that Alex wants. This action is crucial as it allows Alex to be happy, which in turn helps Casey feel fulfilled in their goal of making Blake happy.

4. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Casey. This is the final action that ensures Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
