Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting surface. They are not fighting, but they have no relationship yet. To achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends, they need to communicate and find common ground.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe needs to assess the situation on the surface and understand the threat of the volcano. This action is necessary for her to gather information about the erupting volcano and to demonstrate her willingness to confront danger.

2. **The surface erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of Zoe's action. The eruption poses a direct threat to Zoe, which may prompt the Lizard to act.

3. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to ensure her safety and to confront the danger together. This action shows the Lizard's protective nature and willingness to cooperate.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - In the face of the erupting volcano, Zoe and the Lizard realize they need to work together to survive. They put aside their differences and become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of making friends and being safe.

5. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - After making peace, Zoe teleports to the spaceship for safety, leaving the Lizard on the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her own safety.

6. **The surface erupts again, killing the Lizard.** - The eruption occurs after Zoe has left, resulting in the Lizard's demise. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also highlighting the consequences of the dangerous environment.

In summary, the story illustrates the journey of Zoe and the Lizard from being enemies to friends, culminating in the tragic loss of the Lizard due to the erupting volcano. The actions taken are necessary to achieve the goals of both characters while also leading to the required ending.
