To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness and hunger levels. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels from the cave to the village to be closer to Talia and Rory, who are both in the village. This is necessary for him to interact with them and potentially gain happiness.

2. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince marries Talia, who has accepted his proposal. This action makes both Vince and Talia happy, fulfilling Vince's goal of happiness.

3. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels back to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which is essential for him to become wealthy.

4. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the cave, which directly contributes to his wealth.

5. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry, which is a natural consequence of his actions and does not affect his goal of wealth.

By following these actions, Vince successfully marries Talia, gains the treasure, and achieves his goal of being wealthy and happy, even if he becomes hungry.
