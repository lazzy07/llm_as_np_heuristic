To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom at the Crossroads to take the medicine he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to confront Tom directly and take an item from him, which is a step towards increasing her wealth.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the stolen medicine and to be in a safe location where she can store her loot.

3. **Take BanditCoin from the Chest**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action is essential as it directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom to take the medicine.
2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to secure her loot.
3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial for the Bandit to gain an item (the medicine) that could potentially be valuable or useful in her dealings.
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This ensures that the Bandit is in a secure location where she can safely store her items and avoid confrontation with the Guard or Merchant.
- **Taking the BanditCoin**: This final action fulfills the Bandit's goal of accumulating wealth, as it allows her to carry more coins.
