To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba leaves the bank after stealing the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk:** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has it.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money.
- **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest:** This action is included to show that Bubba is leaving the bank after successfully stealing the money, but it is not necessary for achieving the goal since the goal is already met.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
