In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (chocolates), and Blake currently has item I3. To achieve their goal, Blake can give the chocolates to Alex, making both of them happy.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they receive the item they want (I3). Since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, this action fulfills that goal as well.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex is happy because they have I3)
- happy(C2) = True (Blake is happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy)
- happy(C3) = False (Casey remains unhappy, but this does not affect Blake's goal)

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["give(C2, I3, C1, R22)"]
