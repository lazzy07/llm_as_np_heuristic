To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him feel better and may also give him a sense of accomplishment.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially take the money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi and has successfully stolen the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Going to the bank**: This action is required for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
