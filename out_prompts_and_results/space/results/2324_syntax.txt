To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Here’s how we can achieve that:

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** This action is necessary because the volcano is on the Surface, and Zoe needs to be there for the eruption to affect her. 
   
2. **The volcano begins to erupt.** This action is crucial as it initiates the eruption process, which will lead to the danger on the Surface.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is important because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **The volcano erupts.** This action will result in the death of Zoe, as she is on the Surface when the eruption occurs.

Now, let's outline the actions taken in the story:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)** - Zoe moves to the Surface where the volcano is located.
2. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - The volcano starts to erupt, creating a dangerous situation.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Zoe and the Lizard become friends, achieving their goal of friendship.
4. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, leading to Zoe's death.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying (Zoe), and both characters making friends.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "begin_erupt(Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively meets the requirements of the story while adhering to the constraints provided.
