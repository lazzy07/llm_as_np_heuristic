Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety and establish a friendship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it allows them to stop any potential conflict and start building a relationship. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they explore the cave together, which is a safer location. This action helps them to move to a safer environment while continuing to bond.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, further solidifying their friendship and ensuring both characters are in a safe place.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe reaffirms their friendship with the Lizard. This action is important as it strengthens their bond and ensures that they both feel safe and healthy in each other's company.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making a friend in the Lizard.
