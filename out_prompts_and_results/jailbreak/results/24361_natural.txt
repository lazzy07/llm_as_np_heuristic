**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, still in the kitchen, realizes he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym, and the gym door is locked, which gives him a moment of respite. 

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action allows Roy to get closer to the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
3. **Roy takes out the knife.** (This action prepares Roy for a confrontation with the bully.)
4. **Roy unlocks the gym door.** (This action allows him to confront the bully directly.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to Ernest in the cell block without fear of being threatened. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Moving to the hallway**: This is necessary for Roy to access the gym without being seen.
- **Crawling through the vents**: This allows Roy to bypass the locked door and surprise the bully.
- **Taking out the knife**: Essential for the confrontation, as it gives Roy the means to defend himself and eliminate the threat.
- **Unlocking the gym door**: This is crucial for Roy to confront the bully directly.
- **Killing the bully**: This action ensures that both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened, allowing them to live without fear.
