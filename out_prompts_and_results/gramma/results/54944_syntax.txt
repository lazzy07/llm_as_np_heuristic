1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to her camp to secure the coins she has in the chest. This is necessary for her to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at her camp. This action ensures that she has the coins she desires.

The Bandit’s goal is to have coins in her possession or in her camp, and by taking the coins from the chest, she fulfills this requirement.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit retrieves the coins from the chest in her camp. This action directly fulfills her goal of having coins.
