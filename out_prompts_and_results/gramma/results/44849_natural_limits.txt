The bandit, armed with both the bandit's sword and the merchant's sword, stands at the market after successfully attacking the guard and the merchant. With the merchant dead, the bandit now has access to the medicine and the hero's coin. The bandit decides to walk back to the bandit camp, carrying the medicine and the coin she took from the merchant. 

This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. By walking back to the bandit camp, she ensures that she can store her loot safely and fulfill her objective.
