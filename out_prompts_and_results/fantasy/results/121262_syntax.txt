To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her current situation and the available actions. Talia is currently in the Cave, married to Vince, and has some money. However, she is not happy yet. The treasure is also in the Cave, which can help her become wealthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness or wealth:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary because acquiring the treasure will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the Village. This action is necessary to return to a location where she can interact with Vince and potentially improve her happiness.

3. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Although Talia is already married to Vince, this action can be interpreted as a reaffirmation of their bond, which can contribute to her happiness. However, since they are already married, this action may not be strictly necessary but can symbolize their commitment.

4. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry. This action is included to create a scenario where Talia might seek food, which can lead to interactions that could increase her happiness.

5. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village, where he can interact with Talia and Vince. This action is included to bring Rory into the Village, where he can help Talia.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory in the Cave. This action is included to remove Rory from the story, which simplifies the narrative and allows Talia to focus on her own goals without interference.

7. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels to the Village. This action is included to bring Gargax into the Village, where he can interact with Talia.

8. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax eats Talia in the Village. This action is included to conclude the story, as it removes Talia from the narrative, but since she has already picked up the treasure, she has achieved her goal of becoming wealthy.

In summary, the actions taken lead to Talia picking up the treasure, which fulfills her desire to be wealthy. The subsequent actions create a scenario where Talia's happiness is not directly achieved, but her wealth is secured through the treasure.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)",
    "travel(Talia, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Vince, Talia, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Talia)",
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)",
    "travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)",
    "eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia becomes wealthy through the treasure she picks up, even though her happiness is not directly achieved due to the actions of Gargax.
