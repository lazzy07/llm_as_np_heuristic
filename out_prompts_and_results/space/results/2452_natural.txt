Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially help the Lizard. She knows that the Lizard is at the surface and is not safe, so she teleports back to the surface to confront the Lizard.

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and assess the situation on the surface, where the volcano is erupting.)

Upon arriving at the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard struggling with the eruptions. Instead of attacking, she decides to communicate and make peace.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, aligning with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and ensuring safety.)

As they begin to understand each other, the volcano erupts violently, causing chaos around them.

3. **The volcano erupts.** (This event is necessary to fulfill the condition of the story where the volcano erupts, leading to a character's demise.)

In the chaos, the Lizard, despite their newfound friendship, is unable to escape the eruption in time and is tragically killed.

4. **The Lizard dies.** (This action concludes the story with a character dying due to the eruption, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.)

In summary, the actions taken were essential for Zoe to reach the Lizard, establish a friendship, and ultimately lead to the eruption that resulted in the Lizard's death.
