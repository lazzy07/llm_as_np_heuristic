To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary for Alex to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R22). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) to be closer to Alex. This action is included to show the interaction between characters.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the living room (R21) as well. This action is included to show that all characters are now in the same room.

6. **tell(C2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the flowers (I1). This action is included to create a sense of awareness among the characters about each other's desires.

7. **give(C1, I1, C1, R21)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to themselves, which is a redundant action but emphasizes that Alex has obtained what they want. 

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
