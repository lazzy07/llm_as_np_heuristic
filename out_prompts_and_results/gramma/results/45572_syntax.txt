To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot Tom's coin since Tom is dead and the Bandit is armed. This action allows the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins secured in her camp.

The Banditâ€™s goal is achieved by first looting Tom's coin and then taking the coins from the chest, maximizing her coin count.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting Tom's Coin**: Since Tom is dead, the Bandit can loot his coin without any repercussions. This action directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of carrying more coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action secures the Bandit's coins in her camp, ensuring she has a stash of coins, which is part of her goal.
