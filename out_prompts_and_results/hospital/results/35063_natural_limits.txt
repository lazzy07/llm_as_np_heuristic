Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing and treating the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is in Patient Room B, assessing them will help Hathaway understand if they have Flaze or Jarkis. 

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats them with antibiotics. This action is crucial for achieving the goal of making Young healthy. 

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can later assess and treat Jones, ensuring that all patients are on the path to health. 

After these actions, Young is healthy, and Jones is now in an exam room, ready for assessment and treatment, which aligns with Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
