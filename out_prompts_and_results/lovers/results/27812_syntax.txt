To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I3) they have with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will not be happy, but this does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want in exchange for the flowers they have. This is the only action needed to ensure Alex's happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
