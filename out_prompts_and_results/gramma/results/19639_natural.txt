To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit will rob the merchant of the hero's coin. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count without needing to return to the bandit camp.
2. The bandit will then walk back to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the bandit to secure the coins in the chest at the camp.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant of the hero's coin.** 
   - This action is taken because the bandit needs to acquire more coins. The merchant is not armed, making her an easy target for robbery. By taking the hero's coin from the merchant, the bandit increases her wealth.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**
   - After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit needs to secure her coins. Walking to the bandit camp allows her to store the coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

At this point, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
