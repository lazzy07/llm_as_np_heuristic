To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia will travel back to the Village where Rory and Vince are located. This is necessary because she needs to interact with them to achieve her goals.

2. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Once Talia arrives in the Village, she will pick up the Money that Vince has. This is essential for her to become wealthy.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia is already married to Rory, so this action reaffirms their relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness remains intact.

4. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory will travel to the Cave to be with Talia. This is important for maintaining their relationship and Talia's happiness.

5. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia will take the Money from Vince, which will make her wealthy. This action is crucial for her goal of wealth.

6. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince will become hungry, which is a necessary action to create a situation where he might need to rely on Talia or Rory for help, thus reinforcing their relationship dynamics.

7. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax will eat Vince, which will remove him from the story and eliminate any potential competition for Talia's affections or wealth. This action is necessary to ensure Talia's goals are met without interference.

After these actions, Talia will be happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (after acquiring the Money), thus achieving her goals.
