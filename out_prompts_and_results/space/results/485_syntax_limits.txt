Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is also present. She understands that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and wants to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface is erupting, and she knows they need to act quickly. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and extend a hand of friendship. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. By making peace, they can avoid conflict and work together.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting. 

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, being on the surface when the volcano erupts, unfortunately, meets its demise. This action concludes the story with a character dying, which is one of the specified endings.

In summary, the actions taken are aimed at fostering friendship between Zoe and the Lizard while also fulfilling the requirement of the volcano erupting and resulting in the Lizard's death.
