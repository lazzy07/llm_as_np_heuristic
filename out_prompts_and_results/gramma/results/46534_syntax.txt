To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the TomCoin that Tom has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the Camp, which is her ultimate goal.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then retreats to the safety of her camp with the stolen coin.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire the TomCoin, which directly contributes to her goal of having more coins.
- **Walking to Camp**: This action ensures that the Bandit can store her coins safely in the chest at the Camp, fulfilling her objective of maximizing her coin count.
