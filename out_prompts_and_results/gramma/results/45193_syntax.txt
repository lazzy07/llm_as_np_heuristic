To complete the story, we need to ensure that Tom successfully gets to the cottage carrying the medicine. Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve this goal:

1. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom uses the coin he just acquired from the bandit to buy the medicine from the merchant. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal of being at the cottage carrying it.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom walks from the market to the crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards his ultimate destination, the cottage.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action completes his journey to the cottage, where he will be carrying the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **buy**: Tom needs the medicine to achieve his goal, and he uses the coin he obtained from the bandit to purchase it from the merchant.
- **walk**: Tom needs to move from the market to the crossroads and then from the crossroads to the cottage to reach his destination.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine in the shortest possible way.
