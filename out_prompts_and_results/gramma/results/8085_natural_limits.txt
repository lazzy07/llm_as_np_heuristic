The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the crossroads to the market. There, she sees the guard and the hero. The bandit decides to rob the hero, who is carrying the merchant's sword but is not armed. The bandit successfully takes the sword from the hero, leaving the hero defenseless. With the hero now vulnerable, the bandit can easily return to the bandit camp with the stolen sword and her coins, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where she can interact with the hero and the guard.
2. **Bandit robs the hero**: The bandit takes advantage of the hero's defenselessness to steal the sword, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying more items (coins and now a sword).

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
