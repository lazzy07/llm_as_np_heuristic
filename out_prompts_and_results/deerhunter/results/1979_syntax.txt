To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to steal from the bank clerk. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to intimidate the clerk into giving up the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to acquire the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and head back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once in the forest, Bubba decides he is still hungry and wants to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank to find Bambi, the deer, which he can eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to find food.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to shoot Bambi, which allows him to obtain food. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his hunger.

6. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of eating.
