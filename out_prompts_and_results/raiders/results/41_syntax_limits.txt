In this story, the Nazis have already opened the Ark of the Covenant, which has granted them immortality. Their goal is to ensure they can use this newfound power to dominate and control. Since the US Army is currently in the USA and unaware of the Ark's current status, the Nazis decide to take action to solidify their position.

The Nazis, now immortal, will travel to the USA to confront the US Army and assert their dominance. They believe that their immortality gives them an advantage over the US Army, which is still armed but unaware of the Nazis' new power.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis travel from Tanis to the USA to confront the US Army and assert their dominance.

This action is necessary because it allows the Nazis to reach the US Army and leverage their immortality against them, ensuring they can achieve their goal of control.
