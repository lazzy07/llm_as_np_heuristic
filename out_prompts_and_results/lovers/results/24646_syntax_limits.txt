In the current situation, Casey (C3) is in the living room (R12) and wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I3), which is currently with Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). To achieve this, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Move from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22)**: This action allows Casey to reach Alex, who has the jewelry that Casey wants.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:

- Casey is now in the dining room (R22) with Alex.
- Casey can then ask Alex for the jewelry, which will make Casey happy.

This single action is necessary for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["move(C3, R12, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Casey achieving their goal with the minimum number of actions.
