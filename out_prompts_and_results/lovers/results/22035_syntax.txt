To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can see that Casey is not happy and wants the jewelry, which is currently with Alex (C1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex has the jewelry. This is a truthful statement since Alex does have the jewelry (I1).
2. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (the living room).
3. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I3, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to know where to find the jewelry. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, they will provide truthful information to help Casey achieve their goal.
   
2. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to move to the living room to be able to interact with Alex and receive the jewelry. This movement is essential for the next action to take place.

3. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: This action is the culmination of the previous steps. By giving the jewelry to Casey, Alex ensures that Casey is happy, fulfilling their desire.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
