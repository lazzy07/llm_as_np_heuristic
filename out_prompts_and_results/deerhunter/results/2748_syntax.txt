1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money rather than earning it through legitimate means.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba, now having the money but still hungry, will decide to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after the stressful events.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank to check if the clerk is still there. This action is necessary to ensure that he can confirm his success in stealing the money.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If the clerk is still present, Bubba will shoot him to eliminate any witnesses to his crime. This action is necessary to secure his escape and ensure that no one can report him.

6. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer, in the forest. This action is necessary to satisfy his hunger and utilize the resources available in the forest.

The story concludes with Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money and satisfying his hunger.
