In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but currently, they are not happy. Casey (C3) has the jewelry and is happy, while Blake (C2) is not happy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are in the bathroom (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Blake to give the chocolates to Alex. This would make Alex happy, as they would then have the item they want.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(Blake, I2, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates and will be happy.
- Blake will be unhappy because they no longer have the chocolates.
- Casey will remain happy with the jewelry.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
