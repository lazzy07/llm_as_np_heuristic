To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (the living room). This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to achieve their goal.

2. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to make Casey happy, as Casey wants the jewelry.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room to be with Alex and Casey. This is important for Blake to be part of the resolution and to ensure that everyone is together.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it helps Blake achieve their goal of making Alex happy.

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but helps to keep the characters engaged in the story.

6. **put_down(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey puts down the flowers (I3) in the dining room. This action is not necessary for achieving Alex's goal but adds to the narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the chocolates from Blake, and Casey will also be happy because they have received the jewelry from Alex.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "give(C1, I1, C3, R12)",
    "move(C2, R22, R12)",
    "give(C2, I2, C1, R12)",
    "move(C3, R12, R22)",
    "put_down(C3, I3, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to give them the jewelry.
