**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to help Ernest and ensure their safety. He decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards while he plans his next move.

Next, Roy sneaks back through the vent to the gym. Since the gym door is locked, he can safely confront the bully without the risk of being interrupted by guards. Once inside, he finds the bully, who is unaware of Roy's presence. Roy then takes the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously planned to retrieve. With the knife in hand, he confronts the bully and kills him, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy returns to the hallway and makes his way back to the highway. Now, with the threat eliminated, he can safely escape from the prison while wearing the civilian clothes. This final action is essential as it fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.
