To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action will initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are currently not fighting, this action allows them to become friends. This is crucial for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures, including the Lizard.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action will finalize the eruption of the volcano, which will lead to the death of one of the characters. Since Zoe is currently in the cave with the Lizard, she will be safe, but the Lizard will be on the surface when the eruption occurs.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: This action represents the Lizard's death due to the eruption of the volcano. It is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying as a result of the eruption.

The sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Completes the eruption, leading to the consequences of the earlier action.
- **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: Represents the Lizard's death due to the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
