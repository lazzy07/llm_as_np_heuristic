The bandit, having just attacked the merchant, realizes that the merchant is dead and that she can now loot the merchant's body. The bandit walks from the market to the merchant's corpse, loots the medicine, and then returns to the bandit camp with the medicine in hand. 

This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. By looting the medicine, the bandit not only secures a valuable item but also ensures that she has something to show for her criminal activities, which aligns with her goal of accumulating wealth.
