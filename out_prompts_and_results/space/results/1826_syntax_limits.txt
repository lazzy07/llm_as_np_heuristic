Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, and they need to act quickly. 

Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship to assess the situation and find a way to help the Lizard. However, this action makes the Lizard angry because it feels abandoned. The Lizard, feeling threatened by the eruption and Zoe's sudden departure, decides to attack Zoe in a moment of panic.
