In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (the jewelry) to be happy, and they believe it is with Casey (C3). However, Casey is currently in the same room as Alex (R21) and has item I3 (the chocolates), which Alex does not want. 

To achieve their goal, Alex can simply tell Casey that they want the chocolates (I2), which is a lie, but it will prompt Casey to give Alex the jewelry (I1) since Casey wants to make Alex happy. 

Here’s the action sequence:

1. **tell(C1, C3, I2, R21)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the chocolates. This action is necessary because it misleads Casey into thinking that by giving Alex the chocolates, they will make Alex happy, which is what Casey wants to do.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey, believing Alex's statement, gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the item they want (I1), and Casey will also feel satisfied because they believe they have made Alex happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C1, C3, I2, R21)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This story is concise and effectively leads to Alex achieving their goal of happiness with the minimum necessary actions.
