Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway's assessment will help determine the correct treatment. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, discovering that he has a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify the correct disease and treatment for Jones.

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: After identifying that Jones has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room C, preparing to assess him next. This action is important as it keeps the workflow moving and allows Hathaway to continue working towards the health of all patients.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring he is healthy, and sets up for the next patient, Ross.
