To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to move to a location where she can interact with the bandit, who has coins in her chest.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - The bandit needs to go to the cottage to retrieve her coins from the chest, which is essential for her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **The merchant waits at the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to remain in a position to interact with the bandit once she arrives.

4. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest.**  
   - The bandit retrieves her coins, which she will then carry back to the crossroads.

5. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit returns to the crossroads with her coins, making them available for potential interaction with the merchant.

6. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant ensures that the guard will come to the crossroads, which will create a distraction.

7. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard arrives at the crossroads, ready to confront the bandit.

8. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit, allowing the merchant to loot the coins from the bandit's corpse without becoming a criminal.

9. **The merchant loots the coins from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - The merchant collects the coins, achieving her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions ensures that the merchant successfully acquires coins while adhering to her moral code, as she does not directly steal or kill.
