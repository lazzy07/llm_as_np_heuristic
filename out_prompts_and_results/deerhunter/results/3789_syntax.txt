To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he should also go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where he can steal money from the clerk.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is implicit in the previous actions, as Bubba's greed drives him to steal money from the clerk.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can steal money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Acquires money from the clerk, fulfilling Bubba's greedy desire.
