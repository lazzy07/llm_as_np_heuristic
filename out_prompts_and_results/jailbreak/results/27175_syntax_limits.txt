**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Roy realizes he has the upper hand against the bully. He knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest, and he cannot let that continue. With the knife he stole from the kitchen, Roy decides to take action. He approaches the bully, who is trapped inside the gym with him, and uses the knife to kill the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief. He can now focus on escaping the prison with Ernest. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**: Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping and to ensure he can confront him without interference.
2. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat to both himself and Ernest.

This sequence of actions allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and no longer threatened, while also ensuring that he can help Ernest escape later.
