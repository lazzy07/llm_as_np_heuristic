To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Young, who is currently there. This is important because Young also needs to be evaluated for symptoms to receive appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated.

6. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
