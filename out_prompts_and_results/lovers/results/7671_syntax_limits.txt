In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is unhappy because they want item I3 (the flowers), which is with Casey. Casey is happy because they have the jewelry (I1) that they want. 

To achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey for the flowers (I3). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the flowers, thus making Alex happy.

After the trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I3) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will still be happy because they have what they want (the jewelry).
- Blake will have the flowers (I3) and will be happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the action:

1. **trade(Blake, I2, Casey, I3, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates for the flowers with Casey in the dining room.

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.
