In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but Talia is still unhappy and poor. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth. To achieve her goal of happiness, Talia needs to acquire the treasure that is located in the cave. 

Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Rory, who is at the cave with Talia. This action will not only satisfy Gargax's hunger but also leave Talia alone in the cave with the treasure. After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can then pick up the treasure, which will make her wealthy and ultimately happy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Gargax eats Rory. (This action removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to be alone with the treasure.)
2. Talia picks up the treasure. (This action gives Talia the wealth she desires, making her happy.)

By following this sequence, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy and happy.
