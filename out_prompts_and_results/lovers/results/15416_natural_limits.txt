In the living room, Casey holds the flowers and wants the jewelry. Alex, who has the jewelry, wants the flowers. Blake, who is also in the living room, wants the chocolates that are in the dining room. 

To achieve their goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.** This action is necessary because it allows Alex to become happy by receiving the flowers they want. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still unhappy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry after Alex gives it to them.

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry.
