**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.
2. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the story requires Ross to achieve his goal of being healthy. The assessment is crucial to identify if Ross has Jarkis (rash) or Flaze (fever).

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids.**  
   Assuming that Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition as Jarkis (despite the risk of confusion due to workload), this treatment is essential for Ross to become healthy. If treated correctly, Ross will recover, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
