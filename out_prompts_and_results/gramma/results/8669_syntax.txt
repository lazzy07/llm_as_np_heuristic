To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to navigate the current situation effectively. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action takes him directly to his desired location.

After this action, Tom is at the Cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because it allows Tom to move from the Crossroads, where he currently is, to the Cottage, which is his desired location. Since he is already carrying the medicine, this action directly leads him to achieve his goal.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the most efficient way for Tom to achieve his goal without unnecessary actions or complications.
