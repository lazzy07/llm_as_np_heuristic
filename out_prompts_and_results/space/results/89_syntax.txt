To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Given the current situation, Zoe is on the spaceship, and the Lizard is on the surface, where the volcano is active. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to confront the Lizard. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. Since the Lizard is on the surface, he will die as a result of the eruption.

The final outcome will be that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption, but the Lizard will die due to the volcanic eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting back to the surface** allows Zoe to engage with the Lizard directly.
- **Making peace** is essential for establishing a positive relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.
- **Beginning the eruption** and then **erupting** are necessary to fulfill the story's requirement of a character dying due to the volcano.
