In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is currently with Casey, C2), and Blake has item I1 (jewelry). 

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, Blake can trade the jewelry (I1) for the flowers (I2) that Casey wants. This will make both Alex and Casey happy, as Alex will receive the item he wants (I3) from Casey, and Casey will receive the item she wants (I2) from Blake. 

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) with Casey for the flowers (I3) in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Casey the item she wants, which in turn allows Alex to receive the item he wants from Casey, thus making everyone happy.

After this trade, the happiness status will be:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because he has I3 (flowers).
- Casey (C2) will be happy because she has I2 (jewelry).
- Blake (C3) will be happy because he has I3 (flowers).

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This single action effectively resolves the situation, ensuring that Blake achieves their goal of happiness while also making Alex and Casey happy.
