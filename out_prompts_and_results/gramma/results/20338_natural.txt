To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the crossroads, where she can potentially interact with the hero or the guard.

2. **The bandit attacks the hero.**  
   - The bandit is armed and can attack the hero, who is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to eliminate the hero and take the hero's coin.

3. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the hero.**  
   - After defeating the hero, the bandit can take the hero's coin, which adds to her collection of coins.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store her newly acquired coins.

5. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the crossroads to position herself strategically.
- By attacking the hero, she eliminates a non-criminal character and gains a coin without becoming a criminal herself.
- Looting the hero's coin is a direct way to increase her wealth.
- Returning to the bandit camp allows her to secure her coins in a safe location.
- Finally, placing the coins in the chest fulfills her goal of having coins stored.
