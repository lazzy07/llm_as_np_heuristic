To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Similarly, Hathaway should assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for the same reasons as above.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young to determine his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their conditions.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential for Jones to become healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary for Ross to become healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is crucial for Young to become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
