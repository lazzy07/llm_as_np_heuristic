To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial as it sets the foundation for cooperation and mutual safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe is in the cave, she will make peace with the Lizard again. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in each other's presence.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk back to the surface with Zoe. This action is important as it allows them to explore the surface together, further strengthening their bond.

5. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will begin to erupt. This action introduces a sense of urgency and danger, but since both characters are now friends, they can work together to find safety.

6. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk back to the cave to escape the eruption. This action is necessary for both characters to find safety from the volcanic eruption.

7. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk back to the cave, ensuring that both characters are safe from the eruption.

8. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are in the cave, they remain safe.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
