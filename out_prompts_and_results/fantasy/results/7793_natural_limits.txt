In the village, Talia and Rory are married, but they lack wealth. Gargax, the dragon, is also in the village and desires wealth. Vince, who is dead, has the money, which Gargax wants. To achieve her goal of being wealthy, Talia needs to acquire the money.

1. Gargax eats Rory. (This action allows Gargax to eliminate a potential obstacle and gain access to Rory's wealth, which is indirectly linked to Talia's goal.)
2. Gargax takes the money from Rory's body. (This action allows Gargax to fulfill his desire for wealth, which indirectly benefits Talia since she is married to Rory.)

After these actions, Talia is now wealthy through her marriage to Rory, who has been eaten by Gargax, allowing her to achieve her goal of being happy and wealthy.
