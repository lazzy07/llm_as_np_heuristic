In this story, Zoe is currently safe on her spaceship, while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe, and to make friends with the Lizard, who also desires safety and friendship.

Given the current situation, the best action for Zoe is to teleport back to the surface to confront the Lizard and attempt to make peace. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to engage with the Lizard directly, which is essential for building a friendship. However, since the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, this action will ultimately lead to Zoe's demise.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to interact with the Lizard and attempt to make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends. 

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. This action results in the death of Zoe, as she is on the surface when the eruption occurs.

The story concludes with Zoe dying due to the eruption, but she successfully attempts to make peace with the Lizard, which may lead to a future friendship.
