Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and both are healthy but not safe. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Since she is friends with the Lizard, she hopes to return to help the Lizard as well.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to assist the Lizard, demonstrating her commitment to their friendship and mutual safety.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They both walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action ensures that both characters are safe from the danger of the eruption.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

By following these actions, Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
