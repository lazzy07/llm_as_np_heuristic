**Story Completion:**

As day one progresses, Ernest realizes he needs to do his chores to avoid drawing the attention of the guards. He decides to leave his cell and head to the laundry room to find Roy. 

1. **Ernest moves to the laundry room.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to find Roy and discuss their situation.)
   
Once in the laundry room, Ernest finds Roy, who is still holding the pack of cigarettes. They both know the bully is a threat, and they need to come up with a plan. However, the bully is still in the gym, and they are not yet in immediate danger.

2. **Ernest and Roy discuss their options.** (This action is implied as they strategize together, but it does not need to be explicitly stated in the action list.)

After some discussion, they realize that they need to get rid of the cigarettes to avoid the bully's wrath. They decide that Roy should return the cigarettes to the bully to appease him temporarily.

3. **Roy moves to the gym to return the cigarettes.** (This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and try to diffuse the situation.)

In the gym, Roy hands over the cigarettes to the bully, who is momentarily pleased but still has a violent streak. The bully, feeling empowered, decides to assert his dominance.

4. **The bully threatens Roy and Ernest again.** (This action reinforces the bully's control over the situation and shows that he is still a threat.)

Feeling emboldened by the return of his cigarettes, the bully decides to take action against both Roy and Ernest. He moves to the laundry room to confront them directly.

5. **The bully moves to the laundry room.** (This action is necessary for the bully to confront both main characters and assert his dominance.)

Once in the laundry room, the bully threatens both Ernest and Roy, making it clear that he will not tolerate any further disrespect. 

6. **The bully kills Roy.** (This action fulfills the bully's goal of eliminating a threat and asserting his power.)

With Roy dead, the bully now feels secure in his position and has achieved his goal of killing someone he has threatened.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by the characters is aimed at either avoiding confrontation with the bully or directly confronting him. The story progresses logically, with the bully's actions leading to the ultimate goal of killing Roy, which he achieves by asserting his dominance and eliminating a threat.
