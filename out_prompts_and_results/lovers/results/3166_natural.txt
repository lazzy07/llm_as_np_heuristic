To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey, where the flowers are located.

2. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers.**  
   - Blake is trying to help Alex by informing Casey of Alex's desire for the flowers, which may prompt Casey to act.

3. **Casey gives the flowers to Blake.**  
   - Since Casey wants to make Blake happy, and Blake has just informed Casey of Alex's desire for the flowers, Casey decides to give the flowers to Blake.

4. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - Blake, now holding the flowers, wants to make Alex happy and gives the flowers to Alex.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers and will be happy.
