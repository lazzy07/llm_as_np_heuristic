To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I3) they have with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want directly from Casey, who currently has it.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey (C2) will have the flowers (I3) and will not be happy, but this does not affect Alex's goal.
- Blake (C3) remains in the same state, but their happiness is not relevant to Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want in exchange for the flowers they have, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
