In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market, where she has just attacked the Merchant and taken the Medicine from Tom. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit already has the Medicine, she can now focus on her goal of acquiring coins.

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp and take the coins that are in the chest. This action allows her to fulfill her goal of having coins in her possession.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to the Bandit achieving her goal of carrying coins. The Bandit is already armed and in a position to take the coins without any opposition since the Merchant is dead, and the Guard is not in a position to stop her.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for the Bandit to achieve her goal in the current situation.
