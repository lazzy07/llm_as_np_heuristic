To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomA to confirm the symptoms. Since Young has already been assigned to this room and has a known symptom (SymptomA), this action is necessary to determine the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. Since Young has SymptomA, Hathaway will treat Young for Jarkis with steroids, which is the correct treatment for the rash symptom.

3. **Walk Ross to Admissions**: After treating Young, Ross will walk to the Admissions room. This action is not directly related to Young's goal but is necessary to clear the room for Hathaway to focus on the next patient.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to, which indirectly supports Young's goal by maintaining a healthy environment in the hospital.

5. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that all patients are healthy, which aligns with Young's goal of being in a healthy environment.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Confirms Young's symptoms.
2. **Treat Young**: Cures Young of Jarkis, making them healthy.
3. **Walk Ross to Admissions**: Clears the room for Hathaway.
4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: Ensures all patients are being attended to.
5. **Assess Jones**: Determines Jones's symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones**: Cures Jones, ensuring a healthy environment.

With these actions, Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, and the hospital environment is maintained for all patients.
