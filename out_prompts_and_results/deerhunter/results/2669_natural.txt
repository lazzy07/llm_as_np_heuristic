To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to return to the forest after successfully stealing the money.

4. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - Since Bubba is hungry and Bambi is alive in the forest, he can choose to eat Bambi, which would result in Bambi being dead.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This is the direct action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
- **Returning to the forest**: This is a logical step for Bubba to take after acquiring the money, as he may want to hide or consume his meal in a familiar environment.
- **Deciding to eat Bambi**: This action fulfills the requirement of having Bambi dead, which is one of the possible endings.
