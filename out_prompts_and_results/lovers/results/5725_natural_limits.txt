In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since Casey believes that the jewelry is with Alex, they decide to take action.

Casey tells Alex, "I want the jewelry." This is a lie, as Casey actually wants the jewelry. However, this prompts Alex to think about the jewelry and realize that they have it. 

Next, Casey picks up the flowers from the bathroom. Now, Casey has the flowers, which they believe are in the bathroom. 

Finally, Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the flowers they wanted. 

At this point, Casey is still not happy because they do not have the jewelry, but they have successfully achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

1. Casey tells Alex they want the jewelry (a lie) to redirect Alex's focus.
