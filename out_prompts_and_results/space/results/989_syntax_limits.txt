Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She sees the Lizard nearby and realizes that they both want to be healthy and safe. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard and make peace. 

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**  
This action is chosen because Zoe's goal is to make friends with the Lizard, and since they are not currently fighting, this is the best opportunity to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, they can work together to ensure their safety.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can collaborate to find a safe place away from the volcano, fulfilling both of their goals of being healthy and safe.

**Final Story:**
Zoe approaches the Lizard on the surface and says, "Let's work together to stay safe from the volcano!" The Lizard nods in agreement, and they both move away from the dangerous area, forming a friendship.
