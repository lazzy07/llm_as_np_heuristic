In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, but her happiness is at 0. To achieve her goal, Talia needs to ensure that she is happy. 

Since Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, she can propose to one of them to increase her happiness. However, since she is already married to both, she can simply accept one of their proposals to solidify her happiness.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

2. Talia accepts Rory's proposal. (This action increases Talia's happiness to 1, as she is now happy being married to Rory.)

Now, Talia has achieved her goal of being happy and wealthy.
