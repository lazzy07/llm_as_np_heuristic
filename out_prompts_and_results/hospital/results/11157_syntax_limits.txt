**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment. Given Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but assessing is essential to move forward.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's health, aiming to make him healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young also receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Jones** is the first step to identify his condition. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot provide the appropriate treatment, which is essential for achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
  
- **Treating Jones** with antibiotics is the next logical step after assessment. If Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy, which is Hathaway's goal.

- **Assessing Young** is included to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated correctly. This action is necessary to maintain the focus on the overall health of all patients, not just Jones.
