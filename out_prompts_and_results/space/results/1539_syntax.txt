To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Given the current situation, the best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety, while the Lizard remains on the surface. This action will not anger the Lizard since they are currently at peace. After Zoe is safe, she can then send a signal from the spaceship to communicate with the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe wants to be healthy and safe.

2. **send_signal(Zoe, Lizard)**: Zoe sends a signal from the spaceship to the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship. This action is implied as a way to maintain their relationship and achieve Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

The final story is as follows:

Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface, decides to teleport back to her spaceship. She knows that her safety is paramount, and being on the spaceship will protect her from any potential threats. Once aboard, she sends a signal to the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and ensuring that they can communicate in the future. This action solidifies their bond, achieving both Zoe's and the Lizard's goals of friendship and safety.
