In the current situation, Casey (C2) is unhappy because they want the jewelry (I2), which is located in the dining room (R21). To achieve their goal of happiness, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry. 

Since Alex (C1) is currently happy with the chocolates (I1) and is in the living room (R12), they can help Casey by giving them the jewelry. However, Alex does not have the jewelry; it is in the dining room. 

Blake (C3) is also happy with the flowers (I3) and is in the living room (R12). To help Casey, Blake can tell Alex that Casey wants the jewelry, which is a lie since Casey actually wants the jewelry. This will prompt Alex to move to the dining room to pick up the jewelry and give it to Casey.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that Casey wants the jewelry. This action is necessary to mislead Alex into thinking they need to help Casey by getting the jewelry.

2. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to find the jewelry. This action is necessary for Alex to reach the location of the jewelry.

3. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to obtain the item that Casey wants.

4. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room with the jewelry. This action is necessary for Alex to return to where Casey is.

5. **give(C1, I2, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey. This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
