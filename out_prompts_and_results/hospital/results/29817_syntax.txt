To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomA with Ross, and Ross has already been assigned to this room, Hathaway will assess Ross to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Ross.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms observed. Since Ross has SymptomB, which we will assume corresponds to Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics.

3. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomC where Young is located and assess Young to determine his symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate medication. Assuming Young has a rash (SymptomA), he will be treated with steroids.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting there.

6. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate medication. Assuming Jones has a fever (Flaze), he will be treated with antibiotics.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
