To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Casey (C3) tells Alex (C1) that they want the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R22)**. This action is necessary because it reinforces Casey's desire for the jewelry and sets the stage for Alex to act on this information.
   
   - Action: `tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)`

2. **Alex (C1) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R22)**. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
   
   - Action: `give(C1, I3, C3, R22)`

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they want, making them happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action establishes communication about what Casey wants, which is crucial for Alex to understand the need to help.
- The second action is the key moment where Casey receives the item they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
