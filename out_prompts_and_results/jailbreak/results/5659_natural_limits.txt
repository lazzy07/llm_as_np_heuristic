**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy realized that the bully would soon be out of the gym. He needed to act quickly to ensure both he and Ernest would be safe. 

Roy decided to take a risk. He moved from the kitchen to the hallway, where he could hear the sounds of the gym. He locked the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action would prevent the bully from coming after them and give them a chance to escape.

With the gym door locked, Roy quickly put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier. Now disguised, he felt a surge of confidence. He crawled through the vents to the highway outside the prison, where he could finally escape.

Once on the highway, Roy took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the prison lift off his shoulders. He was free.
