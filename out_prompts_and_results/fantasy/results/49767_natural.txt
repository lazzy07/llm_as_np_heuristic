To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - This action is necessary for Rory to be with Talia and Vince, who are both at the village. Rory needs to be in a location where he can interact with them to achieve his goals.

2. **Rory proposes to Talia.** - Since Talia is already married to Rory, this action is redundant but serves to reinforce their relationship. It also aligns with Rory's desire for happiness.

3. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** - This action solidifies their relationship and increases Rory's happiness.

4. **Rory picks up the money.** - Rory needs to become wealthy, and since Vince has the money, he can pick it up after traveling to the village.

5. **Rory's happiness increases.** - By marrying Talia and picking up the money, Rory achieves happiness.

6. **Rory's wealth increases.** - By picking up the money, Rory achieves wealth.

7. **Rory's hunger remains at 0.** - Since no character has become hungry, Rory remains not hungry.

At the end of these actions, Rory has achieved all of his goals: he is happy, wealthy, and not hungry.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Rory travels from the cave to the village.",
    "Rory proposes to Talia.",
    "Talia accepts Rory's proposal.",
    "Rory picks up the money."
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Traveling to the village** allows Rory to be in the same location as Talia and Vince, which is essential for any further actions.
- **Proposing to Talia** reinforces their relationship and is a step towards achieving happiness.
- **Accepting the proposal** by Talia ensures that both characters are happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.
- **Picking up the money** directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy. 

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way for Rory to achieve his goals given the constraints of the story.
