To achieve Blake's goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy, we need to ensure that Alex receives the item they want (I1) and that Blake can also obtain their desired item (I2). 

Here's the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pick up the item they want (I2).
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the item (I2) in the dining room.
3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room where Alex and Casey are.
4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the item (I2) to Alex, making Alex happy.
5. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the item (I3).
6. **pick_up(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey picks up the item (I3) in the dining room.
7. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room.
8. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the item (I3) to Alex, ensuring Alex is happy.

At this point, all characters are happy because:
- Alex has received I1 (the item they wanted) from Blake.
- Blake has I2 (the item they wanted) from the dining room.
- Casey has I3 (the item they wanted) from the dining room.
