To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will initiate a peace-making action with the Lizard while they are both in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that Zoe can explore the planet further and assess the situation on the surface, which is currently dangerous.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe to the surface. This action is important as it shows that the Lizard is now willing to accompany Zoe, indicating a budding friendship and mutual safety.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface will begin to erupt. This action introduces a new element of danger that Zoe and the Lizard must address together.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a hazardous environment. This action is included to heighten the stakes and test the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.

6. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk back to the cave to seek safety from the eruption. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her health and safety.

7. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk back to the cave, ensuring its own safety. This action reinforces the idea that they are now allies, working together to stay safe.

By completing these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
