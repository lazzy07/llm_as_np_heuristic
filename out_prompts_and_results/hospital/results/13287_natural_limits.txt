Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway confirms that he has a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, but since Hathaway's workload is now manageable (only 1), he can assess Young without making a mistake. 

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, making Young healthy as well.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved his goal.
