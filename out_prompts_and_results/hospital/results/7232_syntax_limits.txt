**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Jones is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway determines that he has a fever, which indicates Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Rash, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway then walks to PatientRoomC to assess Young. Since Young is in a different room, Hathaway's workload is now reduced to 2, minimizing the risk of error. Hathaway assesses Young to check for symptoms of Jarkis.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomC**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Young also becomes healthy.
