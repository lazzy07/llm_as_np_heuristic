To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged, and she has the treasure. The goal is to solidify their relationship through marriage, which will make both of them happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels to the Village to be with Talia, as they need to be in the same location to get married.
   - **Reason**: This action is necessary for Vince to be present with Talia to propose marriage.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married in the Village.
   - **Reason**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage, and since Vince is also happy with the marriage, it aligns with both their goals.

3. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money that Vince has in the Village.
   - **Reason**: This action allows Talia to become wealthy, as she now has both the treasure and the money.

After these actions, Talia will be happy (due to her marriage to Vince) and wealthy (due to having both the treasure and the money).
