**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, who is currently in the kitchen, decides to take action. He knows that he has the knife and is aware that Ernest is in the gym with the bully. Since the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest, Roy makes a crucial decision. He moves from the kitchen to the hallway, then crawls through the vents to the gym. 

Once in the gym, Roy sees the bully and knows this is his chance. He uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to kill the bully, eliminating the threat once and for all. With the bully dead, Roy can now ensure that both he and Ernest can live without fear.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **go(Roy, Hall)**: Roy moves from the kitchen to the hallway to access the gym where Ernest and the bully are located.
2. **vent(Roy, Gym)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym, allowing him to surprise the bully.
3. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: Roy kills the bully with the knife, removing the threat to both himself and Ernest.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and not threatened, as it directly addresses the bully's threat.
