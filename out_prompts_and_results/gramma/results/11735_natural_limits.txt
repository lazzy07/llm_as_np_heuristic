Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant, who has the medicine he desires. Knowing that the bandit is at the market and the guard is also there, Tom decides to take action to ensure he can safely retrieve the medicine.

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence at the market, which could lead to the bandit being dealt with. Tom is not a criminal, so he can safely report without fear of repercussions.

2. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.** This action allows Tom to reach the market where the merchant is located, ensuring he can obtain the medicine after the guard has dealt with the bandit.

After these actions, the guard arrives at the market, confronts the bandit, and either captures or kills her. With the bandit out of the way, Tom can now approach the merchant and retrieve the medicine without any threat.
