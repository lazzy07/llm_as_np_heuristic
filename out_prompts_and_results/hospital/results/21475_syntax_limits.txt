### Story Completion

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's health issue, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment as well.

4. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway treats Ross with steroids if he shows symptoms of Jarkis. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.
