To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to maintain the flow of the story and keep the characters together.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is included because Casey wants the jewelry (I2), and by giving the flowers to Casey, Alex can help Casey achieve their happiness.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the jewelry. This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item they want.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry. This action is essential for Casey to achieve their happiness.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room. This action is included to keep the characters together.

8. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action helps Blake achieve their happiness.

9. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates. This action is necessary for Blake to obtain the item they want.

10. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This action is essential for Blake to achieve their happiness.

After these actions, all characters will be happy because they will have the items they want.
