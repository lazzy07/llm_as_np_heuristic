In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to be safe and make friends with the Lizard, while the Lizard also desires safety and friendship. 

To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and ensuring that one character dies while also allowing for friendship to form, the following action will be taken:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a necessary action to fulfill the condition of the story where a character dies. Since Zoe is on the surface when the eruption occurs, she will die.

This action is the only one needed to meet the conditions of the story. The eruption of the volcano leads to Zoe's demise, but it also serves as a catalyst for the Lizard to reflect on the importance of friendship and safety, potentially leading to a future connection with other creatures.
