Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting to have money. To achieve his goal of having 1 money, he needs to find a way to get more money. Since he has the rifle and ammunition, he can use it to hunt Bambi, which will provide him with food and potentially allow him to take Bambi's money if she has any.

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat. Shooting Bambi will provide him with food.
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** This action is the execution of the previous decision. It allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, satisfying his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money because he has eaten Bambi, which fulfills his hunger and allows him to focus on his financial goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.",
    "Bubba shoots Bambi.",
    "Bubba eats Bambi."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger.
