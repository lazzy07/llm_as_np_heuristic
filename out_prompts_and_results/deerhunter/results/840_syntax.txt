To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed for money. The clerk is also greedy but is not hungry. Bambi, the deer, is alive in the forest.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting to secure the money, decides to shoot the clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk as a threat and to take the money without resistance.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but can be included to show Bubba's next move.

The story ends with Bubba having the money after shooting the clerk, and Bambi remains alive since Bubba did not interact with her.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential obstacle to obtaining the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of having money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is included to show Bubba's movement after achieving his goal, although it does not affect the outcome.
