To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit needs to go to the market to find the merchant, who has the medicine and is a potential target for robbery.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the merchant who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant, which is valuable.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - After robbing the merchant, the bandit will return to the bandit camp to secure the stolen medicine and any coins she may have.

4. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action ensures that the medicine is safely stored in the chest, fulfilling the bandit's goal of having valuable items secured.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal by robbing the merchant and securing the medicine in her camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the market**: This is necessary for the bandit to confront the merchant and attempt to rob her.
- **Robbing the merchant**: This is the key action that allows the bandit to gain valuable items (the medicine) without needing to kill anyone, thus avoiding the guard's attention.
- **Walking back to the bandit camp**: This secures the stolen items and keeps them safe from the guard.
- **Placing the medicine in the chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit has achieved her goal of having valuable items stored safely.
