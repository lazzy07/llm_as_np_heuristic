To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, and she has accepted both proposals. However, she has not yet acquired any wealth or treasure, which is essential for her happiness.

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is located in the cave, and Vince needs to go there to retrieve it.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which is essential for Talia's happiness and wealth.

3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village with the treasure to share it with Talia.

4. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action is crucial because it allows Talia to become wealthy, which is one of her goals.

5. **Talia's happiness increases.**  
   - With the treasure, Talia's wealth increases, which contributes to her happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Vince travels from the village to the cave:** To reach the treasure.
- **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave:** To acquire the treasure needed for Talia's happiness and wealth.
- **Vince travels from the cave to the village:** To return with the treasure.
- **Vince gives the treasure to Talia:** To fulfill Talia's desire for wealth, which leads to her happiness.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy, and since her goal is to be happy and wealthy, she will achieve her desired outcome.
