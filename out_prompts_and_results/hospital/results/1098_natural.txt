**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is currently in Patient Room B, this assessment will help identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Young shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), this treatment is essential for Young to become healthy. If Young does not have Flaze, this action could lead to a negative outcome, but since the goal is for Young to be healthy, we will assume the assessment indicated Flaze.

3. **Young walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Young to achieve their goal of being healthy, but it allows Young to move to a different room, possibly to check on other patients or to be in a more comfortable environment after treatment.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to gather information about Young's condition, which is necessary for effective treatment.
- The second action directly addresses Young's health by providing the correct treatment based on the assessment. This is the key action that ensures Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.
- The third action is more about Young's movement and does not impact the health outcome but adds to the narrative of Young's experience in the hospital.
