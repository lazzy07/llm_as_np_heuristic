**Story Completion:**

After Roy successfully disguised himself with the civilian clothes and crawled through the vents to the highway, he found himself outside the prison. He took a moment to catch his breath, feeling the weight of the prison walls lift off his shoulders. With the pack of cigarettes in his possession, he felt a sense of victory. He knew he had to escape while he could.

Meanwhile, inside the prison, Ernest remained in the cell block, feeling threatened by the bully. He knew he had to find a way to escape as well, but he was trapped and unable to act without risking his life. 

On the highway, Roy took a deep breath and put on the civilian clothes, blending in with the outside world. He walked away from the prison, feeling free for the first time in a long while.
