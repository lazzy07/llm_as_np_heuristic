In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in a critical situation with three patients: Young, Ross, and Jones. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat them effectively. 

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room A to assess Young. Since Young is currently in Admissions, Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis. This is crucial because Hathaway's workload is already at 3, and any mistake could lead to a misdiagnosis.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action reduces Hathaway's workload by one and successfully makes Young healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is in Exam Room B. If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway can treat him accordingly. If he has a rash, Hathaway will treat him for Jarkis. 

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy as well.

5. **Walk to Admissions to Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones. Since Jones is the last patient, it is essential to ensure he is healthy too.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, making him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
