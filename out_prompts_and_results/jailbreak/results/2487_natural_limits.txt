**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison continued, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, stood in the hallway, contemplating his next move. He knew that Ernest was in the cells, threatened by the bully, and he needed to act quickly to ensure both of their safety.

Roy decided to crawl through the vents to the kitchen, where he knew the knife was located. He needed the knife to defend himself and Ernest against the bully. After successfully navigating through the vents, he reached the kitchen and grabbed the knife.

With the knife in hand, Roy crawled back through the vents to the hallway. He then moved to the gym door, which was still locked. Knowing that the bully was inside, he unlocked the door and entered the gym, confronting the bully.

In a swift motion, Roy used the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest would no longer be threatened. With the bully out of the way, Roy could now focus on escaping with Ernest.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Crawl through the vents to the kitchen**: This action allows Roy to access the knife without being seen by the bully, ensuring his safety while obtaining a crucial item for defense.
   
2. **Steal the knife**: Acquiring the knife is essential for Roy to protect himself and Ernest from the bully's threats.

3. **Crawl back through the vents to the hallway**: This keeps Roy hidden from the bully while he prepares to confront him.

4. **Unlock the gym door**: This action is necessary to confront the bully directly, as the gym is where the bully is located.

5. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened, allowing Roy to achieve his goal of survival and safety.
