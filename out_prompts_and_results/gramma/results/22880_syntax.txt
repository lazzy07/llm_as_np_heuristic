To achieve the guard's goal of killing criminals, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The guard will walk to the bandit camp, where the bandit is located. This action is necessary because the guard needs to confront the bandit to fulfill his goal of killing a criminal.

2. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: The guard will attack the bandit at the bandit camp. This action is essential as it directly leads to the guard's goal of eliminating a criminal.

3. **loot(Guard, BanditSword, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: After successfully attacking and killing the bandit, the guard will loot the bandit’s sword. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the guard's goal but adds to the narrative by showing the guard's efficiency in dealing with criminals.

The story is concise and focuses solely on the guard's actions to achieve his goal of killing criminals, specifically the bandit.
