To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard is currently on the surface and will walk to the cave. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard closer to Zoe, as they need to be in the same location to interact.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary because the volcano is on the surface, and we want both characters to be present there when it erupts.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will begin to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption, which will lead to a character's demise.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. Since Zoe is on the ship and the Lizard is on the surface, the Lizard will die due to the eruption.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: After the eruption, Zoe can make peace with the Lizard. This action is necessary to establish a friendship, even though the Lizard has died. The act of making peace symbolizes Zoe's intention to befriend the Lizard, fulfilling her goal of making friends.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. The Lizard walks to the cave.
2. Zoe walks to the surface.
3. The volcano begins to erupt.
4. The volcano erupts, killing the Lizard.
5. Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, symbolizing their friendship.

### Explanation of Actions:
