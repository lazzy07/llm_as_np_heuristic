To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, we need to ensure that he can obtain the medicine from the merchant without being interrupted by the bandit or the guard. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the cottage, so she will walk to the crossroads to potentially ambush Tom or the merchant. This action is necessary to create a situation where Tom can act without immediate threat.

2. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: Tom walks from the cottage to the crossroads. This is necessary for him to move towards the merchant to buy the medicine.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market, leaving the crossroads. This is crucial because it removes the immediate threat of the bandit from Tom's path.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom walks to the market to meet the merchant and buy the medicine. This is essential for him to achieve his goal of obtaining the medicine.

5. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using the coin he has. This action is necessary for Tom to acquire the medicine.

6. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom walks back to the crossroads with the medicine. This is necessary for him to return to the cottage.

7. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks back to the cottage, completing his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit initially moves to the crossroads and then to the market, which ensures she is not in the way when Tom tries to buy the medicine.
- Tom's movements are strategic to ensure he can reach the merchant without encountering the bandit or the guard.
- The buy action is crucial as it allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires.
- The final two walk actions return Tom to the cottage, fulfilling his goal.
