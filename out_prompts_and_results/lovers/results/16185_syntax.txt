To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I3) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the chocolates they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the jewelry (I1) and will also be happy since they wanted to make Alex happy.
- Casey will still be unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills the requirement.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I3) for the jewelry (I1) with Alex in the living room (R22). This is the key action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the chocolates they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they desire.
