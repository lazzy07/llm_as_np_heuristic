To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R12) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to maintain social connections.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to check on Alex. This action is included to show Casey's concern for Alex's happiness.

5. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21) to join Alex and Casey. This action emphasizes the social aspect of the story.

6. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to make Casey happy, which is also part of Alex's goal.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, and Casey is also happy because they received the flowers.
