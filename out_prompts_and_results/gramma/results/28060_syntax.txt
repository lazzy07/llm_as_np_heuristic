To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can acquire the medicine from the merchant and then make his way back to the cottage. Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **loot(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: Tom can loot the medicine from the corpse of the merchant since he has just killed her. This action is necessary for Tom to obtain the medicine he desires.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After looting the medicine, Tom needs to walk from the market to the crossroads. This action is essential for him to progress towards the cottage.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage. This action completes his journey to his desired location.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- **loot**: Tom loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse, which is crucial for him to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.
- **walk**: Tom walks to the crossroads, moving closer to his goal.
- **walk**: Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, reaching his final destination.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "loot(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
