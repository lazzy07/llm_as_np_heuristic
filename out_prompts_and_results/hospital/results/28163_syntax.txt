To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to confirm his symptoms. Since Ross has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway will know that Ross has Jarkis and needs steroids.
