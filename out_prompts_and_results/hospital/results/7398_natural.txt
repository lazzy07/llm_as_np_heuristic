**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A and confirms he has Fever. Since Fever is a symptom of Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. After admitting Young, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B, but since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. Unfortunately, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to check on Ross, who is now healthy.
