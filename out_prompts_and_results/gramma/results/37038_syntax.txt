To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count, which is one of her goals.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action (robbing Tom) is crucial as it directly increases the bandit's coin count, which is essential for her goal.
- The second action (walking to the camp) is necessary to move to a secure location where she can store her coins.
- The third action (taking the coins from the chest) finalizes her goal of having coins in a safe place.
