To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to walk back to the cottage from the crossroads. Since he already has the medicine, this single action will fulfill his objective.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, successfully carrying the medicine with him.

This action is necessary because it directly leads Tom to his desired location (the cottage) while ensuring he has the medicine, which is his goal.
