To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because Alex needs to give away the jewelry to make Casey happy, and in return, Alex will receive the flowers, which is not their goal but helps in the overall happiness of the group.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) will give the jewelry (I1) back to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action allows Alex to interact with Casey and exchange items, which is a strategic move to ensure that Alex can eventually get the jewelry back.
- The give action is essential as it directly results in Alex obtaining the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
