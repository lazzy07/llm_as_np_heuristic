To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be on the surface when the volcano erupts to fulfill the condition of a character dying.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.**  
   - This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to the death of the Lizard.

3. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - Zoe needs to be on the surface to witness the eruption and to ensure that she and the Lizard can still be friends despite the Lizard's fate.

4. **The Lizard dies due to the eruption.**  
   - This is the consequence of the volcano erupting while the Lizard is on the surface.

5. **Zoe mourns the Lizard and remembers their friendship.**  
   - This action solidifies the bond they had, ensuring that even in death, the Lizard is remembered as a friend.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and the preservation of the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
