**Story Completion:**

On day one, Roy, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to protect himself and Ernest. First, he sneaks through the vents from the laundry room to the gym, where the bully is currently working out. 

Once inside the gym, Roy sees the bully distracted. He takes out the knife he stole from the kitchen and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. This act of revenge not only eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest but also secures the pack of cigarettes for himself.
