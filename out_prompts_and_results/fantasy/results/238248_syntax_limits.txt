To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action is necessary because Rory has already proposed to Talia and accepted her proposal, which means he is happy. However, he is not wealthy since he only has the treasure and not the money. By being eaten, Rory will no longer be hungry, and since he is already happy, he achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy (through the treasure), and not hungry (as he is no longer alive).

This is the shortest story that allows Rory to achieve his goals, as it requires only one action.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action fulfills Rory's goal of not being hungry, as he is consumed by Gargax. Although it may seem counterintuitive, in the context of the story, it allows Rory to achieve his goals of happiness (from his relationships) and wealth (from the treasure he possesses).
