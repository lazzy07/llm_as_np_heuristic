To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) to be closer to Alex and Blake, who are both in the same room.
   
2. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Alex actually wants the flowers (I1). However, this misinformation may lead Blake to act in a way that helps Alex indirectly.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R12) to check on the chocolates (I2) and potentially give them to Alex.

4. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R12).

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) with the chocolates (I2) to give them to Alex.

6. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1). This action does not make Alex happy, but it shows Blake's intention to help.

7. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to check on the flowers (I1).

8. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R12).

9. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Blake and Casey.

At this point, Alex has the flowers (I1) and is happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake, facilitating communication.
- The second action is a strategic lie that may lead Blake to act in a way that ultimately helps Alex.
- The third and fourth actions allow Blake to retrieve the chocolates, showing his willingness to help Alex.
- The fifth and sixth actions are Blake's attempt to give something to Alex, which is a part of his goal to make Alex happy.
- The seventh and eighth actions are crucial for Alex to finally obtain the flowers, which is what he truly wants.
- The final action brings Alex back to the living room, where he can share his happiness with Blake and Casey.
