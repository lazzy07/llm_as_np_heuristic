To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk without any resistance.
2. **Go**: Bubba will then go to the forest where Bambi is located. 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal the money from the clerk without any risk of being stopped. This action directly leads to Bubba having the money.
- **Go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba moves to the forest. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story, as it allows for the potential of encountering Bambi, who is alive and in the forest.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money, achieving the desired outcome of the story.
