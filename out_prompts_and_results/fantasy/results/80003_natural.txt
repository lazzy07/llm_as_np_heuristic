To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, but she is not happy. To make Talia happy, we can have her propose to Rory again, and since they are already married, this will reaffirm their bond and increase her happiness.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **Talia proposes to Rory again.** - This action is necessary because Talia wants to reaffirm her relationship with Rory, which will contribute to her happiness.
2. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.** - Rory accepting the proposal will make Talia happy, as they are already married, but this action will still count towards her happiness.
3. **Talia and Rory are married.** - This action is already established, but it reinforces their bond and ensures Talia's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Talia proposes to Rory again.** - Talia wants to be happy, and proposing again will strengthen their relationship.
2. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.** - This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

After these actions, Talia will be happy, achieving her goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Talia proposes to Rory again.",
    "Rory accepts Talia's proposal."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia becomes happy while keeping the story within the established parameters.
