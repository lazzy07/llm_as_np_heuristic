To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Talia is at the cave with Gargax, and Gargax wants to eat a human. By eating Talia, Gargax will become wealthy (by taking Talia's wealth) and not hungry, which aligns with Gargax's goals.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure**: After eating Talia, Gargax can take the treasure that is at the cave. This action will increase Gargax's wealth further.

3. **Rory travels to the cave**: Rory will travel from the village to the cave to confront Gargax and retrieve the money that Vince has.

4. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body**: Since Vince is at the village and is not directly involved in the cave scene, we assume he is dead after Talia's demise. Rory can take the money from Vince's body, thus achieving wealth.

5. **Rory becomes happy**: With the money in hand, Rory can now feel happy as they have achieved their goal of wealth and are not hungry.

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves their goal while also considering the motivations of the other characters.
