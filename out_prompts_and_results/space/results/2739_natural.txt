Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She knows that the Lizard is the guardian of the surface and that they need to work together to survive the eruption. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and address the situation directly, as she believes the Lizard is not the guardian and needs to understand the truth.

2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to make peace.** - Since they are not fighting, Zoe can try to establish a friendship. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends and ensures they can work together to survive.

3. **The Lizard accepts Zoe's offer of friendship.** - This action solidifies their relationship, allowing them to cooperate in the face of danger.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is inevitable given the story's setup, and it leads to the climax of the story.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to escape the eruption, ensuring both characters survive.

In this sequence, Zoe's actions lead to a friendship with the Lizard, which is essential for their mutual safety. The eruption serves as a dramatic backdrop that emphasizes the urgency of their situation.
