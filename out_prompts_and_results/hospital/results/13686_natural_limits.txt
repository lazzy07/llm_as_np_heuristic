Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to reduce the number of patients in the admissions room and allows Hathaway to start assessing Young's condition.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.** This action is essential for Hathaway to assess Young, who has just been admitted to Patient Room C.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently unknown. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of confusion from other patients.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway can ensure that Young receives the necessary treatment, ultimately achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
