Zoe stands on the dangerous surface of the planet, aware of the erupting volcanoes around her. She knows she needs to find a way to be safe and healthy, and perhaps make a friend in the process. 

1. **Zoe walks to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard, who is currently safe in the cave. By walking, she avoids the danger of teleporting, which would anger the Lizard and potentially lead to conflict.

2. **Zoe enters the cave and greets the Lizard.** - This action allows Zoe to initiate a friendly interaction with the Lizard, which is essential for building a relationship. 

3. **Zoe and the Lizard talk about their goals.** - This conversation helps both characters understand that they share similar desires for health, safety, and friendship. 

4. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to become friends.** - By agreeing to be friends, they establish a positive relationship, which is crucial for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard leave the cave together.** - This action signifies their newfound friendship and allows them to explore the planet together, ensuring that they can support each other in the dangerous environment.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This final action ensures that both characters are safe from the erupting volcanoes on the surface, achieving Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
