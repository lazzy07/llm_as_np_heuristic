**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, still in the cells, realizes that the bully is furious about the stolen cigarettes. He knows he must act quickly to protect both himself and Ernest. He decides to sneak through the vents to the gym, where he believes Ernest is being threatened by the bully.

**Action 1:** Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.  
*Explanation:* This action is necessary for Roy to reach Ernest and help him, as the bully is threatening both of them.

Once Roy arrives in the gym, he sees the bully looming over Ernest, who looks scared. Roy knows he has to distract the bully to give Ernest a chance to escape or to take action against the bully.

**Action 2:** Roy throws the pack of cigarettes at the bully, causing a distraction.  
*Explanation:* This action serves to divert the bully's attention away from Ernest, allowing either for a potential escape or for Ernest to take revenge.

With the bully distracted, Ernest seizes the opportunity to grab the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously planned to use against the bully. He lunges at the bully, catching him off guard.

**Ending:** In the ensuing struggle, Ernest manages to kill the bully, overcoming the threat that loomed over both him and Roy. They are now free from the bully's menace, but the cost is high, as the guards will soon come to investigate the commotion.
