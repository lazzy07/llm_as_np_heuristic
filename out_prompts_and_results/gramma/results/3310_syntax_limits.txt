After the events that have transpired, Tom is in the Market, where the Merchant is located with the medicine he desires. The Guard has just attacked the Bandit, who is now dead, leaving Tom with an opportunity to act.

1. **Tom walks from the Market to the Crossroads.** This action is necessary for Tom to move closer to the Merchant, who has the medicine he wants. 

2. **Tom reports the location of the Bandit to the Guard.** By doing this, Tom ensures that the Guard is aware of the Bandit's presence in the Market, which may help him gain favor with the Guard and possibly allow him to safely acquire the medicine from the Merchant afterward.

After these actions, Tom can then approach the Merchant to buy the medicine, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "report(Tom, location(Bandit), Market)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is essential for Tom to get closer to the Merchant and the medicine he needs.
- **report(Tom, location(Bandit), Market)**: This action helps Tom to potentially gain the trust of the Guard, which may facilitate his future interactions with the Merchant and ensure his safety in the Market.
