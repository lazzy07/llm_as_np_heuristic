**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A. Jones, who is in Patient Room B, is experiencing unknown symptoms. To ensure Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, Dr. Hathaway must assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, as she needs to be in the same room as the patient to evaluate their condition.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial because it allows Dr. Hathaway to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, this assessment is essential for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming the assessment reveals that Jones has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate medication. This action is vital for Jones to become healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Jones's health but allows Dr. Hathaway to manage her workload and attend to other patients.

By following these actions, Jones successfully receives the correct treatment and achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat Jones effectively. The assessment is critical to avoid any mistakes due to the doctor's high workload, and the treatment must match the identified symptoms to ensure Jones's survival.
