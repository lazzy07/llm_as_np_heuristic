To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** After stealing the money, Bubba will want to leave the bank to avoid any potential confrontation with the clerk.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.** Now that Bubba has the money, he can satisfy his hunger by eating.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have 1 money, and the clerk has 1 money. This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal.)
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to leave the bank after stealing the money to avoid any trouble.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can now eat, fulfilling his need for food.)

Now, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of having 1 money and has also satisfied his hunger.
