**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomB**  
   - **Explanation:** Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Jones is in PatientRoomB, Hathaway assesses him to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, treatment: antibiotics, room: PatientRoomB**  
   - **Explanation:** After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: Admissions**  
   - **Explanation:** Hathaway then moves to assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated correctly and becomes healthy.

**Final Plan Explanation:**
- The actions taken are focused on assessing and treating the patients to ensure they become healthy. The first two actions are directed towards Jones, who is already in the exam room, and the last action is to assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This sequence allows Hathaway to manage their workload effectively while ensuring both patients receive the necessary care.
