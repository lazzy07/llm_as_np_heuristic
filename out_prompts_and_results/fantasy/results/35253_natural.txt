3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** - This action allows Vince to return to Talia with the treasure.

4. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.** - This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

5. **Talia becomes happy.** - With the treasure now in her possession, Talia achieves her goal of becoming happy.
