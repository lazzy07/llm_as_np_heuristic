To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the power to take the money from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, wanting the money, will decide to steal from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can successfully steal the money from the clerk.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: After stealing the money, Bubba can go to the forest and decide to eat Bambi, fulfilling the condition of Bambi being dead.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money. He has the means (the loaded rifle) to do so.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba achieving his goal of having money, as he takes the clerk's only money.
3. **Bubba goes to the forest**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest.
4. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead, as Bubba consumes her.

The final outcome will be that Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead.
