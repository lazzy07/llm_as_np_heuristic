To complete the story, Tom needs to return to the cottage while carrying the medicine. Given the current situation, Tom is at the crossroads with the medicine, and the merchant is dead, so he doesn't need to worry about any further interactions with her. The guard and the bandit are both at the market, but Tom can avoid them by walking directly to the cottage from the crossroads.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that Tom will take:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the crossroads to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly leads Tom to his desired location with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

In summary, Tom's only action is to walk to the cottage, which allows him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. There are no other necessary actions since the merchant is already dead, and Tom can avoid the guard and bandit by taking the direct path to the cottage.
