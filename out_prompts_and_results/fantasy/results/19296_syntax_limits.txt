To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness through marriage and wealth through acquiring money or treasure. Given the current situation, Talia has already accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which means she can marry either of them. Since Vince has money, marrying him will make Talia wealthy, which aligns with her goal of wanting to be wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Marry Vince**: This action will make Talia happy because she is marrying someone she has accepted a proposal from. Additionally, since Vince has money, Talia will also become wealthy through this marriage.

The story can be completed with the following action:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action results in Talia becoming happy and wealthy, fulfilling her goals.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action is necessary because it directly leads to Talia's happiness (as she is marrying someone she accepted a proposal from) and also makes her wealthy (since Vince has money). 

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["marry(Vince, Talia, Village)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively achieves the desired outcome with the minimum number of actions.
