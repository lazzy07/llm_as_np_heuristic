In this story, Young is currently in Exam Room A, and Hathaway is also in Exam Room A. The goal is for Young to achieve health. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake in assessing or treating patients. However, Young is already in the same room as Hathaway, which allows for a quick assessment and treatment.

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is in Exam Room A, Hathaway can do this without moving. This action is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.
