**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is still in the admissions room, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for Jones's actual condition. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, the treatment does not lead to death.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C with antibiotics, correctly identifying that Ross has Flaze. This treatment successfully makes Ross healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess them.
2. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: This action is crucial for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's condition, even though it leads to a mistake due to the workload.
3. **Treat Jones with steroids**: Although this is a mistake, it is included to show that Dr. Hathaway is attempting to help Jones, and since Jones is alive, the treatment does not result in death.
4. **Treat Ross in Patient Room C with antibiotics**: This action is essential for Ross's recovery, ensuring that he becomes healthy.
