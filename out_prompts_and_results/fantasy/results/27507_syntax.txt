To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory obtaining treasure and ensuring his happiness through marriage with Talia. Here’s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village where Talia is located. This is necessary for Rory to be with Talia to propose marriage.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. This action makes both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: After marrying Talia, Rory travels back to the Cave to pick up the treasure. This is essential for Rory to achieve wealth.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of not being hungry, as Rory will need to eat after obtaining the treasure.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is in the Cave, eats Rory. This action is included to ensure that Rory's story ends with him achieving his goals before his demise.

In this story, Rory achieves his goals of happiness through marriage and wealth by obtaining the treasure. However, he ultimately meets his end at the hands of Gargax, which is a necessary conclusion given the constraints of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Rory, Talia, Village)",
    "pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is strategically chosen to ensure Rory's goals are met while adhering to the constraints of the story.
