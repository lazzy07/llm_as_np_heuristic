To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to be in her preferred location, where she can interact with customers and potentially sell items.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard moves to the crossroads, where he can keep an eye on the merchant and the hero, ensuring that no criminal activities occur.

3. **The bandit walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit moves to the crossroads, where she can potentially confront the merchant or the hero to steal coins.

4. **The merchant buys the hero's coin for the price of one coin.**  
   - The merchant uses her own coins to buy the hero's coin, thus increasing her total coins without committing a crime.

5. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - The merchant moves to the cottage, where she can safely store her items and coins.

6. **The merchant walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant returns to the crossroads to continue her business and interact with other characters.

7. **The guard walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The guard returns to the market to maintain order and ensure that no criminal activities occur.

8. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the camp.**  
   - The bandit returns to her camp, where she can regroup and plan her next move without being in the presence of the guard.

At the end of these actions, the merchant has successfully acquired the hero's coin without engaging in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.
