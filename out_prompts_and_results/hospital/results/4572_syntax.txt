To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well.

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway can assess each patient and provide the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms, ultimately leading to all patients becoming healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient**: This is crucial to determine the correct diagnosis and treatment. Without this step, Hathaway cannot know how to treat each patient effectively.
- **Treating with the correct medication**: Each treatment is based on the diagnosis from the assessment. This ensures that patients receive the right care, which is essential for their recovery.
