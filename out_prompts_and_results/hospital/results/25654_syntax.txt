To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room. This action allows Jones to move to an available exam room.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Jones to exam room B. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2, but it is necessary to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated.

3. **walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Young is also in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room. This action allows Young to move to an available exam room.

4. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Young to exam room C. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room A. Since Ross has already been assessed, this action is redundant but included to maintain the flow of the story.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Ross becomes healthy.

7. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in exam room B. Since Jones has not been assessed yet, this action is necessary to determine his symptoms.

8. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Assuming Jones has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment. Jones becomes healthy.

9. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room C. This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

10. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Assuming Young has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment. Young becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients (Ross, Jones, and Young) are healthy, and Hathaway has achieved their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking and admitting patients**: These actions are necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to exam rooms for assessment and treatment.
- **Assessing patients**: This is crucial to determine the symptoms of each patient, which informs the correct treatment.
- **Treating patients**: This is the final step to ensure that each patient receives the appropriate treatment for their condition, leading to their recovery.
