**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is currently experiencing "Unknown," this assessment will help identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming that Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This is a critical step to ensure Ross becomes healthy. If Ross does not have Flaze, this could lead to a mistake, but since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, this action is taken.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - Young is currently in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload but is necessary to ensure Young receives care.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This assessment will help Dr. Hathaway identify Young's symptoms, which are currently "Unknown."

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. This is essential for Young's recovery.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Jones, who is still in Admissions.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - This assessment will help Dr. Hathaway identify Jones's symptoms, which are currently "Unknown."

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever, Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This is the final step to ensure all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to assess and treat the patients based on their symptoms, which are initially unknown. The goal is to ensure that all patients (Ross, Young, and Jones) are healthy by the end of the story. The actions taken are necessary to identify symptoms and provide the correct treatment, thereby fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
