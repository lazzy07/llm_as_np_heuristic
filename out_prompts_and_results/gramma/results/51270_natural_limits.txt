The bandit, having just looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is at the market and the hero is also there, unaware of her true intentions. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market, where she can confront the hero.

Once at the market, the bandit attacks the hero, who is armed but believes he is safe. The bandit successfully kills the hero, who is not carrying a sword. With the hero dead, the bandit loots the hero's body, taking the merchant's sword and the hero's coin. Now, the bandit has the medicine, the sword, and the coins she desired.

The bandit then walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely store her loot in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest.
