Zoe, now safe aboard her spaceship, realizes that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano. Understanding that they are friends and that the Lizard is the guardian of the surface, Zoe decides to help. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and assist him, as she knows he is in danger.
   
2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** - This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, reinforcing their friendship and showing her intent to help.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action solidifies their bond and emphasizes their mutual goal of safety and health.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface, leading to a critical moment in the story.

5. **Zoe teleports back to the ship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the volcano erupts, but it also means she cannot save the Lizard.

6. **The Lizard dies.** - This is the tragic outcome of the story, as the Lizard, despite their friendship, cannot escape the eruption.

In this story, the actions taken by Zoe are focused on helping her friend, the Lizard, while also ensuring her own safety. The eruption of the volcano serves as a climactic event that leads to the Lizard's demise, highlighting the dangers of the planet and the fragility of their friendship in the face of such threats.
