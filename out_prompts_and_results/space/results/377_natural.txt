Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have established a friendship, which is crucial for their safety and mutual goals. 

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. Since she is not safe on the surface, she needs to return to the ship where she can be safe and healthy.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and to continue building their friendship. This action is important because it shows her commitment to the Lizard and their friendship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They both walk to the cave, which is a safe location away from the erupting volcano. This action is essential for both characters to remain safe and healthy.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in a safe location strengthens their bond and ensures they can work together to face any future challenges.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
