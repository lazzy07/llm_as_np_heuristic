In the current situation, Rory is in the Cave with Talia and Gargax, while Vince is in the Village. Rory has the Treasure, which contributes to his wealth, and he also has a relationship with Talia that has been accepted. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, Rory needs to ensure he has enough wealth and happiness.

The simplest action for Rory to take is to travel back to the Village with Talia, where they can both be happy together, and Rory can also secure his wealth by being with Talia, who has no money or treasure. 

Hereâ€™s the action Rory will take:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village with Talia. This action allows Rory to be in a location where he can be happy with Talia, and since he has the Treasure, he is wealthy.

This single action is sufficient for Rory to achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, as he will be with Talia, who has accepted his proposal.
