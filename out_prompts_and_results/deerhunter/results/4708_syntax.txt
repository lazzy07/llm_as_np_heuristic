To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is also greedy and wants money, he will need to go to the bank to get money from the bank clerk after eating.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will allow him to regain energy and focus on his next goal of getting money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to get money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
