To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is already at the Market, so she will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Guard.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is already at the Market, so he will walk to the Crossroads to meet the Merchant.

3. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom using the coin she has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without committing a crime.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to continue her business.
