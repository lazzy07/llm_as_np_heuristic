Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He goes back to the bank, where the clerk is still present. Since Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. 

Bubba enters the bank and points the rifle at the clerk, demanding the money. The clerk, believing that Bubba is alive and has the rifle, feels threatened and hands over the money to Bubba. Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money.
