To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is important to determine Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. Again, if Young has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both patients are treated correctly, thus achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Young to find out his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure he receives the right treatment.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment. This action is also essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

After these actions, both Ross and Young will be healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
