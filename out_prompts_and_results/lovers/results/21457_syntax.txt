To complete the story and ensure that Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the jewelry (I2). This is important because it informs Blake of Casey's desire, which is crucial for the next action.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey to facilitate the trade.

4. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I1) they have for the jewelry (I2) that Casey wants. This action is essential as it directly leads to Blake obtaining the item they want, thus making them happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12) to be with Blake after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps maintain the connection between the characters.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to Blake's location to facilitate communication.
- **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Casey informs Blake of their desire for the jewelry, which is crucial for the trade.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to Casey's location to complete the trade.
- **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R12)**: Blake trades chocolates for jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room, maintaining character interaction.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
