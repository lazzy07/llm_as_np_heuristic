Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can accurately assess them without the risk of making a mistake. After assessing Young, Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that they have Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, resulting in Young becoming healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting there. Hathaway assigns Jones to Patient Room C. After admitting Jones, Hathaway assesses him in Patient Room C and finds that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Jones healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross, who is also waiting. Hathaway assigns Ross to Patient Room B and assesses him, discovering that he has a rash as well. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, making him healthy too.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
