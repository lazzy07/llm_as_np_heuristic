To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave to confront Gargax, who is currently in the cave with Vince. This action is necessary because Rory needs to ensure that he can secure the treasure and money while also addressing his hunger.

2. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince, which eliminates one of the obstacles in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows Rory to take the money from Vince's body without any interference.

3. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

4. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with the money. This action is necessary for Rory to be in a safe location where he can enjoy his wealth.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry, which is a natural consequence of his actions and ensures that he is not hungry anymore after the next action.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax eats Rory, which is a twist in the story. However, since Rory has already achieved his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, this action does not negate his success.

In summary, Rory successfully becomes wealthy by taking the money from Vince after Gargax eliminates him. Although Rory ends up being eaten by Gargax, he achieves his goal of wealth and is not hungry at the time of his demise.
