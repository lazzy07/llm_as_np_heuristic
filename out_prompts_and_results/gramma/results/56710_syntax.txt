To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Guard, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Guard, taking the Guard's sword. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to eliminate the threat posed by the Guard, who is armed and could potentially kill the Bandit.

2. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: After the Bandit has successfully robbed the Guard, the Bandit will loot the Merchant's sword from her corpse. This action is necessary to ensure the Bandit is fully armed and can defend herself against any remaining threats.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the BanditCoin location and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins and fulfill the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit eliminates threats and secures her goal of accumulating coins.
