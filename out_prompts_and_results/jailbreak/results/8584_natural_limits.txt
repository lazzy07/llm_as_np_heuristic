**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym with Roy, and he needs to protect both himself and his friend. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to the gym where Roy is, as he needs to find a way to help him.)
   
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (By crawling through the vents, Ernest can avoid direct confrontation with the bully and reach Roy without being seen.)

3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Ernest and Roy a chance to confront him safely.)

Now, with the gym door locked, Ernest and Roy can strategize their next move against the bully. They can either overpower him together or find a way to escape. However, the story ends here with the tension of the locked door, leaving the outcome uncertain but giving them a fighting chance.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the hallway allows Ernest to get closer to Roy and the bully without being directly threatened.
- Crawling through the vents is a stealthy way to reach the gym, avoiding the bully's immediate threat.
- Locking the gym door secures their position and gives them control over the situation, allowing them to confront the bully without fear of him escaping.
