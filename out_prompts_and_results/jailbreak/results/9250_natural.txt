**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy realizes that the bully is in the gym and that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decides to take the following actions:

1. **Roy moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to retrieve the knife to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
2. **Roy steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This gives him a means to protect himself and Ernest from the bully.)
3. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (He needs to get closer to the gym where the bully is.)
4. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him safely.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now ensure that he and Ernest can live without fear of being threatened.
