To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that the Merchant is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without becoming a criminal, as the Merchant is not armed.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins secured in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

After these actions, the Bandit will have achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows the Bandit to acquire a coin from the Merchant, increasing her wealth without risking her status as a criminal since the Merchant is unarmed.
- The second action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, which is one of her goals.
