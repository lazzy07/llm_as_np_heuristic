The bandit, having just attacked the hero and feeling emboldened, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the merchant and the guard are still present. The bandit knows that the merchant has the medicine, which she can use to further her own goals. 

Upon arriving at the market, the bandit uses her sword to attack the merchant, who is unarmed and unable to defend herself. The bandit successfully kills the merchant and loots the medicine from her corpse. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit now has a valuable item that can be used for trade or leverage in the future.

The bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she can now return to the camp with the medicine, which can be traded for coins.
