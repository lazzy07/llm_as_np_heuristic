In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I1), which is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve this, Alex can take the following action:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the jewelry (I1) they want with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will also be happy.
- Blake remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills the requirement.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the action:
- The trade allows Alex to get what they want (the jewelry) while also giving Casey something they want (the flowers), which aligns with their mutual desire for each other's happiness.
