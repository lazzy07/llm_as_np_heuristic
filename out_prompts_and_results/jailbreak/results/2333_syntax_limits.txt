**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that Ernest is in the gym and that the bully is also there, threatening Ernest. To help his friend and ensure their safety, Roy moves to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside with Ernest. This action prevents the bully from threatening either of them further. With the bully locked away, Roy can now focus on escaping.
