To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit starts at the Cottage and walks to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit then walks to the Market, where she can find Tom and the Merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed, and takes the coin he has. This action helps the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to prepare for her next move.

5. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins she has acquired.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to successfully achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Cottage and needs to move to the Crossroads to access the Market.
- By walking to the Market, she positions herself to encounter Tom, who has a coin.
- The rob action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to take a coin from Tom without any risk since Tom is unarmed.
- Walking back to the Crossroads and then to the Bandit Camp ensures that the Bandit can safely store her newly acquired coin.
