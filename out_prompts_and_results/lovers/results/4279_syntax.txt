To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey (C3) trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up in the living room with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry to be happy, and trading allows them to obtain it directly.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still happy with the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) will now have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy if they want them.
- Casey (C3) will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.

This single action is sufficient for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
