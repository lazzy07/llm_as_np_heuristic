Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that her workload is too high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms. She decides to assess Ross first, who is in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to correctly identify Ross's condition and provide the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting there. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to.

4. **Admit and Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to an exam room (let's say Room A) and assesses him. She discovers that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones in Exam Room A**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is essential for ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Jones, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
