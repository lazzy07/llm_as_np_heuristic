To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to confront the clerk and take the money. Without this movement, he cannot achieve his goal.
  
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action is the direct way for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk, which is the only way for him to gain money in this scenario.

With these two actions, Bubba will successfully achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
