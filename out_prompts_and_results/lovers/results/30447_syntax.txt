To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items.

2. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves to the bedroom (R22) where Alex is located. This is important because Blake can help Alex by giving or trading items.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the bedroom (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamic.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
