To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial as it sets the foundation for cooperation and mutual safety.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface of the planet can start erupting at any time. This action introduces a sense of urgency and danger, prompting both characters to act quickly to ensure their safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the volcano. This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safe place and avoid the impending eruption.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe to the cave. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe location, reinforcing their friendship and mutual safety.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action highlights the importance of their previous decisions to move to a safer location.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also solidifying its friendship with Zoe.
