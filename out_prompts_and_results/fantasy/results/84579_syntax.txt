To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy (or both), we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged, and also on the treasure in the cave. The following actions will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to be with Talia. This is necessary because Talia is currently in the cave, and Rory needs to be there to help her achieve her goals.

2. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince also travels to the cave. This is important because Vince is a potential ally who can help Talia and Rory.

3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth.

4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

5. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's happiness or wealth but can be included for narrative flow.

6. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince also travels back to the village. Similar to Rory, this is for narrative flow.

By following these actions, Talia will become both happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel actions**: These are necessary to bring Rory and Vince to the cave where Talia is, allowing them to interact and achieve their goals.
- **Pickup action**: This is essential for Talia to gain wealth by acquiring the treasure.
- **Marry action**: This fulfills Talia's desire for happiness, as she is now married to Rory.
