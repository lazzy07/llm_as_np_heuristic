To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia is currently at the village and the treasure is at the cave, we need to facilitate Talia's access to the treasure. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** (This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and he can help Talia become wealthy by bringing the treasure back to the village.)
2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.** (This action allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which can then be used to make Talia wealthy.)

After these actions, Vince can return to the village with the treasure, and since Talia is married to Vince, she will share in the wealth, thus making her happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Vince travels from the village to the cave:** This action is essential for Vince to reach the treasure, which is the key to Talia's happiness and wealth.
- **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave:** By acquiring the treasure, Vince ensures that Talia will become wealthy, which directly contributes to her happiness.
