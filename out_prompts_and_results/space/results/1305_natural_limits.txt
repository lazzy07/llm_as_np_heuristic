Zoe, safe aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface is too dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She decides to reach out to the Lizard, who she believes is at the cave. To establish a connection and make a friend, Zoe teleports to the cave where the Lizard is located. 

Upon arriving at the cave, Zoe finds the Lizard and, instead of fighting, she extends a hand of friendship. The Lizard, who is also seeking companionship, accepts Zoe's offer. They both express their desire for safety and health, and they agree to work together to ensure their mutual well-being.
