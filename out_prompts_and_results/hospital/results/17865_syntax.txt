To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC with Jones, the first action is to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway needs to walk to PatientRoomA to assess Young. This is important to ensure that Young's condition is also evaluated, as he is another patient who needs treatment.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This completes the treatment for all patients.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating patients**: This is the final step to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.
