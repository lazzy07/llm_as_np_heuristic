**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess Jones and Ross to ensure they receive the correct treatment.)
2. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown. (Hathaway needs to determine Jones's condition to provide appropriate care.)
3. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C. (Hathaway needs to assign Ross to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and observes Unknown. (Hathaway needs to determine Ross's condition to provide appropriate care.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis with steroids. (Young has a rash, which indicates Jarkis, and Hathaway needs to treat Young to ensure they become healthy.)
6. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis with steroids. (Since Jones's condition is unknown, Hathaway mistakenly treats him for Jarkis, but this is necessary to ensure he receives care.)
7. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids. (Similarly, Ross's condition is unknown, and Hathaway mistakenly treats him for Jarkis, but this is necessary to ensure he receives care.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients to ensure they become healthy. The doctor first needs to assess the patients to understand their conditions, even if some conditions are unknown. The treatment actions are based on the symptoms observed, and while there are mistakes made due to the unknown conditions, the goal of treating all patients is still achieved.
