To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her marrying Rory, who has the treasure, and thus increasing her wealth. Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, as she has already proposed and Rory accepted. Marriage will solidify their relationship and make both characters happy.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Village)**: After the marriage, Talia can take the treasure from Rory. This action is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth, as Rory possesses the treasure.

3. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to confront Gargax, who is a potential threat due to his desire for wealth.

4. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story, but it does not affect Talia's happiness or wealth since she has already achieved her goals through marriage and acquiring the treasure.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Talia becomes happy through marriage.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Village)**: Talia becomes wealthy by acquiring the treasure.
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia moves to the cave, where Gargax is located.
- **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Talia is eaten by Gargax, which is a necessary event in the story but does not impact her previously achieved goals.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "marry(Rory, Talia, Village)",
    "pickup(Talia, Treasure, Village)",
    "travel(Talia, Village, Cave)",
    "eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence ensures Talia achieves her goals of happiness and wealth before the final event occurs.
