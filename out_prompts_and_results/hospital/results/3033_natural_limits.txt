Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their conditions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can manage the patients more effectively and reduce the number of patients in the admissions room.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently unknown. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has the rash symptom of Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This action ensures that Young becomes healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - After admitting Ross to Patient Room C, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, assuming he has the fever symptom of Flaze. This action ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Young and Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
