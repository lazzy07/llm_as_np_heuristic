In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Jones's symptoms is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, they will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If they have a rash, they will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room and is not part of the immediate focus on Jones's health, we will have Young walk to Exam Room C. This action is not directly related to Jones's health but helps to keep the story moving and allows for potential future interactions.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.
2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy, as it directly addresses their medical needs.
3. **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: This action helps to keep the narrative flowing and allows Young to be in a different room, potentially setting up for future interactions.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy while maintaining a coherent story structure.
