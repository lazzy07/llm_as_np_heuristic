To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory will travel back to the Village where Vince is located. This is necessary because Rory needs to propose marriage to Talia, and Talia is currently in the Cave. 

2. **propose(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory will propose marriage to Talia in the Village. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's previous proposal, this action will lead to both characters being happy.

This sequence of actions allows Rory to achieve happiness through marriage with Talia, while also ensuring that he remains wealthy by keeping the treasure he picked up in the Cave.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action is essential for Rory to reach Talia, as she is currently in the Cave. It sets up the next action where he can propose to her.
- **propose(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action is crucial for Rory to achieve happiness. Since Talia has already accepted his proposal, this will solidify their relationship and make both characters happy.
