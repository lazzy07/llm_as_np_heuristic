Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands in the market, where the merchant has just been killed. The guard is at the crossroads, unaware of the chaos in the market. The bandit, also armed, is present in the market, eyeing the situation.

To achieve his goal of getting the medicine, Tom decides to take a decisive action. He approaches the bandit, who is not carrying a sword, and robs her of the medicine. This action is possible because Tom is armed and the bandit is not. 

With the medicine now in his possession, Tom can confidently walk back to the cottage, fulfilling his goal.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Rob the bandit**: This action allows Tom to take the medicine from the bandit, which is his primary goal. Since the bandit is not armed, Tom can successfully rob her without facing any consequences.
