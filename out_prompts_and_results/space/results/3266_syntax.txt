To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the cave to the surface to confront Zoe. This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be in the same location as Zoe to interact with her and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Once the Lizard reaches the surface, it will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to stop fighting and start building a friendship, which is one of the Lizard's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave with the Lizard. This action signifies their newfound friendship and allows them to explore the cave together, ensuring both characters are safe from the erupting volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts after Zoe and the Lizard have moved to the cave, which is a safe location. This action is included to show the danger that was present on the surface, reinforcing the importance of their decision to move to the cave.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
