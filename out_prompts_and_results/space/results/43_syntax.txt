Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself in a cave on a planet where she has just teleported from her spaceship. The surface of the planet is dangerous due to a volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe is determined to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, who is also in the cave with her. 

To achieve her goal of friendship and safety, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard, ensuring that they are not fighting and can communicate openly.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they explore the surface together, which is now safe since they are friends. This action allows them to leave the cave and enjoy the planet together, reinforcing their new friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the surface, solidifying their bond and ensuring they are both safe together.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are no longer on the surface, they are safe. This event serves as a narrative climax, showing the danger they avoided by becoming friends.

By making peace first, Zoe ensures that she and the Lizard can work together to stay safe and enjoy their time on the planet, achieving her goal of friendship and safety.
