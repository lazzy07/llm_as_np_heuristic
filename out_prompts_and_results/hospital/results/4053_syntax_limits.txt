**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room B, where Ross is located. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, they can still assess and treat patients without making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to see Young, who is still waiting to be assigned to an exam room.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C, increasing their workload to 2 again, but allowing them to assess and treat Young in the future.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring he is healthy, and prepares to help Young next.
