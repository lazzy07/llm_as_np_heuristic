Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Then, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Again, Young's symptoms are unknown, but Hathaway is still able to assess him accurately.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze, believing he has a fever. Since Ross is actually healthy, this treatment is unnecessary, but it reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2. 

In this scenario, Dr. Hathaway has not achieved the goal of making all patients healthy, but he has ensured that all patients are assessed and treated, which is a step towards his goal.
