To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Talia is already married to Rory and is currently in the cave with the treasure, the best course of action is for Rory to travel to the cave, pick up the treasure, and then return to the village. This will allow Rory to become wealthy and maintain his happiness through his marriage to Talia.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels from the village to the cave to be with Talia and to access the treasure.
2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, which will make him wealthy.
3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with the treasure.

After these actions, Rory will be wealthy (having the treasure) and happy (being married to Talia), thus achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Rory to reach Talia and the treasure, which is located in the cave.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, fulfilling his desire to be wealthy.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action brings Rory back to the village, where he can enjoy his wealth and maintain his happiness.
