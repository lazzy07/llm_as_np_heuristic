**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them. 

1. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from accessing Roy and Ernest, ensuring their safety for the moment.)
   
With the gym door locked, Roy feels a sense of relief. He knows he needs to get to the highway to escape, but he also wants to ensure Ernest is safe. He crawls through the vents to reach the highway.

2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows Roy to escape the prison without being seen by the bully or the guards.)

Once on the highway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise.

3. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action is necessary for Roy to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.)

Now fully disguised, Roy makes his way to the edge of the highway, ready to escape.

4. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This action fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free, ensuring he is no longer threatened by the bully or the prison guards.)

Meanwhile, Ernest remains in the cell block, unaware of Roy's successful escape. However, Roy's actions have ensured that he is safe and alive, achieving his goal.
