To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, to ensure the story flows logically, we can include a few actions that reinforce the situation and conclude the story.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Bubba is hungry, and since he has just shot Bambi, he can eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger.
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger, but it also reinforces the fact that Bambi is no longer alive, which is already established.
3. **Bubba leaves the bank**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal but provides a sense of closure to the story.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is included because Bubba is hungry, and it makes sense for him to want to eat after having shot Bambi.
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and reinforces the consequences of his earlier actions. It also emphasizes that Bambi is no longer alive.
- **Bubba leaves the bank**: This action provides a sense of resolution to the story, indicating that Bubba is moving on after achieving his goal.

Since Bubba already has 1 money, he has achieved his goal without needing to take any further actions to acquire more money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat",
    "Bubba eats Bambi",
    "Bubba leaves the bank"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan reflects the necessary actions taken by Bubba to achieve his goal while also providing a logical flow to the story.
