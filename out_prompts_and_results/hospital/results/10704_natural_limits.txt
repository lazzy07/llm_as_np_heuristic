Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she prioritizes Jones's health. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. Treating him with antibiotics will ensure he becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Jones becomes healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition, as he is still in the admissions room and has an unknown symptom. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** Assuming Ross has a rash (the only other symptom that could be present), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross also becomes healthy.

Now, both Jones and Ross are healthy. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.** This action is necessary to determine Young's condition, as he is also in the admissions room with an unknown symptom. 

If Young is found to have a rash, Hathaway can treat him for Jarkis as well, ensuring all patients are healthy.

In summary, the actions taken are essential for Dr. Hathaway to achieve her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
