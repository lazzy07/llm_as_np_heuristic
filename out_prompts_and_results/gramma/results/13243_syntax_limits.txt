In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The Merchant is currently at the Cottage with the Medicine, while the Bandit is also at the Cottage. The Bandit has coins in her chest and is a criminal, which poses a risk to the Merchant. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Cottage to the Crossroads. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to leave the Cottage, where the Bandit is present, and move to a safer location where she can potentially interact with Tom or the Guard.

After this action, the Merchant is at the Crossroads, away from the Bandit, and can now consider her next steps to acquire coins without engaging in criminal activity.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant's action of walking to the Crossroads is essential to avoid the Bandit and to position herself for future opportunities to acquire coins without breaking the law.
