To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is greedy and hungry, which influences his actions. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to want the clerk's money, and he has the means (the loaded rifle) to do so.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and return to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it aligns with his need to satisfy his hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger and make use of the resources available to him.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money and satisfying his hunger.
