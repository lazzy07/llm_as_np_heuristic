2. **The bandit attacks the merchant and kills her.**  
   - The bandit needs to eliminate the merchant to take the hero's coin, which the merchant is currently carrying. Since the merchant is not armed, the bandit can successfully attack.

5. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit needs to return to her camp to secure her coins and avoid being caught by the guard.

6. **The bandit places the coin in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit has successfully stored her coins, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the merchant. By attacking and killing the merchant, she eliminates a potential threat and gains access to the coin. Looting the coin from the merchant's corpse directly fulfills her goal of acquiring coins. The guard's action of reporting the bandit does not hinder her since she has already secured her goal. Finally, the bandit returns to her camp to store the coin, completing her objective.
