To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can access the chest containing her coins.

2. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The story is short because the bandit only needs to return to her camp and collect the coins to fulfill her objective. The other characters do not interfere with her actions, and the bandit successfully achieves her goal without any conflict.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
