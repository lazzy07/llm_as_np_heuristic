Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, decides to take action. He is at the bank, where he has already stolen a rifle from the bank clerk. Since he is hungry, he needs to eat to regain his strength. He knows that Bambi, the deer, is in the forest, and he believes that he can hunt her for food. 

To achieve his goal of satisfying his hunger, Bubba goes to the forest where Bambi is located. Once there, he uses his rifle to shoot Bambi, killing her. He then eats her, fulfilling his hunger.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba moves to the forest where Bambi is located to hunt her.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi, killing her.
3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, satisfying his hunger.

Each action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of eating and fulfilling his hunger.
