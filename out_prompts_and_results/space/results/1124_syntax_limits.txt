Zoe, having just made peace with the Lizard, realizes that the surface of the planet is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. She decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, she knows that the Lizard is still on the surface and in danger. 

To help the Lizard, Zoe teleports back to the surface, despite the risks. She quickly walks to the Lizard, who is still in the cave, and urges him to come with her to safety. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions and feeling a bond of friendship forming, agrees to follow her. 

As they both make their way back to the spaceship, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava flows across the surface. Zoe manages to teleport back to the ship just in time, but the Lizard, unable to escape the eruption, is caught in the lava and dies. 

In the end, Zoe mourns the loss of her new friend but cherishes the brief connection they had, realizing that they had made a friendship before the tragic event.
