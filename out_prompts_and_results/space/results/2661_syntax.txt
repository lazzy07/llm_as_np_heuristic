To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe is currently in the cave, and the Lizard is on the surface. Since they are not fighting, Zoe can attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe can walk to the surface where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to physically be in the same location as the Lizard to solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe reaches the surface, she can again make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters are safe and healthy.
