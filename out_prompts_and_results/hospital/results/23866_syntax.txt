To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Since Jones is in PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial for the same reason as assessing Jones.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is currently in Admissions. This will complete the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is the final step to ensure all patients are healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions taken and their explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition and decide on the correct treatment.
2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and decide on the correct treatment.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's condition and decide on the correct treatment.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to treat Jones based on the assessment, ensuring he becomes healthy.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to treat Ross based on the assessment, ensuring he becomes healthy.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to treat Young based on the assessment, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
