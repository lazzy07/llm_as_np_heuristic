To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. This is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Admissions to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

6. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This is the final step to ensure that all patients are healthy.
