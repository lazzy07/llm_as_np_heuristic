The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the guard is present. The bandit reports her own location to the guard, knowing that this will distract him from her true intentions. While the guard is focused on the bandit, she quickly loots the coins from the merchant's chest, which she had previously hidden at the bandit camp. With the coins now in her possession, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
