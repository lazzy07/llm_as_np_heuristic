**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking it will help with Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now realizing the mistake, walks to Admissions to admit Young, who is still waiting.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, where Ross is currently located.

5. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking it will help with Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

8. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit the last patient, Young.

9. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.

10. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young.

11. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

12. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, thinking it will help with Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions lead to the unfortunate demise of all patients due to her high workload causing her to misdiagnose each one. However, she has completed her goal of assessing and treating all patients, albeit with tragic outcomes.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing each patient is necessary to determine their condition, even though the high workload leads to misdiagnosis.
- Treating each patient is essential to attempt to make them healthy, which is Dr. Hathaway's ultimate goal.
