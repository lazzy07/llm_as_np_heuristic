To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake is currently in the dining room (R11) and wants to make Alex happy. Alex wants item I1 (the jewelry).**
2. **Casey is in the living room (R12) and has item I1 (the jewelry).**
3. **Blake can tell Casey that Alex wants item I1 (the jewelry) to encourage Casey to give it to Alex.**

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R11).** This action is necessary because it influences Casey's decision to give the jewelry to Alex.
   
   - Action: `tell(B, C, I1, R11)`

2. **Casey, believing Blake, moves to the dining room (R11) to give the jewelry to Alex.** This is necessary for Casey to be able to give the item to Alex.
   
   - Action: `move(C, R12, R11)`

3. **Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R11).** This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.
   
   - Action: `give(C, I1, A, R11)`

4. **Blake is now happy because Alex has received the item they wanted.** 

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.
- Casey moves to the dining room.
- Casey gives the jewelry to Alex.

This sequence ensures that Blake achieves their goal of being happy by making Alex happy.
