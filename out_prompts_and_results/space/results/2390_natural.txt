Zoe and the Lizard are currently in the cave, having made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. However, the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, and they need to address this situation.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and ensure that the Lizard, as the guardian, is aware of the danger. This action is necessary to confront the erupting volcano.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is triggered as Zoe is on the surface, fulfilling the condition that the volcano can erupt at any time. This action leads to the next critical event.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This is the consequence of Zoe being on the surface when the volcano erupts. It fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - After the eruption, the Lizard, as the guardian, comes to the surface to assess the aftermath and ensure safety.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe (in spirit).** - Although Zoe has died, the Lizard reflects on their friendship and the bond they formed, symbolically making peace with Zoe's memory.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard acknowledges their friendship, thus achieving the goal of making friends.
