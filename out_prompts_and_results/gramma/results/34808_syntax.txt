To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Camp, leaving Tom and the Merchant at the Crossroads. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to secure her coins in the chest at the Camp, which will allow the Merchant to take advantage of the situation.

2. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk to the Market. This action is necessary for the Merchant to be in a location where she can sell her items and potentially acquire more coins.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom will also walk to the Market. This action is necessary for Tom to be in a position to interact with the Merchant and potentially buy the medicine back.

4. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, TomCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the TomCoin from Tom using the coin she has. This action is necessary for the Merchant to gain a coin without committing a crime.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for her to return to a location where she can interact with Tom again.

6. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the Medicine from Tom using the coin she just acquired. This action is necessary for the Merchant to sell the Medicine later for more coins.

7. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Camp to secure her items and coins. This action is necessary for her to finalize her transactions and ensure her safety.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant successfully acquires coins without becoming a criminal, achieving her goal.
