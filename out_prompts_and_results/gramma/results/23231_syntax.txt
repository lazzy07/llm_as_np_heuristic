To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Merchant, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk to the Cottage to deliver the medicine to Tom. This is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk to the Crossroads to meet the Merchant. This is necessary for Tom to receive the medicine.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Cottage with Tom. This is necessary for Tom to have the medicine in his possession at the Cottage.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk back to the Cottage with the medicine. This completes Tom's goal of being at the Cottage carrying the medicine.

The actions are structured to ensure that Tom receives the medicine from the Merchant and returns to the Cottage, where he can achieve his goal.
