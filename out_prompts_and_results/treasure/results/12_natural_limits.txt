Hawkins and Silver arrive at the island, both eager to find the treasure. Hawkins, knowing that Silver is a pirate and might try to take the treasure for himself, quickly suggests they work together to dig it up. Silver, believing that the treasure is indeed buried on the island, agrees to the plan. They both start digging, and after a short while, they uncover the treasure chest.
