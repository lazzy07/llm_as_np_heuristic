Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is still on the surface and is unaware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. To ensure both her safety and the Lizard's, she decides to make peace with the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship and encourage the Lizard to join her in the cave, away from the danger.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe reaches out to the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe while fostering a friendship.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard agrees to follow Zoe into the cave, where they will be safe from the volcano. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters are in a safe location together.

With these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making a friend in the Lizard.
