To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomB with Jones, they can assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated appropriately.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can admit Young to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms (which is antibiotics for Flaze). This is the key action that ensures Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms (which is also antibiotics for Flaze). This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms (which is steroids for Jarkis). This ensures that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following this sequence of actions, all patients will be treated correctly, and Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
