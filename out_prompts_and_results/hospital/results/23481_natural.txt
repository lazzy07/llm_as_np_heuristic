**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients quickly, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking it will help with Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now aware of the urgency, walks to Admissions to assess Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing her workload again.

5. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, further increasing her workload.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking it will help with Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

8. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

9. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, thinking it will help with Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones, Ross, and Young, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at assessing and treating her patients, which aligns with her goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy. However, due to her high workload, she made mistakes in diagnosing the diseases.
