To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market, where she can potentially interact with Tom and the Merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, taking the coin he has just acquired from the Merchant. This action is possible because Tom is not armed.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp, increasing her total coins.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk to the Crossroads and then to the Market to continue her business.

5. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, using her own coins. This action allows her to acquire more coins without becoming a criminal.

6. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads, where he can then head to the Cottage with the medicine.

7. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads, ensuring she is still in a position to conduct business.

8. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads, maintaining his position to monitor for criminals.

9. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will also walk to the Crossroads, positioning herself to potentially interact with the other characters.

10. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is targeted as a criminal.

11. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, killing her since she is a criminal and unarmed.

12. **loot(Guard, BanditSword, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard will loot the Banditâ€™s sword from her corpse, ensuring he is armed.

13. **loot(Guard, BanditCoin, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard will also loot the coins from the Bandit, further increasing his own wealth.

14. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk to the Cottage, carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant successfully acquires coins while the Bandit is dealt with by the Guard, fulfilling the Merchant's goal without her becoming a criminal.
