**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess Ross and Young, who are currently in Admissions.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C. (This allows Hathaway to assess and treat Ross.)
3. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C and observes Unknown symptoms. (Hathaway needs to determine what Ross is experiencing.)
4. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids. (Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway takes a risk and treats him for Jarkis, which is the only other disease.)
5. Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess Young next.)
6. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A. (This allows Hathaway to assess and treat Young.)
7. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A and observes Unknown symptoms. (Hathaway needs to determine what Young is experiencing.)
8. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. (Again, Hathaway takes a risk and treats him for Jarkis.)
9. Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room B. (Hathaway needs to check on Jones.)
10. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics. (Since Jones has a fever, Hathaway correctly treats him for Flaze.)
