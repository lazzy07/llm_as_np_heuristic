To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village where Talia is located. This is necessary because Rory needs to be with Talia to fulfill their relationship and achieve happiness.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: After marrying Talia, Rory can now travel back to the Cave to pick up the Treasure. This is essential for Rory to achieve wealth.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Rory is not currently satisfied, but it does not affect the overall goal since Rory's wealth and happiness have been achieved.

5. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the Cave to retrieve the Treasure.

6. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the Treasure, which will increase their wealth.
