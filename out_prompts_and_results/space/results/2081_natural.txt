Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially help the Lizard. She knows that the Lizard is at the surface and is not safe, so she teleports back to the surface to confront the Lizard.

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and assess the situation on the surface.)
   
Upon arriving at the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard struggling with the eruptions. Instead of attacking, she decides to communicate and offer help.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which aligns with both of their goals of making friends and being safe.)

The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, agrees to work together. They both realize that they need to escape the danger of the erupting volcano.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** (This action is necessary for both characters to find safety from the eruptions.)

As they reach the cave, the volcano erupts violently, but they are safe inside. They both express gratitude for each other's help, solidifying their newfound friendship.

4. **The volcano erupts.** (This event is included to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting, while also ensuring that both characters are safe inside the cave.)

In the end, Zoe and the Lizard have successfully made friends and avoided the danger of the eruption.
