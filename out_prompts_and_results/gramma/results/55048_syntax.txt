To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit will walk from the crossroads to the camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the bandit prefers to be at the camp and needs to ensure the coins are safely stored there.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible.
