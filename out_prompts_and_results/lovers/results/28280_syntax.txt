To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I1).
- Blake is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2).
- Casey is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
