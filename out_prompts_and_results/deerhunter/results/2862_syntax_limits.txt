To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is hungry and greedy, will decide to shoot Bambi. This action serves two purposes: it allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi (if he chooses to do so later) and it also fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

2. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will still be motivated by greed and will decide to go back to the bank to get the money from the bank clerk. This action is necessary to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome. Bubba will have the opportunity to either take the money from the bank clerk after shooting Bambi or simply have Bambi dead, fulfilling the conditions of the story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is crucial as it eliminates Bambi, satisfying the condition of Bambi being dead. It also aligns with Bubba's hunger and greed, as he may want to eat Bambi later.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action ensures that Bubba's greed is addressed, allowing him to pursue the money from the bank clerk after dealing with Bambi.
