**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing an unknown condition, Dr. Hathaway's workload remains at 2, and there is no risk of making a mistake. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, successfully curing Young of Jarkis.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Since both are still in Admissions, Dr. Hathaway can assess them without increasing the workload.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Ross. Dr. Hathaway finds that Ross also has a fever, indicating that Ross has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing Ross of Flaze.
