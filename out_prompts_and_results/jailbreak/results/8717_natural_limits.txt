**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, still in the hallway, realized the danger they were in with the bully threatening both him and Ernest. He knew he had to act quickly. He decided to sneak into the kitchen to grab the knife, which could help him defend himself and Ernest against the bully.

Roy moved stealthily into the kitchen, retrieved the knife, and then made his way back to the hallway. He knew that the bully was still in the gym, and he had to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them. 

Once in the hallway, Roy locked the gym door, ensuring the bully was trapped inside. With the knife in hand, he felt more secure. He then put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself. 

Now disguised, Roy crawled through the vents to the highway, where he could escape from the prison. He successfully made it outside, leaving the prison behind and achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
