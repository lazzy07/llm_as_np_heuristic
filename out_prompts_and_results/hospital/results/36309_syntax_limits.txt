To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway can assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Hathaway assesses Jones and finds that he has a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway can then treat him with antibiotics. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway can assess Ross, who is also in the admissions room. This will allow Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that both patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Jones**: This action is crucial to determine the specific disease Jones has, which is necessary for effective treatment.
- **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: This action directly addresses Jones's health issue, ensuring he recovers if he has Flaze.
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is also evaluated for any symptoms he may have, allowing Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.
