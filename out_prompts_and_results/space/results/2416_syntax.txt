To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters achieve their goals while also leading to a conclusion where the volcano erupts, resulting in one character dying, and the other character making friends. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to attack the Lizard, believing that this will help her assert herself and possibly lead to a resolution. This action is necessary to create a conflict that can lead to a resolution later.

2. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: The Lizard, in response to Zoe's attack, stuns her. This action is crucial as it allows the Lizard to gain the upper hand in the fight and creates a moment of vulnerability for Zoe.

3. **break_free(Zoe, Cave)**: Zoe manages to break free from being stunned. This action is important as it allows her to regain control of the situation and continue interacting with the Lizard.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the brief fight, Zoe and the Lizard realize that they both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. They decide to make peace. This action is essential as it fulfills their mutual goal of friendship.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a predetermined event that leads to the conclusion of the story. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting.

6. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption causes the Lizard to be killed, as it is on the surface when the volcano erupts. This action is the final outcome of the story, leading to the death of one character.

In summary, the actions taken lead to a fight that ultimately resolves in friendship, but the eruption of the volcano results in the Lizard's death. This fulfills the requirements of the story while ensuring that both characters' goals are addressed.
