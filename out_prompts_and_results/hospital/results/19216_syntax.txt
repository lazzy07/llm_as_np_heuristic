To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway should first admit Ross to an exam room (let's say Exam Room B) and then assess him to determine his symptoms.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: This action will allow Hathaway to increase their workload by one, but it is necessary to ensure Ross is treated.

3. **Assess Ross**: After admitting Ross, Hathaway will assess him to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. This is crucial to ensure the correct treatment is administered.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway should then admit Young to an exam room (let's say Exam Room C) and assess him to determine his symptoms.

6. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action will allow Hathaway to increase their workload by one, but it is necessary to ensure Young is treated.

7. **Assess Young**: After admitting Young, Hathaway will assess him to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

8. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both Ross and Young, ensuring that all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Necessary to allow Hathaway to assess and treat Ross.
- **Assess Ross**: To determine the correct treatment for Ross's symptoms.
- **Treat Ross**: To ensure Ross becomes healthy based on the assessment.
- **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Necessary to allow Hathaway to assess and treat Young.
- **Assess Young**: To determine the correct treatment for Young's symptoms.
- **Treat Young**: To ensure Young becomes healthy based on the assessment.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, TreatmentB, PatientRoomB)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, TreatmentC, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, "SymptomB" and "TreatmentB" would correspond to the actual symptoms and treatments for Ross, and "SymptomC" and "TreatmentC" would correspond to those for Young, ensuring that Hathaway successfully treats both patients.
