To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in the same room as the characters, and we need to find a way to get it to Blake.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to check for the chocolates (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to find the item they want to help Blake.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item they want to give to Blake.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) with the chocolates.
   - This action is necessary to bring the chocolates back to where Blake is located.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake.
   - This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want, making Blake happy.

5. **put_down(C2, I3, R22)**: Blake puts down the flowers (I3) they were holding.
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but is included to show that Blake is now focused on the chocolates.

6. **put_down(C3, I2, R22)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room.
   - This action is included to show that the chocolates are now with Blake.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates they wanted.
