To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to initiate contact with the Lizard, who is currently on the surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks to the cave, leaving Zoe alone on the surface. This action is included to create a moment where Zoe can think about her next move without the Lizard being present.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and attempt to establish a friendship.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action ensures that Zoe is safe and healthy, as she is now away from the dangerous surface.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
