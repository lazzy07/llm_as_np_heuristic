3. **Zoe and the Lizard discuss the dangers of the surface.** This conversation helps both characters understand each other's perspectives and reinforces their friendship.

4. **Zoe invites the Lizard to join her on the spaceship.** This action ensures that both characters can be safe and healthy away from the erupting surface.

5. **Zoe teleports with the Lizard to the spaceship.** This final action secures their safety and allows them to continue their friendship in a safe environment.
