**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to help Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy sneaks back through the vent to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and protect Ernest.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door behind him.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he cannot threaten Ernest while Roy deals with him.)
3. **Roy grabs the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for Roy to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)
4. **Roy confronts the bully and kills him with the knife.** (This action removes the immediate danger to both himself and Ernest, allowing them both to be safe.)
5. **Roy then returns to the hallway and crawls back through the vent to the highway.** (This allows him to escape the prison without being caught.)
6. **Finally, Roy escapes from the prison while wearing the civilian clothes.** (This is the ultimate goal, ensuring his freedom.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Sneaking back to the gym allows Roy to confront the bully directly, which is crucial since the bully poses a threat to both him and Ernest.
