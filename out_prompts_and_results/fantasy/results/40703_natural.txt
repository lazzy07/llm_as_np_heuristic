To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave, and she is married to both Rory and Vince. However, Rory is dead, and Vince is alive. Vince has the money, and Talia has no wealth or treasure. Gargax, the dragon, is also at the cave and is hungry.

Here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and Talia is at the cave. By eating Talia, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and Talia will no longer be alive, which will allow her to become happy in the afterlife, as she will no longer be burdened by her current state of unhappiness.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body.** - After eating Talia, Gargax can take the treasure from Rory's body. This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy, and by taking the treasure, he will achieve that goal.

3. **Vince travels to the cave.** - Vince, who is alive and has the money, will travel to the cave to confront Gargax. This action is necessary for the story to progress towards a resolution.

4. **Gargax proposes to Vince.** - Gargax, now wealthy with the treasure, can propose to Vince. This action is necessary because it allows Gargax to form a bond with Vince, who is also alive.

5. **Vince accepts Gargax's proposal.** - Vince accepts Gargax's proposal, which makes both characters happy. This action is necessary to ensure that both Gargax and Vince achieve their happiness.

6. **Gargax and Vince get married.** - This final action solidifies the bond between Gargax and Vince, ensuring that both characters are happy.

In this sequence of actions, Talia becomes happy in the afterlife after being eaten by Gargax, and Gargax achieves his goal of wealth by taking the treasure. Vince also becomes happy through his marriage to Gargax.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Talia",
    "Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body",
    "Vince travels to the cave",
    "Gargax proposes to Vince",
    "Vince accepts Gargax's proposal",
    "Gargax and Vince get married"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia's happiness is achieved, while also allowing Gargax to become wealthy and Vince to find happiness through his relationship with Gargax.
