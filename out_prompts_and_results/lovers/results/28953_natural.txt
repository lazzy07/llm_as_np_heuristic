**Story Completion:**

1. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Casey to access the jewelry, which is in the living room.

2. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

3. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's goal but allows Casey to be in a different room after obtaining the jewelry.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up. The second action is the key step that allows Casey to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry. The third action is optional but provides a sense of movement and closure to the scene.
