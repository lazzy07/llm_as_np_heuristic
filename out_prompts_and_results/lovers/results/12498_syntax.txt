1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where Alex is located (R22) to facilitate a trade or give the item.
2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in R22. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to have an item, which may help in future trades or actions.
3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to R22 to be in the same room as Blake and Alex, where they can interact.
4. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they received from Blake for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This is the crucial action that allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
