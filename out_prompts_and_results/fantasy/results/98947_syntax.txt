To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, but she is not happy. She has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which means she has the potential to marry either of them. 

To achieve her goal, Talia should marry one of the suitors, which will increase her happiness. Since she has already accepted both proposals, she can choose to marry either Rory or Vince. However, marrying Rory will not help her wealth since he is not wealthy, while marrying Vince will keep her wealth intact. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince, which makes her happy. This is crucial because Talia's happiness is currently at 0, and marriage will increase it.
2. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave to be with Talia after their marriage. This action is necessary to ensure they are together after the marriage.
3. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry, which is a necessary action to set up the next event.
4. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is necessary because it removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince without the complication of Rory's presence.

After these actions, Talia will be married to Vince, which will make her happy, and she will still possess the treasure, ensuring her wealth.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)",
    "travel(Vince, Village, Cave)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: This action is essential for Talia to achieve happiness, as marriage to Vince fulfills her relationship goal.
- **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: This action ensures that Vince is present with Talia after their marriage, reinforcing their relationship.
- **get_hungry(Rory)**: This action is necessary to set up the next event where Gargax can eat Rory, removing him from the story.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action eliminates Rory, allowing Talia to focus on her marriage with Vince without any competition for her affections. 

By following this sequence, Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy.
