To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is also present and has money. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk because he is greedy and wants the money. The rifle is loaded, and the clerk is a target that Bubba believes is alive. This action will result in the clerk being dead, and Bubba will then be able to take the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills Bubba's greed and ensures he has the money.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money and the bank clerk being dead, which satisfies the conditions of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money. Since Bubba is greedy, he will take this action to achieve his goal.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money, fulfilling his greed and achieving the story's goal.
