To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey is holding. This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy, and trading is a way to obtain it without needing to move to another room.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what they want, but they are not the focus of this story.
- Blake remains in the same position, but their happiness is not the goal here.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want by giving away the chocolates they received from Casey. This directly leads to Alex's happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
