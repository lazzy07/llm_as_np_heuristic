To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I2). This is a strategic move to inform Alex of their desire, which may prompt Alex to act in a way that helps Blake.

3. **give(C1, I2, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. Since Alex wants Casey to be happy and believes that giving the jewelry to Blake will help achieve that, this action aligns with their goals.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) after receiving the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way for Blake to enjoy their happiness in a different space.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry (I2) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
