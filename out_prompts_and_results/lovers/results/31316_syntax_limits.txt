In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I3 (which is in the same room, R22), and they are currently not happy. Casey (C3) has item I1, which Alex does not want, and Blake (C2) wants item I2, which is currently unknown to Alex. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up item I3 from the room they are in (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for item I3, making them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the item they want (I3) from the room they are currently in (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they have obtained the item they desire.

After this action, the situation will be:

- at(C1) = R22
- at(C2) = R22
- at(C3) = R22
- at(I1) = R22
- at(I2) = ?
- at(I3) = R22
- happy(C1) = True (Alex is now happy)
- happy(C2) = False
- happy(C3) = False
- wants(C1) = I3
- wants(C2) = I2
- wants(C3) = I3

Now, Alex is happy, achieving their goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, with only one action necessary for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
