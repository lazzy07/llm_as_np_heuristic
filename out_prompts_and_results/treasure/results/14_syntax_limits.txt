After Hawkins spread the rumor about the treasure being buried on the island, both he and Silver sailed to the island. Once they arrived, Hawkins dug up the treasure, revealing it to both of them. However, Silver, believing that the treasure was rightfully his due to his pirate nature, quickly took the treasure for himself.

In this story, the only action taken is `take(Silver, Treasure)`. This action is necessary because it allows Silver to achieve his goal of obtaining the treasure after it has been dug up by Hawkins.
