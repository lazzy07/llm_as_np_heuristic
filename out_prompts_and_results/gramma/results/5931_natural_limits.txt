Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the market, where the merchant has just been killed. The guard is also present, but he is unaware of Tom's criminal status. The bandit, also armed, is eyeing the situation. 

To achieve his goal of getting the medicine, Tom decides to loot the merchant's corpse. This action is necessary because the merchant is the only character who has the medicine, and since she is dead, Tom can take it without further conflict.

Tom quickly approaches the merchant's body and retrieves the medicine. With the medicine in hand, he feels a sense of accomplishment and heads back to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Loot the merchant's corpse:** This action allows Tom to obtain the medicine directly from the merchant, who is now dead. It is the only way for him to achieve his goal without further conflict or risk of being attacked by the guard or the bandit.
