**Story Completion:**

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (Ernest needs to find the knife to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
2. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This gives Ernest a means to protect himself and Roy from the bully.)
3. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (Ernest needs to get closer to Roy to strategize against the bully.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from easily accessing Roy and gives Ernest a chance to confront the bully.)
5. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (Ernest needs to confront the bully directly to ensure their safety.)
6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to escape.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that either Ernest or Roy can overcome the bully's threats. The first few actions focus on gathering the necessary tools (the knife) and positioning (locking the gym door) to confront the bully. The final action is decisive, as it removes the immediate threat, allowing for a potential escape.
