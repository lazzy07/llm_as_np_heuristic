After Hawkins spreads the rumor about the treasure being on the island, he and Silver sail to the island together. Once they arrive, Hawkins digs up the treasure, and since Silver believes the treasure is on the island, he can take it.

However, to ensure Silver achieves his goal, Hawkins must allow Silver to take the treasure after it has been dug up. Therefore, the final actions will be:

1. **dig()** - Hawkins digs up the treasure, which is necessary for Silver to take it.
2. **take(Silver, Treasure)** - Silver takes the treasure, achieving his goal.

This sequence of actions ensures that Silver successfully obtains the treasure while still allowing Hawkins to play a role in the story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["dig()", "take(Silver, Treasure)"]
}
