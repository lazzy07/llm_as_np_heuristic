To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is currently assigned to PatientRoomC, this action is valid and necessary to identify the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If he shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross, who is showing symptoms of SymptomA. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Ross.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Ross and confirming he has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is appropriate for the disease, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

With these actions, Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
