**Story Completion:**

As Roy is on the highway, he realizes that he needs to help Ernest, who is still in the cells and threatened by the bully. Roy decides to sneak back into the prison through the vent to confront the bully. He crawls through the vent and emerges in the gym, where the bully is still occupied with his workout. 

Roy quickly assesses the situation and sees the knife lying on a table in the kitchen, which is just adjacent to the gym. He knows he needs to get that knife to protect himself and Ernest. 

Roy sneaks into the kitchen, grabs the knife, and then returns to the gym. With the knife in hand, he confronts the bully. In a swift move, Roy takes revenge and kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now focus on escaping with Ernest. He locks the gym door to secure their safety and then heads back to the hallway to find Ernest.
