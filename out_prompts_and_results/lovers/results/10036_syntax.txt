To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a position to pick up the chocolates, which are currently in the dining room.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This action is essential as it allows Blake to have the item they want, which is necessary for the next step.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Alex and Casey are. This is important so that Blake can interact with them and facilitate the trade.

4. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates for the jewelry with Casey. This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, which is what they want to be happy.

5. **put_down(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey puts down the jewelry in the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to clarify that Casey now possesses the jewelry.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have obtained the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
