To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Given the current situation, the volcano is about to erupt, which poses a significant danger to both characters. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship, which will keep her safe, and then she can return to the surface to continue building a friendship with the Lizard.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the impending eruption. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe's goal is to be safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface. This action is important for her to continue her efforts to befriend the Lizard.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard can now make peace since they are both on the surface and not fighting. This action is crucial for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is now safe on the spaceship, she is not harmed. This action is included to show the consequence of the earlier danger, but it does not affect Zoe's goal since she is safe.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
