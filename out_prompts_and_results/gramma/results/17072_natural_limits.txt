Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads with the merchant. The merchant, armed and aware of the bandit's potential presence, decides to take a risk. She offers Tom a deal: if he gives her the medicine, she will give him the hero's coin she has. Tom, wanting to ensure he has the coin to protect himself in the future, agrees. 

The merchant hands over the coin to Tom, and in exchange, he gives her the medicine. With this transaction, Tom now has the coin he desires, and the merchant has the medicine she can sell later.

Tom, now satisfied with his new coin, walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
