To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's body.**  
   - This action is necessary because Rory needs to acquire wealth, and since Vince is dead, Rory can take the money that Vince had.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the village where Talia is, as they are married and being together will contribute to Rory's happiness.

3. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Although they are already married, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that Rory's happiness is maximized.

4. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary to complete the marriage proposal cycle, ensuring both characters are happy.

5. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship, contributing to Rory's happiness.

At this point, Rory has achieved their goal of being happy, wealthy (having taken the money), and not hungry (as they are not described as hungry in the current situation).
