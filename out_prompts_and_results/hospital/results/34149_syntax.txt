To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Since Young is already assigned to PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Jones in PatientRoomB. This is important to determine Jones's symptoms and ensure they receive the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is currently in Admissions. This is crucial to identify Ross's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment based on the assessment results.
