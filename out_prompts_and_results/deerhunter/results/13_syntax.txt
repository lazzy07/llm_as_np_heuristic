To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, he will need to go to the bank where the clerk is located. Since Bubba is already in possession of a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the bank clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba leaves the house where he picked up the rifle and ammunition and heads to the bank to confront the clerk. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the clerk. This action is taken to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk and to ensure that he can take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is the culmination of his goal to obtain money.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Bubba to achieve his goal of getting money, as it involves directly confronting the clerk and taking the money after neutralizing any potential threat.
