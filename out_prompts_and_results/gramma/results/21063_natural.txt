The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. Since the hero is dead and the merchant is armed, the bandit will focus on robbing the merchant to obtain the hero's coin.

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** This action is taken because the bandit wants to acquire coins, and the merchant is not armed, making her an easy target. The bandit successfully takes the hero's coin from the merchant.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the stolen coin in the chest at the bandit camp, thus achieving her goal of having coins in her possession.

At this point, the bandit has successfully robbed the merchant and returned to the bandit camp with the coin, fulfilling her objective.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the merchant:** This is the primary action that allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins. The merchant is the only character with coins available, and since she is not armed, the bandit can easily take the coin without facing any consequences.
- **Walking to the bandit camp:** This action is essential for the bandit to store the stolen coin safely, ensuring that she has achieved her goal of having coins in her possession.
