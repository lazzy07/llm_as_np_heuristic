To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential target for food, which might help alleviate Bubba's hunger.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - Since Bubba is hungry, he needs to eat. Shooting Bambi allows him to obtain food. This action is crucial for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is a prerequisite for him to think clearly about his next steps.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.**  
   - After killing Bambi, Bubba decides to eat the deer. This action is necessary for Bubba to regain energy and possibly think about his next move regarding the money.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank, where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk. This action directly achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba first satisfies his hunger by eating Bambi, which allows him to think clearly and return to the bank to confront the clerk for the money.
