To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where the flowers are located (R22). This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to show that Alex is returning to a central location.

4. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21). This action is included to show Alex's movement through the house.

5. **move(C1, R21, R11)**: Alex moves to the living room (R11). This action is included to show Alex's movement through the house.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters' happiness is not a concern for this specific ending.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "move(C1, R12, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R11)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While not necessary for happiness, it shows Alex's movement back to a central location.
- **move(C1, R12, R21)**: This action continues to show Alex's movement through the house.
- **move(C1, R21, R11)**: This action continues to show Alex's movement through the house. 

The focus is on Alex achieving happiness by obtaining the flowers, which is the primary goal.
