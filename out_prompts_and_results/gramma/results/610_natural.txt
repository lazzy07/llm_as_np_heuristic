**Story Completion:**

1. **The hero (Tom) reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is necessary because Tom needs to ensure the bandit is dealt with, allowing him to safely retrieve the medicine from the merchant.

2. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - The guard, being armed and wanting to kill criminals, will act on the information provided by Tom. This eliminates the immediate threat posed by the bandit.

3. **The guard loots the banditâ€™s corpse.**  
   - After killing the bandit, the guard can take the hero's coin from the bandit, which is essential for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

4. **The guard gives the medicine to Tom.**  
   - The guard, having no personal interest in the medicine, can hand it over to Tom, fulfilling Tom's goal of carrying the medicine.

5. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom can now safely walk back to the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is strategically chosen to ensure Tom can safely obtain the medicine and return to the cottage. Reporting the bandit is crucial for Tom's safety, while the guard's actions ensure the bandit is eliminated. Looting the bandit allows Tom to have the necessary coin, and giving the medicine to Tom ensures he can fulfill his goal. The final action of walking back to the cottage completes Tom's objective.
