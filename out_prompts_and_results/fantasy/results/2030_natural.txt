To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because it removes Talia from the story, allowing Rory to focus on his own happiness and wealth without the complication of Talia's presence. Since Talia is married to Rory, her death will not affect his happiness negatively, as he is already married to her.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Gargax to become wealthy, which aligns with his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave**: Gargax will travel to the cave to access the treasure, which will further increase his wealth.

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure**: This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, fulfilling his desire for wealth.

5. **Rory proposes to Gargax**: This action is necessary for Rory to secure a partnership with Gargax, who now has wealth. By proposing, Rory can ensure that he will benefit from Gargax's newfound wealth.

6. **Gargax accepts Rory's proposal**: This action allows Rory to be happy through the acceptance of his proposal, as it creates a bond between them.

7. **Rory and Gargax get married**: This final action solidifies Rory's happiness through marriage, and since Gargax is now wealthy, Rory's goal of being wealthy is also achieved.

The sequence of actions leads to Rory achieving his goals of happiness and wealth while ensuring he is not hungry.
