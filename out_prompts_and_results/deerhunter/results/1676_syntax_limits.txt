To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action will result in the clerk being dead, and Bubba will then be able to take the money from the clerk.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling his greed.
