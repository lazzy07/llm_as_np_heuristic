To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit then walks to the market, where she can find Tom and the merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed. This allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her wealth.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit walks back to the crossroads.
