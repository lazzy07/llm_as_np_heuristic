To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Jones in the same room. This will help to identify Jones's symptoms as well, ensuring that both patients are evaluated.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, and it will make Ross healthy.

5. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Jones is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and it will make Jones healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is also diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy too.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
