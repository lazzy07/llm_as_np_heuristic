To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the bedroom (R12) to the dining room (R21) where they believe the jewelry is located. This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **put_down(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I3) back in the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but can be seen as a way to keep the item safe or to prepare for a potential trade or gift later.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) to be closer to Alex, who is currently in that room. This action helps facilitate communication or potential item exchanges.

5. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C2) in the living room (R22). This action is crucial as it allows Casey to ensure that Alex is happy, which is part of Casey's goal of making Blake happy.

6. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12) to retrieve the chocolates (I2) for Blake. This action is necessary for Alex to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy.

7. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C1) in the bedroom (R12). This action ensures that Blake is happy, which in turn makes Casey happy.

By following these actions, Casey achieves their goal of happiness by ensuring that Alex and Blake are also happy, creating a chain of happiness among the characters.
