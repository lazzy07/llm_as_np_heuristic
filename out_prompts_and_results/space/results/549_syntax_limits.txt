Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, and they need to act quickly.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to assess the situation from above and ensure that she can return to the surface if needed. However, this action will make the Lizard angry, which could jeopardize their newfound friendship.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface**: After assessing the situation, Zoe realizes she needs to be on the surface to help the Lizard. This action will further anger the Lizard, but it is essential for her to be present during the eruption.

3. **The volcano erupts**: This action is inevitable as the volcano has already begun to erupt. Since Zoe is on the surface, she will be caught in the eruption, leading to her demise.

Through these actions, Zoe's decision to teleport back to the surface ultimately leads to her death, while the Lizard remains safe in the cave. Despite the tragic outcome, the story highlights the importance of friendship and the risks involved in exploration.
