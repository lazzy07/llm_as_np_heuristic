To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying the medicine. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin that Tom has, which is essential for her goal of accumulating coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her loot in a safe location.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has the maximum amount of coins possible, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the most critical action for the Bandit to achieve her goal of accumulating coins. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can successfully take the coin without any risk.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to ensure the Bandit can secure her stolen coin and any other coins she may have in a safe place.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action allows the Bandit to maximize her coin collection, which is her primary objective.
