To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to move to a location where he can potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with his rifle. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, achieving the desired outcome.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and take the money. This is the primary action that fulfills Bubba's greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba needs to leave the bank after stealing the money, and the forest is the next logical location where he can encounter Bambi.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is killed, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
