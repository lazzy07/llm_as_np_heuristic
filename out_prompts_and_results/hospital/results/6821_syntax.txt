To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A and Ross is assigned there, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can walk to Exam Room B to assess Jones. This is important to determine Jones's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room C to assess Young. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
