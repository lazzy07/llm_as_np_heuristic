The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market with the medicine. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is likely to be distracted, the bandit decides to attack the hero. 

The bandit approaches Tom and attacks him, successfully killing him. She then loots the medicine from Tom's corpse, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she can now also take the hero's coin.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the hero**: The bandit attacks Tom because he is not armed and is an easy target. This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate a non-criminal and take the medicine.
2. **Loot the medicine**: After killing Tom, the bandit loots the medicine from his corpse, which fulfills her goal of carrying valuable items.

The bandit now has the medicine and can return to the bandit camp with her spoils.
