Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. She mistakenly believes that Ross is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis due to her high workload. After the assessment, she treats Ross with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, Ross does not have Jarkis but instead has Flaze, which means the treatment is incorrect. However, since Ross is alive and healthy, he survives the treatment error.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to an exam room. She assigns Jones to Patient Room B, which is currently unoccupied. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B, where she correctly identifies that Jones is experiencing symptoms of Flaze. She treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

In the end, Ross is alive and healthy, achieving his goal.
