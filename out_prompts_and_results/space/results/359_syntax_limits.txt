In this story, Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is in a cave. They have made peace with each other, but the surface of the planet is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the imminent eruption of a volcano. 

To complete the story, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action will initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to fulfill the condition of the volcano erupting, which is one of the possible endings.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will teleport back to the surface to witness the eruption. This action is important because it allows Zoe to be present during the eruption, which is crucial for the next action.

3. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard, feeling threatened by the eruption and possibly mistaking Zoe's presence as a danger, will attack and kill Zoe. This action leads to Zoe's death, fulfilling the condition of a character dying.

After these actions, the story concludes with the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard remaining safe in the cave. The Lizard, having acted out of fear, may later reflect on the situation and realize the importance of friendship, but that is left open-ended.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to trigger the volcanic eruption, which is a key event in the story.
- **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe needs to be on the surface to interact with the environment and the Lizard during the eruption.
- **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: This action results in Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story.
