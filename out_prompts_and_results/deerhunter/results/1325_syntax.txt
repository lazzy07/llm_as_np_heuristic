To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest after having shot and eaten Bambi. He is aware that the bank clerk has money, and he believes the clerk is still alive. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Go from Forest to Bank**: Bubba needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located to obtain the money.
2. **Steal from Clerk**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle, which allows him to threaten the clerk.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is. Without going to the bank, he cannot interact with the clerk or obtain the money.
  
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully intimidate the clerk into giving up the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have achieved his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
