To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface. This action is crucial because it places Zoe in the dangerous area where the eruption will occur.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: This action is included to ensure that despite the circumstances, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendship before the eruption takes place. However, since Zoe is on the surface when the eruption occurs, she will not survive.

The final sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard and Zoe have made peace, establishing a friendship.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **begin_erupt**: Starts the eruption process, creating a dangerous situation.
- **walk**: Moves Zoe to the surface, where the danger is imminent.
- **erupt**: Executes the eruption, leading to Zoe's demise.
- **make_peace**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their goal of making friends.
