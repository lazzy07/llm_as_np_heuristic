**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the hallway, he knows he must act quickly to help his friend Ernest. He decides to crawl through the vents to the gym, where he believes Ernest is being threatened by the bully. Once in the gym, Roy sees the bully looming over Ernest, ready to strike. 

Roy, still disguised in civilian clothes, takes a deep breath and locks the gym door behind him, ensuring they won't be interrupted. He then pulls out the knife he had hidden in his clothes and confronts the bully. In a swift motion, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, freeing both himself and Ernest from the threat.
