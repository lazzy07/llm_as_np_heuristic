Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, is currently at Patient Room A with Jones, who is experiencing Fever. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat another patient. 

To ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment for his Fever, Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, which is the appropriate treatment for Flaze. This action will reduce Hathaway's workload by one, bringing it down to 2, which is safe for further actions.

Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Ross, who is currently experiencing Unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now manageable, they can assess Ross without the risk of making a mistake. 

After assessing Ross, if he shows any symptoms of Fever, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If he shows a rash, Hathaway will treat him with steroids for Jarkis. However, since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the symptoms observed.

Finally, Hathaway will walk to Admissions again to assess Young, who is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. The same process will apply: Hathaway will assess Young and treat him accordingly based on the symptoms.

This sequence of actions ensures that both Jones and Ross are treated correctly, leading to their health and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
