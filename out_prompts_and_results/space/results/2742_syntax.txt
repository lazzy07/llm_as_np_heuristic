Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous. They have already made peace with each other, which is a crucial step towards achieving their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends. To ensure their safety, Zoe needs to get both herself and the Lizard to a safer location.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard has just been. This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the dangers of the surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are in the same safe location.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, leaving the Lizard in the cave. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her own safety, as the surface is dangerous.

5. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Cave)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship to join Zoe. This action ensures that both characters are now safe on the spaceship.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe, while also making a friend in the Lizard.
