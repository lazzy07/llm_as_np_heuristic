**Story Completion:**

As the tension in the gym escalated, Ernest and Roy exchanged worried glances. The bully, towering over them, was clearly agitated by the loss of his cigarettes. Knowing they had to act quickly, Roy decided to take a risk. He remembered the knife in the kitchen and thought it could be their only chance to turn the tables.

**Action 1:** Roy sneaks out of the gym and crawls through the vents to the kitchen to retrieve the knife.  
*Explanation:* This action is necessary for Roy to obtain a weapon that could help them defend themselves against the bully's threats.

**Action 2:** Roy returns to the gym with the knife and, in a moment of desperation, he confronts the bully and kills him.  
*Explanation:* This action allows Roy to eliminate the immediate threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Ernest can survive without fear of being killed.

With the bully dead, Roy and Ernest are left in the gym, shaken but alive. They know they must find a way to escape the prison before the guards discover what happened.
