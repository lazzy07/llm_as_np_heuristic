In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy. The flowers are currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the flowers from Casey. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the item they have (the jewelry, I3) with Casey for the flowers (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will also be happy if they wanted it.

This single action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
