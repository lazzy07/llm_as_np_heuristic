In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Casey achieve their goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the other characters to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to receive an item from Blake, which may help in making Blake happy, fulfilling Casey's desire to make Blake happy.

3. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Blake for the flowers (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to give an item to Alex, which may help in making Alex happy, thus indirectly helping Blake as well.

4. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Finally, Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Blake. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to fulfill Blake's desire for the flowers, making both Casey and Blake happy.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have made Blake happy, and Blake will also be happy because they received the flowers.
