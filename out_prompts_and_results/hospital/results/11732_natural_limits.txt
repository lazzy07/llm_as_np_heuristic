Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is actually healthy, he recovers from his unknown condition. 

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room C. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway treats him with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Ross recovers as well.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
