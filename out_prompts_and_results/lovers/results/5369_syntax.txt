To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Casey (C3) tells Blake (C2) that they want the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21)**. This is a strategic lie because Casey actually wants the jewelry (I3). By doing this, Casey hopes to manipulate Blake into thinking they need to trade items.

2. **Blake (C2) picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21)**. This action is necessary for Blake to have the item that Casey has just claimed to want.

3. **Blake (C2) moves to the bathroom (R22)**. This movement is required for Blake to be in a position to trade items with Casey.

4. **Blake (C2) gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the bathroom (R22)**. This action allows Casey to receive the item that they pretended to want, which will help in the next step.

5. **Casey (C3) gives the chocolates (I2) back to Blake (C2) in the bathroom (R22)**. This action is a part of the trade process, allowing Casey to now have the opportunity to receive the jewelry.

6. **Blake (C2) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the bathroom (R22)**. This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
