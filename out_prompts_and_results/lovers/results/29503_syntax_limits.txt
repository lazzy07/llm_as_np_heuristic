To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Since the current situation indicates that I2 is not in the same room as Blake, we need to facilitate a way for Blake to acquire it.

Here's the shortest story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential for Casey to have the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Blake is located. This action is necessary to bring the jewelry to Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have received the item they wanted.
