**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Casey gives the flowers to Alex:** This is the first and crucial action that directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy. Since Alex is currently in the living room with Casey, this action is possible and necessary for Alex to achieve their goal.

- **Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room:** This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness. Since the chocolates are in the dining room and Blake is in the living room, this action is not directly connected to the previous action but is essential for Blake's happiness.
