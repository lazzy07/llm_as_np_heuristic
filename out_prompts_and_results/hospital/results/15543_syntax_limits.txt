In the current situation, Young is in Patient Room B, and Hathaway is also in Patient Room B. Young has a symptom of SymptomB, which is not yet identified. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine their symptoms and then treat them accordingly.

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B to identify their symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway realizes that Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis (the rash). Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Young becoming healthy.

With these two actions, Young successfully achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.
