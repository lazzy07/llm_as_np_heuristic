To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory and the treasure in the cave. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, they can get married, which will make both of them happy. Additionally, Rory can travel to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which will make Talia wealthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action will make Talia happy because she is now married to Rory, fulfilling her desire for happiness.
2. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which is necessary for Talia to become wealthy.
3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure, which will contribute to Talia's wealth.
4. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the treasure.
5. **give(Rory, Talia, Treasure, Village)**: Rory gives the treasure to Talia, making her wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness.
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to go to the cave to get the treasure.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory collects the treasure, which is essential for Talia's wealth.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the treasure.
- **give(Rory, Talia, Treasure, Village)**: This action ensures Talia becomes wealthy.
