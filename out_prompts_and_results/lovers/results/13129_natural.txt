To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, we can outline the following actions:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.** 
   - This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, which is currently with Alex. Since they are in the same room (the dining room), Casey can pick it up.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and by giving them to Alex, Casey can ensure that Alex becomes happy. This also helps to create a positive dynamic between the characters.

3. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey and Alex, allowing for further interactions.
