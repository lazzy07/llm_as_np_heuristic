To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and he is hungry and greedy. The bank clerk has money, and Bubba has a loaded rifle, which gives him the ability to steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat, as he is hungry. This action is included to show that Bubba is addressing his hunger after achieving his goal.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will then go to the forest, where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to find food.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will shoot Bambi to eat her. This action is included to fulfill Bubba's hunger after he has stolen the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba steals money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger after getting the money.
- **go**: Bubba moves to the forest to find food.
- **shoot**: Bubba kills Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
