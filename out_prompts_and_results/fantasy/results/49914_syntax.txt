To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she currently has no wealth.

2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia marries Rory. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

3. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Vince is not hungry and has money. Since Talia has now married Rory and is happy, she does not need to take any further actions regarding Vince. However, this action is not necessary for Talia's goal but is included to show that Vince is still alive and has money.

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by picking up the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup**: This action is crucial for Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her primary goals.
- **marry**: This action fulfills Talia's need for happiness, as she is now in a committed relationship with Rory.
- **take**: While this action does not directly contribute to Talia's goals, it shows the state of the other characters and their possessions.
