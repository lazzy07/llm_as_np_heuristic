**Story Completion:**

Alex is in the dining room, wanting the flowers that are with Casey in the living room. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to call out to Casey.

"Casey, could you please give me the flowers?" Alex asks from the dining room.

Casey, hearing Alex's request and wanting to help, moves from the living room to the dining room and hands the flowers to Alex.

Now, Alex has the flowers and is happy.

1. **Alex calls out to Casey**: This action is necessary for Alex to communicate their desire for the flowers, as they cannot move to the living room to get them directly.
2. **Casey moves to the dining room and gives the flowers to Alex**: This action allows Casey to fulfill Alex's request, ensuring that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers.
