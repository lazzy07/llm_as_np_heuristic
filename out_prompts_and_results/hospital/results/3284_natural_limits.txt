Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, is currently in Patient Room A with Jones, who is experiencing a fever. Since Jones has a fever, he is suffering from Flaze, which requires antibiotics for treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently at 2, so he can safely treat Jones without making a mistake.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, and treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy. 

After treating Jones, he becomes healthy, which is a success for Dr. Hathaway.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Ross, who is still in the admissions room, is assigned to an exam room for further assessment and treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which are currently unknown. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment.** If Ross shows any symptoms that indicate Flaze or Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway will treat him accordingly, ensuring that he also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Jones and Ross, achieving his goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
