**Story Completion:**

Blake looks at the jewelry in the living room and realizes that Alex wants it. Blake decides to help Alex by giving the jewelry to Casey, who also wants it. 

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry from the living room.** (This action is necessary for Blake to have the jewelry to give away.)
2. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.** (This action helps Casey achieve their goal of being happy with the jewelry.)
3. **Blake moves to the dining room.** (This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's goal but allows for a transition to a new space after helping Casey.)

After these actions, Blake is happy because they helped Alex and Casey achieve their goals, and they now have the chocolates.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Pick up the jewelry:** Blake needs to have the jewelry in order to give it to Casey, who wants it.
- **Give the jewelry to Casey:** This directly helps Casey achieve their goal of happiness, as they wanted the jewelry.
- **Move to the dining room:** While this action does not directly contribute to Blake's happiness, it signifies a transition after helping others, which aligns with Blake's desire to help Alex and Casey.
