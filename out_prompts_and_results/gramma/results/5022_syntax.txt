To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in a location where she can sell items and interact with Tom, who has coins.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, Merchant, Tom)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, giving him the opportunity to sell it and gain a coin in return. This action allows the Merchant to increase her coin count without engaging in criminal activity.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads, leaving the Merchant in the Market.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk to the Crossroads, where she can potentially interact with Tom and the Merchant.

5. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit’s location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is targeted and potentially removed from the Market, which helps the Merchant feel safer and allows her to continue her business without fear of robbery.

6. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report.

7. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, eliminating her as a threat in the Market and allowing the Merchant to operate freely.

8. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit’s coins, adding to her total without engaging in criminal activity.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins while maintaining her status as a non-criminal.
