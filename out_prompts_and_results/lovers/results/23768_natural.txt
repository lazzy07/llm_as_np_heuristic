To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give the flowers to Alex.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers, which is what Alex wants to be happy.

3. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not directly related to Alex's goal but is necessary for Blake to eventually find the chocolates, which Blake wants.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the chocolates, fulfilling Blake's desire for happiness.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy, while Blake has the chocolates and is also happy. Casey is left with the jewelry, which is not relevant to Alex's goal but is a necessary part of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Casey moving to the living room** is essential for the transfer of flowers to occur.
- **Casey giving the flowers to Alex** directly fulfills Alex's desire, making Alex happy.
- **Blake moving to the dining room and picking up the chocolates** ensures that Blake can also achieve happiness, which is a secondary goal in the context of the story.
