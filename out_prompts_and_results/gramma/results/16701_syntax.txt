To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is at the Crossroads and will move to the Market. This action is necessary to keep the Bandit away from Tom, as the Bandit is a criminal and could pose a threat.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is at the Market and will move to the Crossroads. This action is included to ensure that the Merchant is not in the way of Tom's goal and to keep the story progressing.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard is at the Market and will also move to the Crossroads. This action is included to ensure that the Guard is present to potentially deal with the Bandit later.

5. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads. This action is included to show that the Bandit is still active in the story, but it does not affect Tom's goal since he has already reached the Cottage.

6. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage again, ensuring he is at the Cottage with the medicine.

At this point, Tom is at the Cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is crucial as it directly moves Tom to the Cottage with the medicine.
- The subsequent actions involving the Bandit, Merchant, and Guard are included to maintain the narrative flow and ensure that Tom's path remains clear of threats, even though they do not directly impact Tom's goal.
