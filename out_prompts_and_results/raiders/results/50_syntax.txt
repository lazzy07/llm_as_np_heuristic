To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the story will focus on their actions after they have obtained the Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis already opened the Ark and became immortal, so they will take actions to secure their position and eliminate any threats.

### Story Completion:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, USA)**: The Nazis, now armed and immortal, will take the Ark from the US Army by force. This action is necessary to ensure that the US Army does not have access to the Ark, which could threaten the Nazis' newfound immortality.

2. **travel(Nazis, USA, Tanis)**: After securing the Ark, the Nazis will travel back to Tanis. This action is important as it allows them to return to the location where they can further solidify their power and possibly hide the Ark from any future threats.

3. **dig(Nazis, Ark, Tanis)**: The Nazis will dig up the Ark again in Tanis to ensure it is safely hidden and under their control. This action reinforces their ownership and prevents anyone else from accessing the Ark.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action of taking the Ark from the US Army is crucial because it eliminates the possibility of the US Army using the Ark against the Nazis. 
- The second action of traveling back to Tanis allows the Nazis to regroup and plan their next steps in a secure location.
- The final action of digging up the Ark ensures that the Nazis maintain control over the Ark and can use it as leverage or a weapon in the future.
