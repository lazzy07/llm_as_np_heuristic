To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface, especially since the surface is currently dangerous. This action helps the Lizard to ensure its safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are in a safe location together.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can reaffirm their friendship in a safe environment. This action solidifies their bond and ensures that both characters feel secure.

5. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt. This action is included to show the danger of the surface and the importance of the characters being in the cave.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, confirming the danger of the surface. This action emphasizes the necessity of the characters being in the cave for their safety.
