To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they believe that I3 is with Casey. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they want from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is the key to their happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have I3 (the chocolates).
- Casey will have I1 (the jewelry).
- Alex will be happy because they have the item they want.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Alex to get the chocolates they want from Casey, which directly leads to Alex's happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates they desire.
