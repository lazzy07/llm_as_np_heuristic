To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the same location as the bandit, who has the medicine that the merchant previously sold.

2. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant ensures that the guard will take action against the bandit, which will lead to the bandit's defeat and allow the merchant to loot the bandit's items without becoming a criminal.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to arrive at the crossroads to confront the bandit based on the merchant's report.

4. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit, allowing the merchant to safely collect the bandit's coins and the medicine without any criminal implications.

5. **The merchant loots the bandit's items from the corpse.**  
   - The merchant collects the bandit's coins and the medicine, achieving her goal of acquiring more coins.

This sequence of actions ensures that the merchant maximizes her coin collection while adhering to her moral code.
