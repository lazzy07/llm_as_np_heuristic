Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both desires. He aims the rifle at the bank clerk, who is standing in front of him with the money. Bubba, with the loaded rifle, steals the money from the clerk. 

This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money without needing to shoot the clerk, which would complicate the story unnecessarily. 

After stealing the money, Bubba now has what he wanted, and the story concludes with him having the money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["shoot the clerk", "steal the money"]
}
``` 

In this case, the action of stealing the money is the only necessary action to achieve the goal of Bubba having the money. The story is kept concise by avoiding unnecessary actions or complications.
