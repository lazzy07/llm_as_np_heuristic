**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A. Young is currently in Patient Room A, but Dr. Hathaway is unaware of Young's symptoms. To ensure Young's health, Young decides to take action.

1. **Young walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Young to be assessed by Dr. Hathaway, as Young needs to be in the same room as the doctor to receive treatment.

2. **Young walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.**  
   - Young needs to be in the correct room where Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat them. This movement is essential to ensure that Young is in the right place for the next step.

3. **Young walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.**  
   - Young returns to Patient Room A, where Dr. Hathaway is located, to ensure they can be assessed and treated.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Given that Dr. Hathaway's workload is still 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Young's goal is to be treated.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms (which could be a fever indicating Flaze), this treatment will ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Young successfully achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Young is aimed at getting assessed and treated by Dr. Hathaway, which is essential for Young's health.
- The movements between rooms are necessary to align Young with Dr. Hathaway for assessment and treatment.
- The assessment and treatment actions are critical to ensure Young's health is restored.
