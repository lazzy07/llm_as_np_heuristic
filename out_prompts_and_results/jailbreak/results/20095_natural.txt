**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows that the bully is a threat and that they need to escape the prison. 

1. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.**  
   - This action allows Roy to leave the prison without being detected by the guards or the bully, as he is already disguised.

2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes on the highway.**  
   - Although he is already wearing the civilian clothes, this action reinforces his disguise as he prepares to escape.

3. **Roy escapes from the prison.**  
   - This is the final action that allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free, away from the threats of the bully and the prison.

Meanwhile, Ernest remains in the kitchen, unaware of Roy's actions. He holds onto the cigarettes, but his primary concern is his safety. However, since Roy has successfully escaped, Ernest's fate is left uncertain, but Roy has achieved his goal of survival.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Crawling through the vents to the highway** is necessary for Roy to avoid confrontation with the bully and guards, allowing him to escape.
- **Putting on the civilian clothes** is redundant since he is already disguised, but it emphasizes his readiness to leave.
- **Escaping from the prison** is the ultimate goal for Roy, ensuring his survival and freedom.
