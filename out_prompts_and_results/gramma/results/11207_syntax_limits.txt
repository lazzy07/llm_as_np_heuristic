Tom is at the Crossroads, armed with a sword, and he sees the Bandit also at the Crossroads. Knowing that the Bandit is a criminal and poses a threat, Tom decides to take action to ensure he can safely carry the medicine back to the cottage. 

Tom attacks the Bandit, using his sword to eliminate the threat. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of safely carrying the medicine back to the cottage without the risk of being robbed or harmed by the Bandit.

After successfully attacking the Bandit, Tom can now loot the Bandit's belongings, which includes the coins that the Bandit has. This will provide Tom with the means to buy the medicine from the Merchant, ensuring he can fulfill his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

Finally, Tom walks back to the Merchant to acquire the medicine, completing his objective.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **attack(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)** - Tom eliminates the Bandit, removing the threat.
2. **loot(Tom, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)** - Tom takes the coins from the Bandit.
3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Merchant)** - Tom walks to the Merchant to buy the medicine.
4. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)** - Tom buys the medicine with the coins he looted.

Now, Tom can walk back to the cottage with the medicine.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "attack(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)",

    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Merchant)",
    "buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)",
    "walk(Tom, Merchant, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine while effectively dealing with the Bandit threat.
