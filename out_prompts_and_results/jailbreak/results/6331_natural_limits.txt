**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decided to take a risk. He quickly grabbed the knife from the kitchen, knowing it was his only chance to defend himself and Roy. With the knife in hand, he moved cautiously through the hallway towards the gym, where the bully was still enjoying his recreation time.

Once at the gym, Ernest locked the door behind him, ensuring they wouldn't be interrupted. The bully, surprised to see Ernest armed, laughed menacingly, but Ernest was determined. In a swift motion, he lunged at the bully, using the knife to get revenge for the threats against him and Roy. The bully, caught off guard, fell to the ground, and Ernest stood over him, breathing heavily, knowing he had finally overcome the threat.

With the bully incapacitated, Ernest quickly changed into the civilian clothes he had seen in the laundry room earlier. He then crawled through the vents to the highway, where he could finally escape the prison and leave the threats behind.
