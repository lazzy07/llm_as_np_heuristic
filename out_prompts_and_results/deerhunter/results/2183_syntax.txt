To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a loaded rifle. He is also greedy and wants money. Bambi is also in the forest, alive, and poses a potential target for Bubba.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, being greedy and hungry, will decide to shoot Bambi. This action will result in Bambi being dead, which satisfies one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba, still greedy, will decide to get money. Since he has already stolen the rifle from the bank clerk, he is motivated to continue his pursuit of wealth.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having Bambi dead, and he has also satisfied his hunger. The story ends with Bubba having the money (from the bank) and Bambi being dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is necessary to eliminate Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action reinforces Bubba's greed and desire for money, ensuring he remains focused on his goal.
