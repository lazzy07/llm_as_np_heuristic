1. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action is taken to initiate a conversation and show a willingness to cooperate, rather than retreating to the spaceship, which would anger the Lizard and escalate the situation.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendship, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to be healthy and safe and to make friends with other creatures.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since both characters are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship together.** - This action is taken to ensure their safety from the eruption, as they can now work together to find a way to avoid danger in the future.

In this story, the actions taken lead to a peaceful resolution between Zoe and the Lizard, allowing them to escape the erupting volcano together, thus achieving the goal of making friends while also ensuring their safety.
