To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom arrives at the cottage carrying the medicine.**  
   - This completes Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

The story is very straightforward because Tom's only goal is to reach the cottage with the medicine he purchased. The other characters' actions are not relevant to Tom's goal, so they are not included in the story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully achieves his goal with the minimum number of actions.
