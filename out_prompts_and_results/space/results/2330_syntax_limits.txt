Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangerous environment around them. They have already made peace, establishing a friendly relationship. However, the surface is still perilous, and both characters want to ensure their safety and health.

To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, which is a safe haven away from the dangers of the surface. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they have already established a friendship, which allows for understanding and acceptance of Zoe's need for safety.

**Action:**
1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)** - This action is taken by Zoe to ensure her safety and health by returning to the spaceship, which is a secure location away from the dangers of the surface.

After this action, Zoe is safe on her spaceship, and the Lizard remains on the surface, but they have established a friendship that allows for future interactions.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The teleportation action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being healthy and safe. Since the surface is dangerous, returning to the spaceship is the most logical step for her safety. The established friendship with the Lizard means that this action does not lead to conflict, allowing both characters to maintain their goals.
