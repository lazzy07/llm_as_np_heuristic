To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he is hungry. He also believes that the bank clerk is alive and has money. Bambi is also in the forest, and since Bubba is hungry, he may consider eating Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, being hungry and having a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi, fulfilling his hunger and also leading to Bambi's death.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and ensures that Bambi is dead.

This sequence of actions results in Bubba being no longer hungry and Bambi being dead, achieving the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and has a loaded rifle. Shooting Bambi allows him to fulfill his hunger and eliminates Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
  
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After successfully shooting Bambi, this action allows Bubba to eat the deer, satisfying his hunger and ensuring that Bambi is dead.
