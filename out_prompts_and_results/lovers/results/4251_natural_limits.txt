In the current situation, Alex is in the dining room and wants the flowers, which are with Blake in the living room. To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to get the flowers from Blake. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (This action is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates, and it allows Casey to be happy later.)
2. **Casey moves to the living room.** (This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake, where the flowers are.)
3. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.** (This action is necessary because it incentivizes Blake to give the flowers to Casey.)
4. **Blake gives the flowers to Casey.** (This action is necessary because Casey now has the chocolates, and Blake is willing to trade the flowers for them.)
5. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.** (This action is necessary for Alex to finally receive the flowers and achieve happiness.)

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making Alex happy.
