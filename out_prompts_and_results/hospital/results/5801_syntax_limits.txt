**Story Completion:**

After walking into Exam Room C, Ross waits for Dr. Hathaway to assess him. Hathaway, already in Exam Room C, decides to assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Ross's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

With the treatment administered successfully, Ross is now healthy and has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The assessment is essential to identify the disease correctly. Since Hathaway's workload is low (1), there is no risk of misdiagnosis.
- The treatment is necessary to ensure Ross recovers from his illness, which aligns with both Hathaway's and Ross's goals.
