To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will reflect the characters' goals of being healthy and safe, as well as making friends.

1. **Zoe walks to the Cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends. The surface is dangerous due to the volcano beginning to erupt, so moving to the cave is a safer option.

2. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since Zoe is now in the same location as the Lizard, they can make peace. This action solidifies their friendship and aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

3. **Erupt the volcano**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying. Since Zoe is now in the cave with the Lizard, she is safe, but the eruption will affect the surface.

4. **Lizard dies**: The eruption kills the Lizard, which is the character that remains on the surface. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

The sequence of actions ensures that both characters achieve their goals of friendship while also leading to the eruption of the volcano and the death of the Lizard.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe moves to the cave to interact with the Lizard, which is essential for making peace.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action triggers the volcano eruption, which is a critical plot point leading to the next action.
- **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption results in the Lizard's death, completing the story's requirements. 

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome while adhering to the constraints of the story.
