To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to be able to access the jewelry.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential as it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **put_down(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but can be included to show that Casey has the item and is satisfied with it.

4. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R12). This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but can be included to show Casey's return to a common area.

5. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to check on Casey. This action is included to show Blake's concern for Casey's happiness.

6. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R21). This action is included to show Blake's support for Casey's happiness.

Now, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
