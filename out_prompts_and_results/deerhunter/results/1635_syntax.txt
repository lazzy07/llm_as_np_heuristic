1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to get money from the bank. He needs to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest to ensure he is away from the bank and the clerk.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Since Bubba is hungry, he will decide to eat. This action is not directly related to his goal of obtaining money but is necessary for his survival.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and allows him to survive after obtaining the money.
