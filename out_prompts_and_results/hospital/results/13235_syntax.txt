To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross in PatientRoomA**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, this action is necessary to ensure he is also treated.

6. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
