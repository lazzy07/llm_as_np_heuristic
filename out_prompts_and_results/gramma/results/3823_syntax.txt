To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant takes the medicine from the Merchant's location (Camp) to the Bandit Camp.** This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be at the Bandit Camp to sell the medicine to the Bandit, who is likely to have coins.

2. **Bandit buys the medicine from the Merchant using coins from the chest.** This action allows the Merchant to gain coins without committing a crime, as she is selling an item rather than robbing or attacking anyone.

3. **Merchant walks back to the Market.** This action is necessary for the Merchant to return to her preferred location after completing the transaction.

4. **Merchant walks to the Crossroads.** This action is necessary for the Merchant to move towards the Market again.

5. **Merchant walks back to the Market.** This action finalizes the Merchant's return to her preferred location.

By following these actions, the Merchant successfully sells the medicine and acquires coins without engaging in criminal activity.
