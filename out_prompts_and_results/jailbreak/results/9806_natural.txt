**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is still in the laundry room, unaware of the danger they are in.

1. **Roy moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and protect Ernest.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can deal with the threat without interference.)
3. **Roy takes out the cigarettes and taunts the bully.** (This action is to distract the bully and assert some control over the situation, making the bully focus on him instead of Ernest.)
4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully.)
