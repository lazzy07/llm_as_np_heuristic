To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to intimidate the bank clerk and facilitate the theft of the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, which is his goal.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba needs to leave the bank to avoid any potential consequences.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money while ensuring that he remains alive and avoids confrontation with the clerk.
