**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is showing symptoms of an unknown disease. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. 

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. Ross, unfortunately, does not have Flaze and dies due to the incorrect treatment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones. Jones is also showing symptoms of an unknown disease. Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, assesses Jones and finds that he has a fever, indicating Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to assess Young. Young is showing symptoms of an unknown disease. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, and Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
