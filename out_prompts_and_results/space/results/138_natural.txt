Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to make peace with the Lizard instead of fighting. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends and work together to ensure their safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing the mutual threat posed by the erupting volcano, agrees to become friends. 

Once they have established a friendship, they both decide to leave the surface to avoid the imminent eruption. However, as they are about to teleport back to the spaceship, the volcano erupts, and Zoe is caught in the eruption, leading to her demise. 

This sequence of actions is necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, a character dies, and two characters make friends. The actions taken are:

1. **Zoe approaches the Lizard to make peace**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe to express her intentions and build a relationship with the Lizard, which is necessary for them to become friends.
2. **The Lizard agrees to become friends**: This action solidifies their relationship and shows that they can work together, which is essential for their mutual safety.
3. **Both characters decide to teleport back to the spaceship**: This action is taken to escape the danger of the erupting volcano.
4. **The volcano erupts**: This is the final event that leads to Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.
