**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.
3. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.
4. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** - This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat them. It also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 1, which is still manageable.
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** - Similar to the previous action, this ensures that Young is assigned to an exam room, allowing for assessment and treatment later. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 2, which is still safe.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** - This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing "Unknown," Dr. Hathaway will need to make a decision based on the assumption that Jones has Flaze (the only disease with a fever symptom).

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics.** - This action is the final step to ensure Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Since Jones is treated with the correct medication for Flaze, they become healthy.
