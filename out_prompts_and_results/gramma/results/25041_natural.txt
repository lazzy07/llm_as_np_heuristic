To ensure the guard achieves their goal of killing criminals, the following actions will take place:

1. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is necessary because the guard needs to know where the bandit is located to take action against her. The guard believes the bandit is at the camp, and reporting her location will allow the guard to focus on the bandit as a criminal.

2. **The guard walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is essential for the guard to confront the bandit directly. Since the bandit is at the camp, the guard must travel there to fulfill their goal of killing her.

3. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action is the culmination of the guard's goal. By attacking and killing the bandit, the guard successfully eliminates a criminal, achieving their objective.

The story is concise and directly leads to the guard's goal without unnecessary actions or diversions.
