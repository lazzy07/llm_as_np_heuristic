**Story Completion:**

After assessing Ross in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by SymptomA (fever). With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake, but she decides to treat Ross immediately to ensure he receives the correct treatment.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address Jones, who is still in the admissions room. Since Hathaway's workload has decreased to 2 after treating Ross, she can safely assess Jones without the risk of making a mistake.

2. **walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Jones walks to Exam Room B, where he has been assigned.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring he becomes healthy.

With both Ross and Jones treated successfully, Hathaway has achieved her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
