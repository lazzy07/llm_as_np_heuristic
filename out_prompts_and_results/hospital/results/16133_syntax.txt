To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to check Young's symptoms to determine the correct treatment. This is necessary because without assessing, Hathaway cannot know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with either antibiotics (if Young has Flaze) or steroids (if Young has Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess the next patient, Jones.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics or steroids, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Walk to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomB to assess Ross.

7. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms.

8. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with either antibiotics or steroids, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
