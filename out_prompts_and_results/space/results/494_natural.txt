Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is taken to move to a safer location where they can avoid the dangers of the surface, including the potential eruption of the volcano. By walking together, they strengthen their friendship and ensure they are both safe.

2. **The Lizard and Zoe make peace again in the cave.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in a safe space helps to solidify their relationship and ensures that they are both committed to helping each other.

3. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the spaceship is a secure environment away from the dangers of the planet's surface. The Lizard understands this action and does not become angry, as they have already established a friendship.

4. **The Lizard walks back to the cave.** This action allows the Lizard to return to a safe location, away from the dangers of the surface, ensuring that they remain healthy and safe.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
