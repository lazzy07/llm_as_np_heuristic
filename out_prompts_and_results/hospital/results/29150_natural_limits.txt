Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A, who is also experiencing Unknown. After assessing both patients, Hathaway realizes that both patients need to be treated, but she must be careful due to her workload.

Hathaway decides to treat Jones with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze, as she is unaware of his actual symptoms. This treatment fails, and Jones dies. However, Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, correctly identifying that he has Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. She assesses Young, who is also experiencing Unknown, and treats him with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Young dies as well.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, achieving her goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy, despite the unfortunate outcomes for Jones and Young.
