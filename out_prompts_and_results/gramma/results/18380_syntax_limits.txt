In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market, having just attacked the Merchant and taken the Medicine. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit is already at the Market and has the Medicine, the next logical step is to take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.

The Bandit can take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp without needing to interact with any other characters, as the Bandit is already armed and in a position to achieve her goal.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **take(Bandit, Coins, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills the Bandit's objective of acquiring coins.
