In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in the hospital admissions room and has a workload of 3. To achieve their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients assigned to them. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is already in PatientRoomA, this action is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). 

2. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess and treat Ross in PatientRoomB**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine their symptoms. If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat them with steroids, ensuring Ross also becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can effectively reduce their workload and ensure both Young and Ross are treated correctly, achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway assesses and treats both patients, leading to their health and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
