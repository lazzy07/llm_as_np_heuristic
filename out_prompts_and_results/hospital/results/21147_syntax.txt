To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Young, who is currently there. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to Admissions again to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine his symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified, ensuring that he becomes healthy as well.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, achieving the goal of making them healthy.
