To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom needs to get to the cottage to fulfill his goal. The only path available is from the Crossroads to the Cottage.

This single action is sufficient for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to move from the Crossroads, where he currently is, directly to the Cottage. Since he is already carrying the medicine, once he arrives at the Cottage, he will have achieved his goal.
