**Story Completion:**

Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knows that he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decides to crawl through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently located. 

Once in the gym, Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. With the bully trapped inside, Roy takes out the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen. He confronts the bully, who is now unable to threaten him or Ernest. In a moment of desperation, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer in danger.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to the hallway, where he can escape the prison using his disguise.
