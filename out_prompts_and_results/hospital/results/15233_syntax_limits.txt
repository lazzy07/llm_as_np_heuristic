To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to identify Ross's condition.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: Assuming Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the workload), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy; if he has Jarkis, he will die. However, this action is necessary to attempt to treat Ross.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine her symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment.

This sequence of actions is designed to maximize the chances of treating the patients effectively, despite the risk of error due to Hathaway's high workload.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.
- **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: This action is taken to attempt to cure Ross, even with the risk of a mistake due to Hathaway's workload.
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and ensure she receives the correct treatment.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
