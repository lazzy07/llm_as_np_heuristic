To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently in the same room (R22) as Alex, Casey, and Blake. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want. This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in a different room to facilitate the next actions.
   
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, which is I2.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This action is necessary to allow for the next trade.

4. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just picked up with Blake for the jewelry (I1). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to receive the item they want.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is the final step to ensure Alex has the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to leave R22 to pick up I2, which is in R21.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey needs to acquire I2 to be happy.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to R22 to facilitate the trade.
- **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: This trade allows Alex to get the jewelry they want.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This final action ensures Alex has I1, making them happy.
