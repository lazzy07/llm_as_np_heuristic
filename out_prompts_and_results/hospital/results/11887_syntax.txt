To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
2. **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.
3. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
4. **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to ensure Young receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_symptomB, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_symptomC, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, "SymptomB" and "SymptomC" represent the symptoms that Ross and Young have, respectively, and "treatment_for_symptomB" and "treatment_for_symptomC" represent the appropriate treatments for their diseases.
