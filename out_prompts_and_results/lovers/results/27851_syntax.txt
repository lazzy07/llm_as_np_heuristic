To achieve Blake's goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy, we need to focus on the items they want. Blake wants chocolates (I2), and Alex wants flowers (I1). Since Alex already has the flowers (I1) and Blake needs to get the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R21), the following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Alex and Casey are.
4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex, making Alex happy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to go to the dining room to get the chocolates, which is the only way to obtain the item they want.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: This action allows Blake to acquire the chocolates, which is necessary for Blake to be happy.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: After picking up the chocolates, Blake needs to return to the living room to interact with Alex.
4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: By giving the chocolates to Alex, Blake ensures that Alex is happy, which is important for Blake's own happiness.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex will also be happy because they received the chocolates.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
