**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can accurately assess him without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. 

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting. Since Hathaway's workload is now 1 (after treating Jones), he can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Jones**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment. It is crucial for Hathaway to know whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.
  
- **Treating Jones**: This action is essential as it directly addresses Jones's health issue. By administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze), Hathaway ensures that Jones recovers and achieves his goal of being healthy.

- **Assessing Ross**: This action is included to ensure that Hathaway can continue to help other patients. By assessing Ross, Hathaway can determine if he also needs treatment, thus working towards the overall goal of keeping all patients healthy.
