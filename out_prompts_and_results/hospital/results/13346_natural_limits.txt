Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Young.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, increasing the workload to 3.

4. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Due to the increased workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze instead of Jarkis. However, since Young is not treated yet, this mistake does not affect the outcome.

5. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing it is the right treatment. However, since Young is actually healthy, this treatment does not harm him.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
