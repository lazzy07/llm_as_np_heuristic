To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where I2 (chocolates) is located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to give or trade items.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to have an item to potentially trade or give to Alex.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex to interact.

4. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Alex. This is necessary because it allows Alex to receive an item, which may help in achieving happiness.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room. This action is necessary for Blake to be in a position to interact with Casey or Alex.

6. **pick_up(C2, I3, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry. This is necessary for Blake to have an item that they want.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey.

8. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex. This is necessary because it allows Alex to receive the item they want, which is I1 (flowers).

9. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to be in a position to interact with the items in the dining room.

10. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, achieving their happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers (I1), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is designed to facilitate the transfer of items between characters, ensuring that Alex ultimately receives the flowers they desire.
- The movements are necessary to ensure characters are in the correct locations to interact with each other and the items.
- The giving actions are crucial as they directly lead to Alex obtaining the item they want.
