To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Currently, I2 is unknown to Blake, but we know that Casey has it. The following actions will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to communicate about the item.

2. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I2). This is important because it informs Alex about Casey's desire, which is crucial for the next steps.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to facilitate the trade between Casey and Blake.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the item they want, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
