To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** (This is a lie, but it will motivate Casey to act.)
2. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.** (Casey is willing to trade the jewelry, believing it will make Blake happy.)
3. **Blake gives Casey the chocolates.** (Blake wants the chocolates and is willing to trade for the jewelry.)

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** - This action is necessary because it creates a false belief in Casey that trading the jewelry will make Alex happy, which aligns with Casey's desire to make Blake happy. This motivates Casey to give away the jewelry.
   
2. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.** - This action is crucial as it allows Casey to part with the jewelry, which is what they want. By giving the jewelry to Blake, Casey believes they are contributing to Blake's happiness, which is important to them.

3. **Blake gives Casey the chocolates.** - This action completes the trade. Blake receives the jewelry, which he may want, and in return, Casey receives the chocolates, which fulfills their goal of being happy since they now have an item they desire.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the chocolates, Blake will be happy because he has the jewelry, and Alex will remain happy with the flowers.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.",
    "Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.",
    "Blake gives Casey the chocolates."
