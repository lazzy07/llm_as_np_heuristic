In this story, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle after stealing it from the bank clerk. He is greedy and wants money, while also feeling hungry. The bank clerk is aware of Bubba's presence and is also greedy, but he is not in immediate danger since he is unarmed. Bambi, the deer, is alive in the forest and is not directly involved in the bank scenario.

To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will take place:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to shoot the bank clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to take all the money from the bank. This action directly leads to Bubba having the money, as the clerk will no longer be alive to defend his cash.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank without any opposition. This action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

The story is concise and effectively leads to the desired outcome with just two actions.
