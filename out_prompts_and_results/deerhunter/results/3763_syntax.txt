To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money.
2. **Go**: Bubba will go from the Bank to the Forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi.
3. **Shoot**: Bubba will shoot Bambi. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot and kill Bambi.
