Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both desires. He turns to the bank clerk, who has the money he wants. Since Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is taken because Bubba wants the money, and the clerk is the only one who has it. Shooting the clerk ensures that Bubba can take the money without any resistance.

2. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, fulfilling his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of Bubba having the money, while also resulting in the death of the clerk.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Bubba shoots the clerk", "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk"]
}
