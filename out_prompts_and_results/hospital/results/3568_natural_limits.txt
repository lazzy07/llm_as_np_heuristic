Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, he can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** Assuming Ross has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway administers steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.** This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and admit Young, who is currently in Admissions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for further assessment and treatment.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Ross, ensuring he becomes healthy, and also prepares to help Young.
