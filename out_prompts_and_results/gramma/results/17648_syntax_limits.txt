In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market and has just robbed the Merchant of a coin. The Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Market to the Bandit Camp, successfully carrying her coins to store them in the chest.
