The bandit, having just attacked and killed the hero at the cottage, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the merchant is at the market and the guard is also there, leaving her free to act without immediate threat. The bandit walks to the crossroads, then to the market, where she can find the merchant. 

Once at the market, the bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine that the merchant is carrying. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit returns to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her loot and count her coins.
