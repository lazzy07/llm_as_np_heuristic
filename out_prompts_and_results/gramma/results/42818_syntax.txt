To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom wants to be at the cottage, and since he is currently at the crossroads, he can walk directly to the cottage. This action fulfills his goal of reaching the cottage.

The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) are not directly involved in Tom's goal, and their actions do not need to be included since they do not affect Tom's ability to reach the cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because it allows Tom to move from his current location (Crossroads) to his desired location (Cottage) while carrying the medicine. Since Tom already has the medicine, this action directly leads him to achieve his goal.
