**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, Roy makes a bold decision. He locks the gym door to prevent the bully from coming out and threatening them. 

With the gym door locked, Roy then sneaks through the vents to the highway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Disguised and free from the prison's confines, Roy successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and avoiding the bully's threats.
