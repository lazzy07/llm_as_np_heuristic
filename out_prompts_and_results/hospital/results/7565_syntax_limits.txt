In this story, Young is currently in Patient Room C and wants to be alive and healthy. The goal is to ensure Young receives the correct treatment for their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway, who is currently in Patient Room C, will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, as the correct treatment depends on the accurate diagnosis.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. Since Young has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway will administer steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

These actions are essential for Young to achieve their goal of being alive and healthy. By assessing and then treating Young correctly, Hathaway ensures that Young recovers from their condition.
