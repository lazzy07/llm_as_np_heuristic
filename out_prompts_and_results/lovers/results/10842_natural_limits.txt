In the dining room, Alex sees that Casey has the flowers, which Alex wants. To achieve happiness, Alex decides to take action. 

**Action: Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the flowers.**  
- This action is included because it creates a sense of urgency for Casey to consider giving the flowers to Blake, even though Blake does not actually want them. This manipulation is necessary for Alex to achieve their goal of obtaining the flowers.

**Action: Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
- This action is included because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:  
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.  
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.  
- Casey is not happy because they have given away the flowers.
