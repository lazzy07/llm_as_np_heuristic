To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to make peace and become friends. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to be on the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for any interaction between them.
   - Action: `teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)`

2. **Zoe walks to the cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, facilitating a potential interaction that could lead to making peace.
   - Action: `walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)`

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Since they are now in the same location and not fighting, Zoe can attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendly relationship.
   - Action: `make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)`

4. **The volcano erupts**: After making peace, the volcano erupts, which is a predetermined event that will lead to the death of one character. Since Zoe is now friends with the Lizard, we can assume that the Lizard will be the one to die, as Zoe is safe on the ship.
   - Action: `erupt(Surface)`

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard making peace before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the surface**: Zoe needs to be on the planet to interact with the Lizard.
- **Walking to the cave**: This brings Zoe directly to the Lizard, allowing for a peaceful interaction.
- **Making peace**: This is essential for achieving the goal of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
- **Erupting the volcano**: This fulfills the requirement of a character dying and concludes the story.
