To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the flowers.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This is a strategic move to inform Casey of their desire, which may prompt Casey to act.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary for Casey to pick up the flowers and potentially give them to Alex.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers from the dining room. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the flowers. This allows Casey to be in the same room as Alex to give them the flowers.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
