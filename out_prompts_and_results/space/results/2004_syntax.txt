To complete the story where Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is already taken, and it establishes a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with other creatures.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to further solidify their friendship and ensure they are both safe from the erupting volcano.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe is in the cave with the Lizard, she can make peace again to reinforce their friendship. This action is important to ensure that both characters feel safe and secure in their relationship.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was present but does not affect Zoe and the Lizard since they are in a safe location.

5. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard can walk back to the surface to check on the situation, but since Zoe is already safe in the cave, this action does not endanger her.

6. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe can now safely walk back to the surface after the eruption has occurred, ensuring she is healthy and safe.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
