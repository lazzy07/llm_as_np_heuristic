**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is alive and the treatment is appropriate for Flaze, he becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Ross and Young, who are still waiting.

In the admissions room, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross first. Ross is also experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway, with a workload of 1, can accurately assess him. After the assessment, Hathaway determines that Ross has Jarkis due to the rash symptom. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing Unknown. With a workload of 0, Hathaway can accurately assess Young. After the assessment, Hathaway determines that Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, making Young healthy as well.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
