The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. The hero is dead, and the merchant is unarmed, making her an easy target. The bandit takes the following actions:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** The bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the hero's coin that the merchant is carrying. This action is necessary for the bandit to increase her coin count without risking confrontation with the guard, who is focused on the hero.

2. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp.** After robbing the merchant, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins. This action is essential for the bandit to secure her loot and fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the merchant**: This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to acquire coins without engaging in a dangerous fight, especially since the guard is present and focused on the hero.
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This action secures the coins in a safe location, ensuring that the bandit can keep her loot without the risk of losing it to the guard or any other character.
