To complete the story, Tom needs to get to the cottage while carrying the medicine. The current situation has Tom at the crossroads with the medicine, and the bandit is also at the crossroads. The bandit is a criminal and wants to take coins, but Tom's goal is to reach the cottage with the medicine. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will allow Tom to achieve his goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks directly from the crossroads to the cottage, carrying the medicine. This action is necessary because it allows Tom to reach his desired location with the item he wants.

The bandit does not take any action against Tom because she is not in a position to rob him without risking her own safety, as Tom is armed. The guard is at the market and does not intervene.

After this action, Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is the only necessary step for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. Since he is already armed and the bandit does not attack him, he can safely make his way to the cottage without any further conflict.
