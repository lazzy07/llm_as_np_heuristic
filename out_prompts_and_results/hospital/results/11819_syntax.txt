To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will then assess Ross in Exam Room C. This is important to ensure that Ross also receives the correct diagnosis and treatment.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the Admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that Young is also diagnosed correctly and treated.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to make Jones healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This will ensure that Young is also healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is crucial to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered. This prevents any mistakes that could arise from Hathaway's workload being too high.
- **Treating each patient** with the correct treatment based on their symptoms is necessary to achieve the goal of making all patients healthy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

Note: The treatment for Ross and Young is assumed to be antibiotics for the sake of this example, but it should be adjusted based on their actual symptoms determined during assessment.
