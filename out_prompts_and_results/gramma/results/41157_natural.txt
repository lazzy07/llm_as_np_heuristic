To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit robs the merchant of the medicine. 
   - This action is taken because the bandit wants to ensure that the merchant has no items that could be used against her, and it also allows the bandit to have the medicine, which could be useful later.

2. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store her coins safely.

3. The bandit places the hero's coin and the merchant's medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.
   - This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as she now has both the hero's coin and the medicine stored there.

The story is concise and focuses on the bandit's actions to achieve her goal without unnecessary interactions with the other characters.
