**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload being 3, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room C to assess Jones.

4. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition (Flaze), leading to Jones's death.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks back to Admissions to assess Ross.

7. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. With her workload still high, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

8. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition (Flaze), resulting in Ross's death.

At the end of these actions, Dr. Hathaway has treated all patients, but unfortunately, due to her mistakes caused by the high workload, all patients have died. However, she has completed her goal of assessing and treating all patients.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young, Jones, and Ross was necessary to determine their symptoms, even though the high workload led to mistakes.
- Treating Young, Jones, and Ross was necessary to attempt to make them healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of wanting all patients to be healthy.
- Walking between rooms was necessary to reach each patient for assessment and treatment.
