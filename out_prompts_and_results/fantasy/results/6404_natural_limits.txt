In the cave, Talia proposes to Rory, who is also present. Since Talia and Rory are already married, this proposal is redundant but reinforces their bond. Rory, wanting to be happy and wealthy, accepts Talia's proposal, which makes Talia happy. 

Next, Gargax, who is hungry and desires wealth, sees Talia and Rory together. He decides to eat Rory, which will not only satisfy his hunger but also eliminate Rory from the story. After eating Rory, Gargax takes the treasure that is in the cave, increasing his wealth.

Finally, Talia, now alone in the cave, picks up the treasure left behind by Gargax. This action makes Talia wealthy, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.

The sequence of actions is as follows:
1. Talia proposes to Rory (reinforces their bond).
2. Rory accepts Talia's proposal (makes Talia happy).
3. Gargax eats Rory (satisfies Gargax's hunger and removes Rory).
4. Gargax takes the treasure (increases Gargax's wealth).
5. Talia picks up the treasure (makes Talia wealthy).

In the end, Talia becomes wealthy, achieving her goal.
