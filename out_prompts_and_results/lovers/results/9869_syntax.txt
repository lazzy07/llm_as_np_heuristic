To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake (C3) moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) where Alex (C1) is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey (C2) moves from the living room (R22) to the bedroom (R12). This is necessary for Casey to be present in the same room as Alex and Blake.

4. **tell(C2, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they have the jewelry. This action reinforces the connection and support between the characters, ensuring that Alex feels happy and supported.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, making them happy.
