Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. Despite their initial differences, they have established a budding friendship. Zoe realizes that the only way to ensure both their safety is to leave the dangerous surface. 

To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, which is a safe distance away from the volcano. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, their newfound friendship and mutual goal of safety outweigh any potential conflict.

**Action:**
- teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, ship)

This action is chosen because it allows Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensures her safety. The Lizard, understanding the urgency of the situation, does not react negatively to Zoe's teleportation, as they both prioritize their well-being.

**Final Story:**
Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, leaving the dangerous surface behind. The Lizard, recognizing the need for safety, decides to follow Zoe's example and walks to the cave, where they can wait for the volcano to calm down.
