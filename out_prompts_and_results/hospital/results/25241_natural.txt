**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is essential to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is taken to treat Jones. If Jones actually has Flaze, he will become healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Ross, who is still in Admissions, to ensure he receives care as well.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the attention he needs, even though the focus is on Jones's health.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is taken to determine Young's symptoms, ensuring that all patients are being cared for.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has Jarkis, this treatment will help Young become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions focus on Jones, as the goal is for him to achieve health. The assessment is crucial to identify symptoms, and the treatment is aimed at curing him.
- The next two actions ensure that Ross is also admitted and assessed, maintaining the hospital's overall health care goals.
- The final two actions ensure that Young is also treated, which is important for the hospital's mission, even though the primary focus is on Jones.
