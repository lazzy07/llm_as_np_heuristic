To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, who has already proposed to her. Since Vince is currently in the Village with the Money, he can travel to the Cave to marry Talia, which will make her happy. Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels from the Village to the Cave to be with Talia. This is necessary because Talia is currently in the Cave, and they need to be in the same location to get married.

2. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Once Vince arrives at the Cave, he marries Talia. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling her desire.

After these actions, Talia will be happy due to the marriage, and Vince will also be happy as he has married Talia. 

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **Traveling**: Vince needs to be in the same location as Talia to marry her, so he must travel to the Cave.
- **Marrying**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness, as marriage is a significant source of happiness for her.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Vince, Village, Cave)",
    "marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia becomes happy through her marriage to Vince, achieving her goal effectively.
