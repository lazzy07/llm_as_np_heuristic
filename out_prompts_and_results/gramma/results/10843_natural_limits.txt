Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He knows he needs to get back to the cottage to fulfill his goal. The guard and the bandit are at the market, and Tom is aware that he is a criminal, which could complicate his journey. However, he decides to take a risk.

Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, successfully reaching his destination with the medicine in hand. 

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine. No other actions are needed since Tom's goal is achieved in one step.
