To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to intimidate the bank clerk and steal the money.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba needs to leave the bank to ensure he is safe with his new possession.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money while ensuring that he remains alive and does not harm anyone.
