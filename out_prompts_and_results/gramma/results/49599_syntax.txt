To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is not armed. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin that Tom has, which is necessary for her goal of accumulating coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her loot.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first and crucial step for the Bandit to gain coins without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed and is an easy target.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a safe location where she can store her newly acquired coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action confirms that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of accumulating coins.
