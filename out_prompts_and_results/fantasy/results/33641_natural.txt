To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to obtain the treasure that Rory possesses. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Gargax needs to reach the village where Rory is located to take the treasure.

2. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. By eating Rory, Gargax can also take the treasure that Rory has.

3. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body.**  
   - After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that Rory had, thus achieving wealth.

At this point, Gargax has satisfied both of their goals: they are no longer hungry (having eaten Rory) and they have obtained the treasure, making them wealthy.
