To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coins she has. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without becoming a criminal, as the Merchant is not armed.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will take the coins she has acquired and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first robbing the Merchant for coins and then securing those coins in her camp.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- The first action is essential for the Bandit to increase her wealth without risking confrontation with the Guard, who is now dead.
- The second action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored safely, fulfilling her objective.
