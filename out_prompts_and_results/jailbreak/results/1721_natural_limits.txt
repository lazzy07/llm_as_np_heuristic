**Story Completion:**

Roy, aware of the bully's threat, decides to take action to protect both himself and Ernest. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym and cannot reach them. To ensure their safety, Roy takes the knife he stole from the kitchen and crawls through the vents to the gym. Once inside, he confronts the bully, who is surprised to see him. In a swift move, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat once and for all.
