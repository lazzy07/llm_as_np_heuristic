On day one, after completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and has threatened both him and Ernest. To protect himself and his friend, Roy sneaks back to the kitchen and takes the knife he had stolen earlier. He then moves to the hallway, where he can hear the bully's laughter echoing from the gym.

Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. With the knife in hand, he confronts the bully. In a moment of desperation and self-defense, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
