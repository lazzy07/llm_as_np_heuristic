To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reasons as assessing Jones.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently there.

6. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify his condition.

7. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
