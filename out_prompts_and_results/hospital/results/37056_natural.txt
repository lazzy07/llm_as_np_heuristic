**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, assesses Young, who is experiencing a fever. Since Young has a fever, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross, who is still in Admissions. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A. After admitting Ross, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to Dr. Hathaway's workload being at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Unfortunately, Ross does not have Flaze and dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to check on Young, who is now healthy. Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy is achieved.
