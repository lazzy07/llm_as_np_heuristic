Tom is at the bandit camp after successfully buying the medicine he wanted. He knows that the bandit is nearby in the market, and he believes that the merchant is also at the camp with him. To achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, Tom decides to walk back to the crossroads first.
