To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). Given the current situation, here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Blake to have the item that Casey wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Casey is. This is necessary for Blake to give the chocolates to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the chocolates, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake is happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey is happy because they received the chocolates (I2).

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to be in the dining room to pick up the chocolates.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates, which is the item Casey wants.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room to give the chocolates to Casey.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey, making Casey happy.
