To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. The bandit will loot the hero's corpse to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the bandit can take advantage of the hero's death to acquire an item that may be valuable or useful.
2. The bandit will walk from the market to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the medicine and any coins she may have taken from the hero, ensuring they are safely stored in the bandit camp.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Loot the hero's corpse**: The bandit takes the medicine from the dead hero. This is a strategic move to gain an item that could be valuable or useful for future dealings or trades.
2. **Walk from the market to the bandit camp**: The bandit moves to the camp to secure the medicine and any coins she may have taken, ensuring they are safely stored in her possession.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying the medicine and potentially securing coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
