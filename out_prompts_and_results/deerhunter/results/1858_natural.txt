Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba becomes greedy.** (This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of wanting to have money.)
2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants the money, and since he has a rifle, he can attempt to steal it.)
3. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Bubba can take the money without resistance.)
4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.)
