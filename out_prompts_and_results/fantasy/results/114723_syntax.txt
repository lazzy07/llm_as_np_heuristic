To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for Rory to obtain wealth, as the treasure is the only item that can help him achieve this goal.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy, as he needs to possess the treasure to fulfill his goal.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with the treasure. This is important because Rory needs to be in the village to interact with Talia and ensure his happiness.

4. **propose(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory proposes to Talia. This action is necessary for Rory to pursue happiness through a romantic relationship.

5. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This is crucial for both characters to achieve happiness through their relationship.

6. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married. This final action solidifies their relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness.

At the end of these actions, Rory has achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage with Talia), wealthy (by acquiring the treasure), and not hungry (as there is no indication of hunger in the actions taken).
