To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s a concise story that leads to that outcome:

1. **Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R22)**. This action is strategic because it misleads Blake into thinking that Alex's happiness is tied to the jewelry, which may prompt Blake to act in a way that helps Casey.
   
2. **Blake picks up the jewelry (I3) from the living room (R22)**. Blake believes that by picking up the jewelry, they are helping Alex, as per the misinformation provided by Casey.

3. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the living room (R22)**. This action directly helps Casey achieve their goal of happiness, as they now possess the item they want.

4. **Casey is now happy** because they have the jewelry (I3).
