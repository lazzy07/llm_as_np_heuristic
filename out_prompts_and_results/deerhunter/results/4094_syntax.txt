To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk and take the money.

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After acquiring the money, Bubba can go to the forest to find Bambi. By eating Bambi, he ensures that she is dead, which satisfies the second condition of the goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead, achieving the desired outcome.
