To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers** (which are currently with Casey in the bathroom).
2. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room** (to be closer to Alex).
3. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex** (in the living room).

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Casey picks up the flowers**: This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey currently has them.
2. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room**: This action is required to bring the flowers to Alex, who is in the living room.
3. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex**: This is the final action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, while Casey will still want the jewelry, and Blake will still want the chocolates, but the focus is on Alex achieving their goal.
