Zoe, realizing that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the volcano's imminent eruption, decides to teleport back to the surface to confront the Lizard. She believes that if she can communicate with the Lizard, they might be able to form a friendship before the volcano erupts.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to meet the Lizard, hoping to establish a connection before the situation worsens.

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and attempts to communicate. However, the Lizard is wary and feels threatened by Zoe's sudden appearance. To ease the tension, Zoe decides to make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe reaches out to the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's genuine intentions, agrees to put aside their differences.

As they begin to bond, the volcano erupts, creating chaos around them. Unfortunately, the eruption is too powerful, and the Lizard is caught in the blast.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's demise. Despite the tragic outcome, Zoe feels a sense of accomplishment in having made a friend, even if only for a brief moment.

In this story, the actions taken are necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, a character dies, and two characters make friends. The teleportation allows Zoe to reach the Lizard, and the peace-making action is crucial for establishing a friendship before the disaster strikes.
