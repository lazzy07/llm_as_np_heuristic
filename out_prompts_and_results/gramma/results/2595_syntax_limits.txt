In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has no coins on her person, but there are coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp to access the coins stored in the chest.

This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to reach the Bandit Camp to fulfill her goal of having coins. Since there are no other characters present at the Bandit Camp, there is no need for any further actions.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows the Bandit to achieve her goal with the minimum number of actions.
