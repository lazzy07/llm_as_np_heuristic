**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, decides to escape from the prison. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells and is threatened by the bully. To ensure that Ernest can escape safely, Roy first needs to create a distraction.

1. **Roy locks the gym door.** This action prevents the bully from coming out and threatening Ernest while Roy makes his escape. It also keeps the bully occupied, allowing Roy to focus on his escape.

2. **Roy escapes from the prison.** With the gym door locked and the bully unable to pursue him, Roy takes advantage of his disguise and leaves the prison grounds.

3. **Roy successfully escapes.** Now outside the prison, Roy is free and can live without the threat of the bully.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Locking the gym door is crucial for ensuring that the bully cannot reach Ernest while Roy is escaping. This action directly protects both characters from the bully's threat.
- Escaping from the prison is the ultimate goal for Roy, allowing him to achieve his desire to be alive and free.
