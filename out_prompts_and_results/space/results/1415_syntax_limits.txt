In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. Both characters are currently safe but aware of the danger surrounding them. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and one character die, while also ensuring that they become friends, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe will make peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better, which is essential for their safety and friendship.

2. **The volcano will erupt.** This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of having a character die. Since both characters are on the surface and the volcano is erupting, they will be in danger.

Here’s how the story unfolds:

- Zoe approaches the Lizard and, realizing the imminent danger of the volcano, suggests they work together to find safety. They agree to put aside any differences and become friends, which strengthens their bond.
- As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, and unfortunately, Zoe is caught in the eruption, leading to her demise.

This sequence of actions achieves the desired outcome of having the volcano erupt, resulting in Zoe's death, while also ensuring that the Lizard and Zoe become friends before the eruption.
