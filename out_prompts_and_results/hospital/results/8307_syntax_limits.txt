After Young walks from PatientRoomC to PatientRoomA, they find themselves in the same room as Ross. Young notices that Ross appears to have a fever, a symptom of Flaze. Young, wanting to help, encourages Hathaway to assess Ross.

1. **Assess (Hathaway, Ross, fever, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and confirms that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Ross's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat (Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross's health and achieving Young's goal of having all patients healthy.

3. **Walk (Young, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: After Ross is treated and becomes healthy, Young walks to the Admissions room to check on Jones, who is still waiting to be assessed. This action is necessary for Young to ensure that all patients are attended to.

4. **Admit (Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Jones to PatientRoomB, preparing him for assessment and treatment. This action is essential for ensuring that Jones receives the care he needs, contributing to the overall goal of health for all patients.
