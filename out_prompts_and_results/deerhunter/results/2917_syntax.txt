To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest, has just shot Bambi, and is feeling greedy. He needs to go back to the bank to get the money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the bank clerk.
3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, but since he is already greedy and has stolen the money, this action is not necessary for achieving the goal but shows his character's state.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling the goal of Bubba having the money.
3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: While this action does not directly contribute to the goal of having money or ensuring Bambi is dead, it reflects Bubba's state of hunger and greed.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
