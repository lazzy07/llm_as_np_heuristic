To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Casey to have an item that can be used to trade.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary to interact with them and facilitate a trade.

4. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Alex. This action is important because it allows Casey to offer something of value to Alex in exchange for the jewelry.

5. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey in exchange for the chocolates. This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates, which is the only item they can use to trade.
- After picking up the chocolates, Casey returns to the living room to interact with Alex.
- Casey gives the chocolates to Alex, which is a strategic move to gain the jewelry.
- Alex, in turn, gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.
