Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, decides to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room C. Since Ross is the only patient in an assigned room, Hathaway can determine his symptoms. 

1. **Action: Assess Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to understand Ross's condition. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, assessing him will help Hathaway identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway discovers that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis.

2. **Action: Treat Ross in Patient Room C with steroids.**  
   - Explanation: Since Ross has been diagnosed with Jarkis, treating him with steroids is the correct course of action. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to admit Young.

3. **Action: Admit Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: By admitting Young to Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway can prepare to assess and treat him next, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and treated appropriately.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, and with Young admitted, he is on track to help him as well.
