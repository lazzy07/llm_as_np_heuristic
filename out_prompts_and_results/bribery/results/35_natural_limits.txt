In the bank, the villain, having successfully threatened the hero and coerced them into giving up the Money, now has the upper hand. The villain, with the Money in hand, approaches the President, who is under the villain's control due to the bribe. The villain demands that the President transfer the Money to Unknown, fulfilling their goal.

The villain takes the action of giving the Money to the President, who, being controlled by the villain, complies without hesitation. The President, wanting Unknown to have the Money, accepts it and transfers it to Unknown.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to the villain achieving their goal of having Unknown receive the Money. The villain's control over the President ensures that the action is executed without resistance.
