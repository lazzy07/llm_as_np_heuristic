5. **Rory travels from the cave to the village**: Rory, who is at the cave, will travel back to the village. This is necessary for Rory to reunite with Talia and ensure they are not hungry.

6. **Rory proposes to Talia**: Rory will propose to Talia again, as they are now both in the village. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve happiness through marriage.

7. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: Talia will accept Rory's proposal, which is essential for both characters to be happy.
