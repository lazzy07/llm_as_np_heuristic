To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba's goal being clearly stated and achieved.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank. (Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk.)
2. Bubba decides to eat. (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
3. Bubba eats Bambi. (Bubba can eat Bambi since Bambi is dead, satisfying his hunger.)

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money, and he has also satisfied his hunger. The clerk remains at the bank, and the story concludes with Bubba's needs met.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: This action is necessary for Bubba to be in a location where he can interact with the bank clerk, even though he does not need to steal or get more money.
- **Bubba decides to eat**: This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs to address that need.
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action is taken to satisfy Bubba's hunger since Bambi is dead, and it allows Bubba to fulfill his need for food.
