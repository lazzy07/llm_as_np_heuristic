Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano erupting.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard needs to find a safe place away from the surface. The cave is a secure location where it can stay safe from the dangers of the surface and the volcano.

3. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure it is safe. Although this action makes the Lizard angry, it is important for Zoe to maintain their friendship and check on her friend.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - After Zoe's return, they reaffirm their friendship, which is crucial for both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while fostering their relationship.

5. **The volcano erupts.** - The eruption is a natural event that occurs after the characters have taken their actions. However, since Zoe is on the spaceship and the Lizard is in the cave, both characters remain safe.

In this sequence of actions, Zoe ensures her safety by teleporting to the spaceship, while the Lizard finds refuge in the cave. Their friendship is solidified through the act of making peace, allowing both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy and safe.
