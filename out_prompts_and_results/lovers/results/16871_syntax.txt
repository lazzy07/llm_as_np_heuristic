To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) to be closer to Casey, who has the jewelry (I1).
2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I1) from the bathroom (R12) where it is currently located.
3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the bathroom (R12). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
