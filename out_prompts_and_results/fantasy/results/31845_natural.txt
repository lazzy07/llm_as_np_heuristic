To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince currently has the money but no treasure. Picking up the treasure will increase his wealth, which is one of his goals.

2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to travel to the village to be with Talia and Rory, as they are his partners. This will help him achieve happiness, as being with loved ones typically contributes to happiness.

3. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant in terms of achieving happiness, but it reinforces the bond and commitment among them.

4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Talia acknowledges Vince's proposal, which contributes to Vince's happiness.

5. **Talia and Vince get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship, ensuring that Vince feels happy and fulfilled in his commitment.

6. **Vince becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to show that Vince's hunger status can change, but it does not affect his wealth or happiness directly.

7. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - This action is included to show the consequences of hunger and the potential danger in the cave, but it ultimately leads to Vince's demise, which is not aligned with his goals.

However, since the goal is to ensure Vince achieves happiness and wealth, we will adjust the actions to avoid his death:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.**
2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**
3. **Vince proposes marriage to Talia.**
4. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.**
5. **Talia and Vince get married.**

With these actions, Vince achieves his goals of happiness and wealth without any negative consequences.
