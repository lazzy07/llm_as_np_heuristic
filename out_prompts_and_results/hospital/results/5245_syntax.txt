To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first reduce the workload by treating one patient correctly, which will allow Hathaway to assess the remaining patients without the risk of error.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **Assess Ross** in Exam Room A. This will help Hathaway determine Ross's symptoms.
2. **Treat Ross** based on the assessment. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, making him healthy.
3. **Assess Young** in Exam Room B. This will help Hathaway determine Young's symptoms.
4. **Treat Young** based on the assessment. If Young has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, making him healthy.
5. **Assess Jones** in Admissions. This will help Hathaway determine Jones's symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones** based on the assessment. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, making him healthy.

This sequence ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat each patient without the risk of making a mistake due to high workload.
