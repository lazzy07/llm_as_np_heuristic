The secret agent, now armed with the gun and holding the papers, realizes that the mastermind is in the office with them. The agent knows that the only way to ensure the mastermind's demise is to act quickly. 

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the office (this action is redundant but serves to emphasize the agent's presence in the office where the mastermind is).
2. The secret agent kills the mastermind with the gun.

This sequence of actions ensures that the mastermind is dead, fulfilling the secret agent's goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Move to the office**: This action is technically unnecessary since the secret agent is already in the office, but it reinforces the setting and confirms the agent's readiness to confront the mastermind.
- **Kill the mastermind**: This is the critical action that achieves the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.
