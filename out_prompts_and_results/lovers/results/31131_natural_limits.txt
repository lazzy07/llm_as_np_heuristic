In the living room, Alex is happy with the flowers that Casey gave them. However, Blake and Casey are not happy because they do not have the items they want. To help Blake achieve happiness, Alex decides to take action.

**Action:**
1. Alex moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates.

**Explanation:**
- Alex moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates because Blake wants them. By doing this, Alex can help Blake achieve happiness, which is also important to Alex. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the dining room with the chocolates.
- Blake is in the living room, now happy because Alex has the chocolates.
- Casey is still in the living room, not happy because they still want the jewelry.

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, and they already are with the flowers, this action fulfills the requirement of the story.
