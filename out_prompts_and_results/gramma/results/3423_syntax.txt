4. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using the coin he has. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.

5. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: After acquiring the medicine, Tom walks back to the crossroads. This action is necessary for Tom to return to the crossroads before heading back to the cottage.
