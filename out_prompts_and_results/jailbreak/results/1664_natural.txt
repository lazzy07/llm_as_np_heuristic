**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Roy is still in the cells and is in danger from the bully. To ensure both of their safety, he decides to act quickly.

1. **Ernest moves from the highway to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to Roy and to potentially help him.)
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to reach the gym without being seen by the bully.)
3. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, he prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him safely.)
4. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This is necessary for Ernest to defend himself and to eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)
5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action removes the immediate threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to be safe.)
6. **Ernest returns to the hallway.** (He needs to get back to Roy to help him escape.)
7. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (This allows Roy to join him without the threat of the bully.)
8. **Ernest and Roy put on civilian clothes.** (This disguises them for their escape.)
9. **Ernest and Roy escape to the highway.** (This is the final action that allows them to leave the prison safely.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure Ernest can eliminate the bully, who poses a threat to both him and Roy, while also allowing them to escape together. The locking and unlocking of the gym door are crucial for controlling the situation with the bully. The retrieval of the knife is essential for self-defense and to ensure the bully cannot harm them. Finally, the escape to the highway is the ultimate goal, allowing both characters to achieve their desire to be alive and free.
