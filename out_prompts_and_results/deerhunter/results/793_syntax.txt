To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a loaded rifle, while the bank clerk is at the bank with some money. Bambi is also in the forest with Bubba. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, having a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a logical next step after killing an animal.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba decides he wants money. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba then goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and potentially take the money.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba can steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action ensures that Bubba ends up with the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Kills Bambi, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger after killing Bambi.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Motivates Bubba to seek out money.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
