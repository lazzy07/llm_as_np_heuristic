**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment plan.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, ensuring that both patients can receive appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial for Jones's recovery and aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is essential for Ross's recovery and further supports Hathaway's goal of patient health.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (assessing Jones and Ross) are necessary to gather information about their conditions, which is critical for making informed treatment decisions.
- The last two actions (treating Jones and Ross) are the culmination of Hathaway's efforts to ensure that both patients receive the correct treatment based on their diagnoses, leading to their recovery.
