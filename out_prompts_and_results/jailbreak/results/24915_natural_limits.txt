**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Roy realizes he has the upper hand. He knows the bully is trapped inside with him, and he has the knife. With a surge of determination, Roy decides to confront the bully. He approaches the bully, who is furious and demanding to be let out. 

Roy, feeling threatened but emboldened by the knife in his hand, takes a deep breath and lunges at the bully, using the knife to defend himself. In a swift motion, he manages to overpower the bully, killing him in the process. 

With the bully no longer a threat, Roy takes a moment to collect himself. He knows he needs to escape before the guards come looking for the commotion. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he had hidden in the laundry room earlier, disguising himself. 

Now disguised, Roy sneaks through the vent back to the hallway. Once there, he makes his way to the highway outside the prison. With the guards unaware of his escape, Roy successfully leaves the prison, finally free.
