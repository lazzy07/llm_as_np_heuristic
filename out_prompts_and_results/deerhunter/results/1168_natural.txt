To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the forest, has a rifle, and is hungry. The clerk is at the bank with 1 money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** (Bubba is already wanting money, so this action reinforces his goal.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money from the clerk.)
4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba returns to the forest after stealing the money.)
5. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can now eat Bambi, who is not alive.)

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Deciding to get money** is crucial as it aligns Bubba's actions with his goal.
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money** is the action that directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.
- **Returning to the forest** is a logical step after obtaining the money, as it allows Bubba to be in a safe location.
- **Deciding to eat** is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal of having money, but it aligns with Bubba's hunger and provides closure to the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to get money",
    "go from the forest to the bank",
    "steal the money from the clerk",
    "go from the bank to the forest",
    "decide to eat"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger.
