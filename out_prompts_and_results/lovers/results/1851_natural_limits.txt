In the living room, Alex holds the flowers and is happy. Blake, who is not happy, wants the chocolates in the dining room. Casey, also not happy, wants the jewelry that is currently in the living room. 

To achieve their goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.** This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still happy with the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry.

This action is necessary because it directly leads to Casey achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
