To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba returns to the forest after acquiring the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to eliminate the clerk and gain access to the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly leads to Bubba having the money, which is one of the goals.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action concludes the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank after achieving his goal.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
