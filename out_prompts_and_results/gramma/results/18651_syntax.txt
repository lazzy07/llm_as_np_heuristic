To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, who is armed, will rob the Merchant and take the medicine. This action is necessary because Tom needs the medicine to fulfill his goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp to secure the medicine and any coins she may have.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, now carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom ends up at the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Crossroads)**: This action allows the Bandit to take the medicine from the Merchant, which is crucial for Tom's goal.
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit moves to a safe location (the Bandit Camp) after acquiring the medicine, ensuring she is not in immediate danger.
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks to the Cottage, which is his desired location, now carrying the medicine.
