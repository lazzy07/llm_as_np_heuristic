**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he has the knife. He decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can be safe from the bully's threats. 

Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from coming after them and gives Roy a chance to confront him without the risk of being attacked. 

With the gym door locked, Roy then goes into the gym, where he confronts the bully. Using the knife he stole from the kitchen, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. 

Now that the bully is out of the way, Roy can focus on escaping the prison. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. 

Finally, Roy makes his way to the highway, where he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
