To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness.

2. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps to set up the next actions for Blake and Casey, as they both want to find their respective items (chocolates and jewelry).

3. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - Blake moves to the dining room to look for the chocolates, which he wants. This action is necessary for Blake to eventually achieve his own happiness.

4. **Blake picks up chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the chocolates, fulfilling his desire for happiness.

5. **Casey moves to the living room.**  
   - Casey moves back to the living room to check on Alex and Blake, ensuring that the story remains cohesive and all characters are accounted for.

6. **Casey gives jewelry to Blake in the living room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but allows Casey to achieve their own happiness by giving the jewelry to Blake, who can then be happy with the jewelry.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, fulfilling the goal of the story.
