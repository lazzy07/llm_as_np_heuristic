To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the Market to the Merchant**: This action is necessary for Tom to reach the Merchant, where the medicine is located. Since Tom is currently at the Market, he needs to move to the Merchant's location to acquire the medicine.

2. **Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant using one of his coins**: This action allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires. Since he has coins, he can purchase the medicine, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

After these actions, Tom will have the medicine and can then walk to the cottage in the next step (not included in the action count as per the requirement). 

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- **walk(Tom, Market, Merchant)**: This is necessary for Tom to reach the Merchant and acquire the medicine.
- **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)**: This allows Tom to obtain the medicine he needs to fulfill his goal.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Merchant)",
    "buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Merchant)"
  ]
}
