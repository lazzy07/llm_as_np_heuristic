Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that she needs to establish a connection with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. Since they are not currently fighting, Zoe decides to take a peaceful approach.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and healthy. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the erupting volcano.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action is taken to move to a safer location away from the erupting surface. The cave provides shelter from the volcanic activity, ensuring both characters remain safe.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** After reaching the cave, their peaceful interaction solidifies their friendship. This is essential for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with other creatures, including the Lizard.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully ensures her safety, the Lizard's safety, and establishes a friendship with the Lizard.
