**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of his decision. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, continues to pace, waiting for the moment he can unleash his threats on Ernest.

Roy takes a deep breath and lunges at the bully, using the knife to stab him. The bully, caught off guard, falls to the ground, lifeless. With the threat eliminated, Roy quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole earlier. He then unlocks the gym door and makes his way to the hallway.

Once in the hallway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. He sneaks through the vents and emerges outside on the highway. With the prison behind him, Roy successfully escapes, finally free and alive.
