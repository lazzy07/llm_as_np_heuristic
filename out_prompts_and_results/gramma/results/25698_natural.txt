To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to confront the bandit and potentially negotiate or steal coins from her.

2. **The merchant attacks the bandit.**  
   - The merchant is armed and can attack the bandit, who is also armed. This action is crucial as it allows the merchant to eliminate the bandit and take her coins.

3. **The merchant loots the bandit's corpse.**  
   - After successfully attacking the bandit, the merchant can loot her corpse to acquire the coins that the bandit was carrying.

4. **The merchant walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to return to a safer location after acquiring the coins.

5. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant prefers to be at the market, and this action allows her to finalize her transactions there.

By following these actions, the merchant successfully acquires coins without becoming a criminal, as she only attacked the bandit, who was a criminal.
