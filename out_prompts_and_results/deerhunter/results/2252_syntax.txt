To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is already in the Forest, and he needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and get the money. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use his loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the Clerk, who is the only character with money.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can return to the Forest and eat Bambi. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money from the Clerk and that Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the Clerk and access the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the Clerk, who possesses the money, thus achieving Bubba's goal of acquiring wealth.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the two possible endings.
