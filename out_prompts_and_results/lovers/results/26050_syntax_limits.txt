In the current situation, Casey wants to be happy and has a desire for the jewelry (I3). However, they are currently not happy because they do not possess the item they want. 

To achieve Casey's goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey (C3) can trade the jewelry (I3) they received from Blake (C2) for the flowers (I1) that Alex (C1) has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy as well, since they wanted the flowers.
- Blake will still have the chocolates (I2) and will be happy because they want Alex to be happy.

This single trade action ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
