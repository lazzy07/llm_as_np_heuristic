To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human, and Rory is at the cave where Gargax is located. By eating Rory, Gargax will satisfy their hunger, and Rory will no longer be alive, which will lead to Rory's happiness being reset to 0, but it will also allow Rory to achieve their goal of not being hungry.

2. **Vince takes the money from Rory's dead body**: After Rory is eaten, Vince can take the money from Rory's body. This action is crucial for Vince to become wealthy, which is part of Rory's goal of being wealthy as well, since Rory is married to Talia and Vince.

3. **Talia and Vince get married**: This action is necessary to ensure that Talia and Vince are happy together, which indirectly contributes to Rory's happiness as well, since they are all interconnected through marriage.

4. **Talia proposes to Vince**: This action is needed to solidify their relationship and ensure that both Talia and Vince are happy, which is part of Rory's goal of happiness.

5. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: This action is necessary for Talia to affirm her commitment to Vince, ensuring both characters are happy.

6. **Talia and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies their relationship, ensuring that both characters are happy, which contributes to Rory's overall happiness.

The sequence of actions leads to Rory achieving their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, despite the tragic outcome of being eaten.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

    "Talia proposes to Vince",
    "Talia accepts Vince's proposal",
    "Talia and Vince get married"
  ]
}

Each action is necessary to ensure that Rory's goals are met, even if it comes at the cost of their life.
