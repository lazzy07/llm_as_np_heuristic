To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Since they have already made peace, the next step is to ensure they both leave the dangerous surface of the planet. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to her spaceship, which will keep her safe, and then she can invite the Lizard to join her on the ship, fostering friendship.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to her spaceship to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous.
2. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Surface)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship to join Zoe, ensuring both characters are safe and allowing them to bond further.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensure her health and safety. Since the surface is dangerous, staying there is not an option for her goal.
   
2. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Surface)**: This action allows the Lizard to join Zoe on the spaceship, which is a safe environment. By doing this, they can continue to build their friendship in a secure setting.

With these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
