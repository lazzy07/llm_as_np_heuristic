The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is stationed. The bandit knows that the guard is unaware of her presence and believes she can take advantage of this. 

Once at the market, the bandit spots the guard and quickly draws her sword. She attacks the guard, who is unarmed and unable to defend himself.
