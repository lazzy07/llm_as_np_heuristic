To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we can take the following action:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory will travel to the Cave to pick up the Treasure. This action is necessary because Talia's happiness and wealth can be increased by acquiring the Treasure, which Rory can then bring back to her.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Talia will not have the Treasure yet, but Rory will have it, which can lead to Talia's happiness if Rory proposes to give it to her or if they decide to share it.

This single action is sufficient to set the stage for Talia's potential happiness or wealth, as it allows for the possibility of future actions involving the Treasure.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["travel(Rory, Village, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan is minimal and directly leads to the potential for Talia's happiness or wealth by acquiring the Treasure.
