To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the items and characters.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This action is essential as it allows Casey to have an item that they can potentially trade or give away.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room. This is necessary for Casey to be closer to Alex and to facilitate a potential trade or gift.

4. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room to meet Casey. This is important for Alex to be in the same room as Casey to interact.

5. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the flowers (I1) with Alex. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want, thus making Alex happy.

6. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bedroom. This action is not directly related to Alex's happiness but is necessary for the overall flow of the story.

7. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom. This is a concluding action that signifies Alex's contentment with the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
