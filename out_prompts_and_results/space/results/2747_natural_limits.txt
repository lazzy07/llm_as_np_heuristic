Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard, despite their previous misunderstandings. She believes that by showing concern for the Lizard's safety, they can begin to build a friendship. 

Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface. Upon her arrival, she sees the Lizard struggling with the volcanic activity. Instead of fighting, she offers her assistance, which surprises the Lizard. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's genuine intent to help, accepts her offer. They work together to find shelter from the eruptions, and in doing so, they form a bond of friendship.

This action is included because it directly leads to the characters making friends, which is one of their goals. By choosing to help rather than fight, Zoe and the Lizard can overcome their differences and work towards a common goal of safety.

However, as they find shelter, the volcano erupts violently, and the Lizard is caught in the eruption, leading to its demise. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also allowing for the friendship to be established before the tragic end.
