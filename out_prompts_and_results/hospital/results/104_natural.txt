**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C, confirming that he has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. After admitting Young, Hathaway assesses him in Patient Room B and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Jones. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has a fever and treats him with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this treatment does not match Jones's actual condition, and he dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated both Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring that the patients who could be saved are healthy.
