To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to have an item to offer in exchange for the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and the jewelry (I1) are located. This is necessary to facilitate the exchange.

4. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **put_down(C1, I2, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to reflect the completion of the trade.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, while Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy.
