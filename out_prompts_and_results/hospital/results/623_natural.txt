**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for better management of the patients.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload remains manageable.

Then, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but again, Hathaway cannot determine the disease.

With the workload still manageable, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, mistakenly believing Jones has Flaze due to the unknown symptoms. Fortunately, Jones actually has Flaze, so he becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, mistakenly believing Young has Jarkis. However, Young actually has Flaze, so this treatment fails, and Young dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Ross actually has Jarkis, so this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Young and Ross, Jones is now healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to manage the patients effectively and keep Hathaway's workload under control.
2. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: This action is crucial to determine Jones's condition, even though the symptoms are unknown.
3. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Similar to Jones, assessing Young is necessary to understand his condition.
4. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This action is taken to treat Jones based on the assumption of Flaze, which turns out to be correct, making him healthy.
5. **Treat Young with steroids**: This action is taken based on the assumption of Jarkis, but it fails as Young has Flaze.
6. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: This action is taken based on the assumption of Flaze, but it fails as Ross has Jarkis.
