To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will loot the coin from Tom, who is currently unarmed and unable to defend himself. This action helps the bandit increase her coin count.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has coins secured in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- The first action (looting Tom) is crucial because it allows the bandit to acquire more coins directly from Tom, who is vulnerable after the previous attacks. This increases her total coin count, which is one of her goals.
  
- The second action (taking coins from the chest) is necessary to ensure that the bandit has coins stored safely, which is another aspect of her goal. By securing coins in her camp, she can ensure that she has a stash to rely on later.

With these two actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible and having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
