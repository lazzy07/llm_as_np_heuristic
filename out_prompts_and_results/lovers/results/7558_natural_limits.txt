In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Blake. To achieve their goal, Alex can simply ask Blake to give the flowers to them.

**Action:**
- Alex tells Blake to give the flowers to them.

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire to obtain the flowers. Since Blake has the flowers, asking for them is the most straightforward way for Alex to achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still unhappy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is still unhappy because they still want the jewelry.

However, the goal of Alex being happy is achieved.
