To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because it places Zoe in a dangerous situation where the volcano can erupt, fulfilling the requirement for the volcano to erupt and a character to die.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.**  
   - This event is crucial as it leads to the death of Zoe, which is one of the required outcomes of the story.

3. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - The Lizard needs to be present on the surface to witness the eruption and Zoe's fate, which is important for the emotional impact of the story.

4. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that even in the face of tragedy, the Lizard acknowledges their friendship with Zoe, which aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

5. **Zoe dies due to the eruption.**  
   - This is the final outcome of the story, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying as a result of the volcano erupting.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard maintains the friendship they established earlier.
