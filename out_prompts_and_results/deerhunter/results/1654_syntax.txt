To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank to get the money. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba feels hungry and decides to eat. This action is included to show Bubba's state of mind and his need to satisfy his hunger, although it does not directly affect the outcome of the story.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Although Bambi is already dead, this action signifies that Bubba is consuming the deer he shot earlier. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking advantage of the situation and utilizing the resources available to him.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to get the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to steal money from the bank clerk.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger after the robbery.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, confirming that he has taken advantage of the situation.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead.
