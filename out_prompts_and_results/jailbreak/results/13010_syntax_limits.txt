**Story Completion:**

After successfully disguising himself in civilian clothes, Roy is on the highway outside the prison. He knows that he has to escape before the guards or the bully can catch him. With the pack of cigarettes in Ernest's possession, the bully is distracted and less likely to notice Roy's escape. 

Roy takes a deep breath, looks around to ensure the coast is clear, and then makes his move. He walks confidently down the highway, blending in with the civilian clothes, and escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: This action is crucial as it allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free. Since he is already disguised in civilian clothes, he can safely leave the prison without being recognized.
