To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which means she has the potential to marry either of them. However, since she is currently in the Village and Vince is in the Cave with the Money, she needs to take action to secure her wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave to be with Vince, who has the Money. This is necessary for her to access the Money and increase her wealth.

2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the Money from Vince. This action is crucial as it directly increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince. This action will make both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

Now, Talia has achieved both her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring the Money).

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Travel to Cave**: Talia needs to be in the same location as Vince to take the Money.
- **Take Money from Vince**: This action directly increases Talia's wealth, which is essential for her goal.
- **Marry Vince**: This action ensures Talia's happiness, as marriage with Vince fulfills her emotional needs.
