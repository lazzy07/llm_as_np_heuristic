In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey also wants the jewelry. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action occurs:

1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex.** This action is taken because Blake wants Alex to be happy, and since Blake does not want the jewelry, it is a straightforward way to help Alex achieve their goal.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake is still not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is still not happy because they do not have the jewelry.

This action is necessary as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
