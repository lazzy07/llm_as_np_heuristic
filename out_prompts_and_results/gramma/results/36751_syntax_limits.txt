In this story, the Merchant's goal is to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal. The Merchant is currently at the Camp, and she has the Medicine and Tom's Coin with her. The Bandit is at the Market and is a criminal, which poses a risk to the Merchant's goal. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Take the TomCoin from the Merchant's location (Camp) to the Bandit Camp.** This action allows the Merchant to keep the coin she has without engaging in any criminal activity, as she is not robbing or attacking anyone.

This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to secure the coin without becoming a criminal, thus achieving her goal of maximizing her coins.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["take(Merchant, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that the Merchant successfully achieves her goal while adhering to the rules of the story.
