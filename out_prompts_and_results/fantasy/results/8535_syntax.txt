To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, as she has already proposed to him. The quickest way to achieve her happiness is for Rory to accept her proposal, leading to their marriage. Since Talia is currently in the Village and Rory is in the Cave, we need to facilitate their marriage by having Rory travel to the Village.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the Cave to the Village to be with Talia, allowing them to proceed with their relationship.
2. **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory accepts Talia's marriage proposal, which makes both of them happy.
3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married, solidifying their relationship and ensuring Talia's happiness.

This sequence of actions directly leads to Talia's happiness through her marriage to Rory, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Rory to be present with Talia, as they cannot get married unless they are in the same location.
- **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory accepting Talia's proposal is crucial for Talia to achieve happiness, as it confirms their commitment to each other.
- **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: The marriage action finalizes their relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness.
