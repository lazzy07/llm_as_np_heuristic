To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is armed with a sword. Since Tom is not carrying any coins, the Bandit will not be able to take any coins from him. However, this action is necessary to establish the Bandit's intent to take from Tom.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will then rob the Merchant, who is also at the Crossroads and is unarmed. The Bandit will take the TomCoin from the Merchant, which will increase the Bandit's coin count.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the BanditCoin from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring that she has the maximum number of coins possible.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by acquiring coins from the Merchant and taking the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp.
