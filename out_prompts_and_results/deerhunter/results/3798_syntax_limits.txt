Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, realizes he needs money to satisfy his desires. He decides to go back to the bank to steal the money from the bank clerk. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba threatens the clerk and takes the money.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger indirectly by ensuring he has resources for food later.
