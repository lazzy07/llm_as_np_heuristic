To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. After shooting Bambi, he can now focus on getting money from the bank clerk. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he shot Bambi and heads to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to get money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba feels hungry and decides to eat. This action is included to show that Bubba is fulfilling his basic needs after achieving his goal.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank.

The actions taken by Bubba are all aimed at achieving his goal of acquiring money while also addressing his hunger afterward.
