To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is greedy and hungry, which influences his next actions.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting to secure the money, decides to shoot the bank clerk. This action will eliminate the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his greed and ensures he has the money.

This sequence of actions leads to the conclusion that Bubba has the money, and the clerk is dead, which satisfies the ending conditions.
