To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, who has proposed to her and is currently in possession of the treasure. Since Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, they can get married, which will make both of them happy. Additionally, Rory's possession of the treasure contributes to Talia's wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action will allow Talia and Rory to get married, which will make Talia happy. Since they are already in the Cave, this action is straightforward and fulfills Talia's desire for happiness.

After this action, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Rory, and Rory will also be happy as a result of the marriage. Talia's wealth will not change immediately, but she will be happy, which is one of her primary goals.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Talia's goal is to be happy, and marrying Rory, who she has accepted a proposal from, will fulfill that goal. 

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
