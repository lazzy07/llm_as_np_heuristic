To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom carries the medicine.**  
   - This action is implicit in the first action since Tom already has the medicine when he leaves the crossroads.

The story is very straightforward because Tom's goal is simply to reach the cottage with the medicine he has already acquired. There are no other characters' actions that interfere with Tom's goal, and he does not need to interact with the merchant, guard, or bandit to achieve his objective.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage while carrying the medicine, fulfilling his goal efficiently.
