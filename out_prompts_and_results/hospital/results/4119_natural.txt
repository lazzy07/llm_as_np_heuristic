**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess the patient to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is taken to treat Ross. If Ross actually has Jarkis, this treatment will be incorrect, but it is a necessary step to attempt to help the patient.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on the other patients, specifically Young, who is still in Admissions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This is essential to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Young has Jarkis, this treatment is appropriate and will help Young become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat the patients effectively. The first two actions focus on Ross, who is already in an exam room, while the latter actions focus on Young, who needs to be admitted and treated. The goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, and the actions taken are the minimum necessary to achieve this.
