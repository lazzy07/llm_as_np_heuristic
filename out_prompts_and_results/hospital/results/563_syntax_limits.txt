### Story Completion

After admitting Jones to Patient Room B, Hathaway returns to the admissions room to assess the other patients. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in the admissions room. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Jarkis. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand the symptoms of the patients and provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in the admissions room. Young has SymptomB, which indicates that Young has Flaze. This assessment is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Young.

4. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics for Flaze. This action is essential to ensure Young recovers and is healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones's symptoms were not assessed earlier, this action is necessary to determine if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis. If Jones has Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
