In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. The current situation shows that Rory has accepted Talia's marriage proposal, which makes them happy. However, Rory is still not wealthy, as he has no money or treasure. The quickest way for Rory to achieve his goal is to take the treasure from Gargax, who is in the cave with them.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **take(Rory, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Rory takes the treasure from Gargax. This action is necessary because it allows Rory to become wealthy, which is one of his goals.

After this action, Rory will be happy (due to the marriage acceptance), wealthy (by taking the treasure), and not hungry (as he is not currently hungry). 

Thus, Rory achieves his goal.
