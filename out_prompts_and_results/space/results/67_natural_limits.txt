Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, surrounded by the rumbling of the erupting volcano. Realizing the danger they are in, Zoe suggests they find a safer place. The Lizard, understanding the urgency, agrees and leads Zoe to the cave, which is a safe haven from the eruption.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** - This action is necessary for both characters to reach safety and avoid the eruption, fulfilling their goal of being healthy and safe.
2. **Zoe and the Lizard enter the cave.** - This action ensures that both characters are now in a safe location, away from the dangers of the erupting surface.
3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in a safe space strengthens their bond and ensures they can work together in the future.

With these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe, while also fostering their friendship.
