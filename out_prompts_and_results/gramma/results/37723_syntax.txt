To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront Tom, who is currently there with the Merchant's coin.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he obtained from the Merchant. This action is possible because Tom is not armed with a sword, making him vulnerable to robbery.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads to return to the Bandit Camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp, achieving her goal of having as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to reach the Market to interact with Tom.
- Robbing Tom is a strategic move to gain coins without needing to engage in a fight, as Tom is unarmed.
- Returning to the Crossroads is necessary to access the Bandit Camp where the coins are stored.
- Taking the coins from the chest ensures that the Bandit maximizes her coin count, fulfilling her goal.
