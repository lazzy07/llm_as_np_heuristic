To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to identify the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary to ensure Young receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

5. **Walk Ross to PatientRoomA**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway will walk Ross to PatientRoomA to assess him.

6. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Ross's diagnosis, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis).

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is crucial to determine the correct symptoms and ensure the right treatment is administered.
- **Treating patients**: Administering the correct treatment based on the assessment is essential for making the patients healthy.
- **Walking Ross to PatientRoomA**: This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assessed and treated, as he is currently in the admissions room.
