The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is stationed. The bandit reports the location of the bandit to the guard, misleading him into thinking that the bandit is at the crossroads. This action distracts the guard, allowing the bandit to return to the crossroads unnoticed. 

Once back at the crossroads, the bandit approaches the merchant and robs her of the medicine, as the merchant is not armed. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit now has what she needs to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
