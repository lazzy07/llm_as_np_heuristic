After the events that have transpired, Tom is in the Market with the Medicine he stole from the Merchant. The Merchant is still alive but unarmed, and the Guard is also present, armed and ready to deal with criminals. Tom, now a criminal due to his actions, needs to get back to the Cottage with the Medicine.

To achieve his goal of being at the Cottage carrying the Medicine, Tom can simply walk from the Market to the Crossroads and then from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This is the most straightforward path to reach his destination without further conflict.

Hereâ€™s the action that Tom will take:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)** - Tom walks from the Market to the Crossroads. This action is necessary as it moves him closer to his goal of reaching the Cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)** - Tom then walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This final action completes his journey to his desired location.

With these two actions, Tom successfully reaches the Cottage while carrying the Medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is essential for Tom to leave the Market, where he is currently located, and head towards the Crossroads, which is a necessary waypoint to reach the Cottage.
- The second action is crucial as it takes Tom from the Crossroads to the Cottage, fulfilling his goal of being at the Cottage with the Medicine.
