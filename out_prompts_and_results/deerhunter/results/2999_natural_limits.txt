Bubba, having just shot Bambi, feels a pang of hunger. He decides to eat Bambi, which fulfills his hunger and allows him to achieve his goal of having 1 money, as he can now consume the deer he has killed.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and by eating Bambi, he satisfies his hunger. Since he has already shot Bambi, he can now consume the animal, which aligns with his goal of having 1 money (as he can consider the act of eating as a form of gaining sustenance).
