In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I1). Currently, Alex is in the dining room (R12) and has the chocolates (I3) in their possession. Casey is in the living room (R22) and has the flowers (I2). Blake is in the dining room (R12) with Alex.

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) trades the chocolates (I3) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I1) while also ensuring that Casey is happy with the chocolates (I3) they receive in return.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey will also be happy because they have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake remains neutral as they are not directly involved in this trade.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
