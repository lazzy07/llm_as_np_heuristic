To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room, to determine his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are evaluated.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary for Ross's recovery.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients receive the necessary care.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients effectively, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is essential to determine their symptoms and the correct treatment. Without this step, Hathaway cannot provide the right care.
- **Treating each patient** with the correct treatment based on their symptoms is necessary to ensure they recover and achieve Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
