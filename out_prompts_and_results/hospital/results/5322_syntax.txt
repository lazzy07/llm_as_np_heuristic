1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake. However, we will assume that Hathaway correctly assesses Ross and finds that he has a fever, indicating Flaze.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics in Exam Room A**: Since Ross has Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which will make Ross healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is also in the hospital. Assuming Young has a rash, this indicates Jarkis.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, which will make Young healthy.

5. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Jones to an exam room. Since Jones is still in the admissions room, we will assume that he has a fever (Flaze) as well.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Jones and find that he has a fever.
