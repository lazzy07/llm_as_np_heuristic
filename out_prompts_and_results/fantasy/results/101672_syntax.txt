To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. Since Vince has money and Talia does not, we can leverage this to make Talia wealthy, which will also contribute to her happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **pickup(Vince, Money, Cave)**: Vince picks up the money he has at the cave. This action is necessary because Talia needs to become wealthy, and Vince is the only character with money.

2. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village with the money. This is important because Talia is currently in the cave, and they need to be in the same location for Talia to access the money.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels to the village to meet Vince. This is necessary for Talia to be in the same location as Vince to receive the money.

4. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth.

5. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry. This action is included to reflect her state, but it does not affect her wealth or happiness directly.

6. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince and Talia get married. This action will make Talia happy, as she is now in a committed relationship with Vince.

By following these actions, Talia will become wealthy and happy through her marriage to Vince and by acquiring the money.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **pickup(Vince, Money, Cave)**: Vince needs to have the money in his possession to give it to Talia.
- **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince must move to the village where Talia is to facilitate the transfer of money.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia needs to be in the village to interact with Vince and receive the money.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the money, which is essential for her wealth.
- **get_hungry(Talia)**: This reflects Talia's state but does not impact the outcome.
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This final action ensures Talia's happiness through marriage.
