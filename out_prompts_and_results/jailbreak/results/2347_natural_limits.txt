**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest, still in the gym, realizes he needs to act quickly to avoid the bully's threats. He decides to sneak through the vents to the hallway, hoping to find a way to escape or at least gain an advantage. 

1. **Action: Ernest crawls through the vents to the hallway.**  
   - *Explanation: This action allows Ernest to move away from the bully's immediate threat in the gym and gives him access to the hallway where he can potentially find a way to escape or gather more information.*

Once in the hallway, Ernest spots the civilian clothes hanging in the laundry room. He knows that disguising himself is crucial for his survival.

2. **Action: Ernest moves to the laundry room and puts on the civilian clothes.**  
   - *Explanation: By disguising himself, Ernest can avoid detection by the bully and the guards, increasing his chances of escaping the prison.*

Now disguised, Ernest heads back to the hallway, ready to make his escape.

3. **Action: Ernest goes to the highway and escapes from the prison.**  
   - *Explanation: This action fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free, successfully overcoming the bully's threats by escaping the prison.*

Meanwhile, Roy remains in the laundry room, unaware of Ernest's actions. He is still threatened by the bully, who believes both he and Ernest are in the laundry room. 

4. **Action: Roy stays in the laundry room, waiting for the right moment to act.**  
   - *Explanation: While this action does not lead to a direct confrontation, it keeps Roy safe for the moment, as he is not in the gym where the bully could easily threaten him.*

**Ending:** Ernest successfully escapes the prison, while Roy remains inside, still threatened but safe for now.
