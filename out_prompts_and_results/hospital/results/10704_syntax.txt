To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Jones again. However, Young is in a different room, and assessing them will help determine their symptoms accurately without risking a mistake. 

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Young in PatientRoomB, we can also assess them in PatientRoomC to confirm their symptoms. This is necessary because Young is assigned to both rooms, and we need to ensure we have the correct information.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. This will help determine if Ross has any symptoms that need to be treated.

4. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: Once Hathaway has assessed Young and determined their symptoms, they can treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their diagnosis.

5. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After treating Young, Hathaway can treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on their diagnosis.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Young and Ross receive the correct treatment, leading to their recovery.
