Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway decides to treat Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze, as it is the only treatment available. This action is taken to ensure that Jones receives some form of treatment, as Hathaway is unaware of the actual symptoms.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated as well, as he is currently in Admissions and needs to be seen.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway again cannot identify the disease. However, he treats Ross with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. This is a precautionary measure to ensure that Ross receives treatment.

In this scenario, both patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring the health of all patients is achieved, even if the outcomes are uncertain.
