To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and take the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money that the clerk had, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while ensuring he remains alive and does not face any opposition.
