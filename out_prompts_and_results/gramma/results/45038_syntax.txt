To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit has just attacked the Merchant, who is now dead. The Bandit can loot the Merchant's sword, which will give her an additional weapon. This action is necessary for the Bandit to be better armed and potentially intimidate or attack others in the future.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins she has just robbed from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins secured in her camp.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins. This action is necessary to finalize her goal of having the coins in a secure location.

4. **take(Bandit, Medicine, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the medicine from the Merchant and place it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is not strictly necessary for her goal of coins but adds to her inventory and could be useful later.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp through these actions.
