In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, as it will make him wealthy. Since Rory is currently at the cave and Gargax is also there, Rory must take action to ensure he can safely obtain the treasure.

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - This action is necessary for Rory to escape the cave where Gargax is present. By leaving the cave, Rory avoids the risk of being eaten by Gargax, which would prevent him from achieving his goals.

2. **Vince gives Rory the money.** - This action is not explicitly stated in the original actions but is implied as a necessary step for Rory to become wealthy. Since Vince has the money and is at the village, he can give it to Rory when Rory arrives.

3. **Rory travels back to the cave.** - Rory needs to return to the cave to collect the treasure, which is essential for achieving his goal of wealth.

4. **Rory picks up the treasure.** - This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, which will make him wealthy.

5. **Rory's happiness increases.** - With the treasure and the money, Rory achieves his goal of being wealthy and happy.

The final story is as follows:

Rory travels from the cave to the village to avoid Gargax. Upon reaching the village, Vince gives Rory the money. Rory then travels back to the cave, where he picks up the treasure. With both the money and the treasure, Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
