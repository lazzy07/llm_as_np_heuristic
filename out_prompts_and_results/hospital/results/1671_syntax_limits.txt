In this story, we want to ensure that Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. To do this, we need to assess Ross's symptoms and treat him accordingly. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Ross's successful treatment:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a fever, he will receive antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B. This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat(Ross)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate medication based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
