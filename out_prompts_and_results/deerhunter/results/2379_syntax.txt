To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money while also considering the presence of Bambi, who wants to stay alive. Since Bubba is currently hungry and has already decided to get money, he will take actions that align with his greed and hunger.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the bank to access the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure the money without any opposition.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will return to the forest with the money. This action is necessary for him to escape the scene after committing the crime.

5. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to eat, fulfilling his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to address his hunger after the events that transpired.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to access the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the clerk to secure the money without opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money, achieving his goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba escapes to the forest with the money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba addresses his hunger after the events.
