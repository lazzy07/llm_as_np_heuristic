The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to take a calculated risk. She knows that the bandit is at the crossroads and that the guard is at the market. The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads, where she encounters the bandit. 

At the crossroads, the merchant offers the bandit a deal: she will give the bandit the hero's coin in exchange for the bandit's sword. The bandit, seeing an opportunity to gain a coin without any immediate threat, agrees to the trade. The merchant now has the bandit's sword and the bandit's coin is still in the chest at the bandit camp. 

With this action, the merchant has successfully acquired a sword without committing a crime, thus achieving her goal of maximizing her coins while remaining within the law.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The merchant walks to the crossroads to meet the bandit, which is necessary for her to negotiate the trade.
- The trade of the hero's coin for the bandit's sword allows the merchant to gain an item of value (the sword) while still adhering to her goal of not becoming a criminal.
