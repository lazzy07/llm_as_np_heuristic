To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the market or engage in more complex actions.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, having just attacked the Merchant, sees Tom in the Market. Knowing that Tom is not armed, she decides to rob him of the coin he is carrying.
- After successfully robbing Tom, the Bandit walks to the bandit camp, where she can store her newly acquired coin in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying coins.
