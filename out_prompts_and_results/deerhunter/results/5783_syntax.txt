To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank, and Bambi is also in the forest. 

Bubba's goal is to get money, and since he is already in the forest, he can take the following actions:

1. **Go from Forest to Bank**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and demand money.
2. **Shoot the Clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate any resistance and take the money.
3. **Pickup Money from Clerk**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the clerk.

Now, let's outline the actions and their purposes:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, ensuring he can take the money without any opposition.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is incapacitated, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal.

Now, here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}
```

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
