To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either threaten or shoot another character.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba decides to get money. Since he is now in a position of power (having a loaded gun and having killed Bambi), he can go back to the bank to take the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes back to the bank to claim the money from the bank clerk.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and fulfills the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is essential for Bubba to be able to shoot Bambi, as he needs a loaded weapon.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the possible endings.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After killing Bambi, Bubba's greed drives him to seek out the money, which is a logical next step.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to physically move to the bank where he can obtain the money.
