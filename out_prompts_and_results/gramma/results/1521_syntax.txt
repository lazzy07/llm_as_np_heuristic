To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to position herself for further actions.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit then walks to the market, where she can interact with Tom and the merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed. This allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coin she just acquired and places it in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first walks to the crossroads and then to the market to confront Tom, who is carrying a coin. 
- By robbing Tom, the bandit successfully acquires a coin without any risk of being attacked since Tom is unarmed.
- The final action of taking the coin to the chest at the bandit camp ensures that the bandit has achieved her goal of having coins stored safely.
