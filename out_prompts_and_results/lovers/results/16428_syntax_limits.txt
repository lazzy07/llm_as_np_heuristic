In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, and Casey (C2) currently has item I3 (chocolates). Since Blake knows that Alex wants I1, Blake can help Alex by giving them the item they want.

To achieve this, Blake can take the following action:

1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action directly helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness, as they now have the item they want.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have I1 (jewelry).
- Blake (C3) is happy because they helped Alex achieve happiness.
- Casey (C2) remains unhappy as they still do not have the item they want (I2).

This single action is sufficient for Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by making Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)"]
