**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is showing symptoms of an unknown disease. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Unfortunately, this is incorrect, and Ross dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones. Jones is still in Admissions, and Dr. Hathaway assesses him. Jones is also showing symptoms of an unknown disease. Dr. Hathaway, still under the pressure of a high workload, mistakenly treats Jones with steroids, thinking he has Jarkis. This is also incorrect, and Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. Young is in Admissions, and Dr. Hathaway assesses him. Young is showing symptoms of an unknown disease. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. This time, the treatment is correct, and Young becomes healthy.
