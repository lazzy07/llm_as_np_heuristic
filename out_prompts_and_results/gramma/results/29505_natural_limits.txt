The bandit, armed with her sword, stands at the crossroads after having attacked the hero. She knows that the merchant is at the market with the medicine, which she desires. The guard is also at the market, but he is unaware of her presence at the crossroads.

1. The bandit decides to report her own location to the guard, knowing that this will draw the guard's attention away from the market. She shouts out that she is at the crossroads, hoping to lure the guard to her.

2. As the guard rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit, she quickly makes her way to the market, where she can steal the coins from the merchant without the guard's interference.

In this way, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she can now rob the merchant without the guard being present.
