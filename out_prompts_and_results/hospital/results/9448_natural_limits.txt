Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C. Since Jones is still in Admissions, Hathaway can assign them to an exam room without increasing their workload. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C, discovering that Jones has a rash, indicating they have Jarkis. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully curing them as well.

At this point, both Young and Jones are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
