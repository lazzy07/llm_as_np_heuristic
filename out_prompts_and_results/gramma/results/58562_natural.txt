The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, decides to return to the bandit camp to secure her coins. She walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the hero's coin in her chest. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** 
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her preferred location where she can store her coins safely.

2. **Bandit places the hero's coin in the chest.**
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible in the chest at the bandit camp.

The story is short because the bandit only needs to perform these two actions to achieve her goal of securing the coins.
