**Story Completion:**

The merchant, realizing that she has the medicine, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the market to the crossroads, where she can keep an eye on both the market and the path to the cottage. 

At the crossroads, she spots the hero, who is still at the market. The merchant calls out to the hero, offering to sell the medicine for the hero's coin. The hero, wanting the medicine, agrees and hands over the coin to the merchant in exchange for the medicine.
