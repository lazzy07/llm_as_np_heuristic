To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the bank and needs to go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially fulfill his greed.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat, and Bambi is a source of food.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat the deer. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to regain strength.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money again, as he is still greedy and wants to increase his wealth.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank to confront the clerk again, as he has not yet achieved his goal of acquiring money.

6. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba will steal from the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to acquire money directly from the bank clerk.

7. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, after stealing from the clerk, Bubba will have the money he desires.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money while also addressing his hunger.
