To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates, which are currently in a different room.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is important because Casey wants to have the chocolates to potentially trade or give them to someone else.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially trade or give the chocolates.

4. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the jewelry (I1) with Alex. This is crucial because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Casey puts down the jewelry in the living room after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps to clarify the state of items in the room.

6. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates in the living room after the trade. This action is also not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps to clarify the state of items in the room.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
