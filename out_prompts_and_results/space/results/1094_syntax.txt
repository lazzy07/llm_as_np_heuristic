1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are not fighting, this action can succeed.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will again make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in each other's presence.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship from the cave. This action ensures that Zoe is safe from the dangers of the surface, including the erupting volcano.
