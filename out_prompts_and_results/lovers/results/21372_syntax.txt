To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Blake (C3) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the flowers (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, which will make them happy.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey (C2) will move to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2). This action is not directly related to Alex's happiness but is necessary for Casey to achieve their own happiness later.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, which will make them happy.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake.

5. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C3). This action is necessary for Blake to be happy, as they want the chocolates.

After these actions, the happiness status will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C3) is happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C2) is not happy yet, but they will be once they have the flowers (I3) or jewelry (I1).

The story is short and focused on ensuring Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
