To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba is at the bank and the clerk has 1 money, and Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk.
2. **Bubba picks up the money.** - After stealing, Bubba will have the money in his possession.

Now, let's outline the story with the necessary actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has it.
2. **Bubba picks up the money.** - This action allows Bubba to physically take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, fulfilling his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba picks up the money."
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Deciding to steal the money**: This is a strategic move for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money since he is currently hungry and has no money.
- **Picking up the money**: This action is the culmination of the previous decision, allowing Bubba to physically possess the money, thus achieving his goal. 

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way for Bubba to achieve his goal in the context of the story.
