To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further solidify their friendship and to ensure they are in a safe location away from the dangerous surface.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe reaffirms her friendship with the Lizard. This action is important as it reinforces their bond and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in each other's company.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship from the cave. This action is taken to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
