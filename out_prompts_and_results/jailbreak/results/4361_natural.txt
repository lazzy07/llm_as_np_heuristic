**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to escape before the bully can act on his threats. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards.

Meanwhile, Ernest, still in the kitchen, is aware of the bully's threats and knows he must protect himself. He decides to move to the hallway, where he can assess the situation and potentially find a way to escape or defend himself.

Roy, now disguised, takes a moment to gather his courage. He knows that if he can make it to the exit, he can escape the prison for good. He moves towards the highway, where he can finally leave the prison behind.

Ernest, in the hallway, hears the commotion from the gym and realizes that the bully is still a threat. He decides to lock the gym door, preventing the bully from coming after him. This action is essential for his safety, as it buys him time to figure out his next move.
