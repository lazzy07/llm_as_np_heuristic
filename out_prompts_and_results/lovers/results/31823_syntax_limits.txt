In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake achieving their goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I3) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I3), making both Alex and Blake happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake is happy because they successfully helped Alex achieve happiness.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.
