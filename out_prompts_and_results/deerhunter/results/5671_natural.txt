Bubba is currently at the forest, having just shot Bambi. He is hungry and wants to have money. Since he has already picked up the rifle and loaded it with ammunition, he can now take the following actions to achieve his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger by consuming the deer he has just shot. This is necessary for Bubba to feel fulfilled and not be hungry anymore.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** After eating, Bubba needs to return to the bank to interact with the clerk and achieve his goal of having money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint.** Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can threaten the clerk to hand over the money. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of having 1 money.

At this point, Bubba has eaten Bambi, is no longer hungry, and has successfully stolen money from the clerk, achieving his goal.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** (Satisfies hunger)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Returns to the bank to interact with the clerk)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint.** (Achieves goal of having 1 money)
