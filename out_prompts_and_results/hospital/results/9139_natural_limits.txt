Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Ross and Jones to the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives medical attention and is assessed for any symptoms he may have. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 2.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** This action allows Ross to be assessed and treated as well. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** Since Young is already assigned to this room, Dr. Hathaway can check for symptoms. Young is experiencing a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze with antibiotics.** This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy. Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated one patient, and the remaining patients (Jones and Ross) are ready for assessment and treatment in their respective rooms.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Admitting Jones and Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to manage all patients effectively.
- Assessing Young is necessary to identify his condition and provide appropriate treatment.
- Treating Young with the correct medication ensures he recovers, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
