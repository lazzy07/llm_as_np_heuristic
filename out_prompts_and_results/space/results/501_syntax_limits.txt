Zoe, having just arrived at the cave, realizes that the Lizard is still on the surface and in danger due to the erupting volcano. She decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure their safety and to foster a friendship. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the need for cooperation to survive the volcanic eruption. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe and the Lizard are making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, still on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies. This action concludes the story with a character dying, fulfilling one of the possible endings.

The story ends with Zoe having made peace with the Lizard, but unfortunately, the Lizard does not survive the eruption.
