Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money to satisfy his hunger. He is currently in the forest, where he spots Bambi, the deer. Bubba picks up his rifle and loads it with ammunition, preparing to shoot Bambi. 

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to be able to shoot Bambi. Without loading the rifle, he cannot threaten or kill Bambi to obtain food.
   
2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which he can then eat. By shooting Bambi, he satisfies his hunger and achieves his goal of having food.

After these actions, Bubba has successfully killed Bambi and can now eat, fulfilling his immediate need.
