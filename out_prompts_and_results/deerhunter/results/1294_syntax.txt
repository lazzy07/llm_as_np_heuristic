To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to encounter Bambi, who is a potential target for Bubba's greed.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the Forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which will enable him to eat and satisfy his hunger, while also potentially leading to obtaining money.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat the deer. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is one of his immediate needs.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money. This action reflects Bubba's greed and aligns with his goal of acquiring wealth.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will then return to the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to be in a location where he can interact with the Clerk again.

6. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will steal the money from the Clerk while he is still armed with the rifle. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and greed while also achieving his goal of acquiring money.
