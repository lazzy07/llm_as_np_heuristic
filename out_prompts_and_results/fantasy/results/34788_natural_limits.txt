**Story Completion:**

After Rory picks up the treasure, Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Rory. This action is motivated by Gargax's desire to satisfy his hunger, as he does not care about happiness or wealth. 

Once Gargax eats Rory, Talia, who is now alone in the cave, picks up the treasure that Rory had. This action allows Talia to become wealthy, as she now possesses the treasure. With the treasure in her possession, Talia feels a sense of accomplishment and happiness, fulfilling her desire to be happy and wealthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy his hunger. It also removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to take the treasure without any competition.
   
2. **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of becoming wealthy. By acquiring the treasure, she also feels happy, as it aligns with her desires.
