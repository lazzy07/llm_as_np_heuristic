To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the Bandit prefers to be at the camp to achieve her goal.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action directly fulfills her goal of having coins.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to access the coins stored there, which is essential for her to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
- The Bandit then takes the coins from the chest, which completes her objective.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)",
    "take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins.
