**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, first admits Jones to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Ross dies.

Then, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Flaze due to the absence of a rash. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment, and Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to check on Jones. Hathaway assesses Jones and finds that he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, and Jones becomes healthy.

In the end, all patients except Ross are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring the health of the remaining patients.
