Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to understand what symptoms Jones is experiencing. Since Jones is currently experiencing "Unknown," this assessment will help identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. 

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to provide the correct treatment (antibiotics) for Jones's condition. Successfully treating Jones will ensure that he becomes healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of having all hospital patients healthy.

With these two actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, who is now healthy, and thus achieves their goal.
