To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway currently has a workload of 3, which means they might make a mistake if they treat without assessing.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis, which will make him healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young is also treated correctly.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze, which will make him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are healthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: This action treats Ross for Jarkis if he has a rash, making him healthy.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, Admissions)**: This action treats Young for Flaze if he has a fever, making him healthy.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully treats both Ross and Young, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
