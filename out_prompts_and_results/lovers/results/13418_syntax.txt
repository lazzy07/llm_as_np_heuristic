To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to access the jewelry, which is believed to be there.
2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room.
3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room (R22) with the jewelry.
4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2), making Blake happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to access the jewelry, which is believed to be in the dining room.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey needs to pick up the jewelry to give it to Blake, as it is the item Blake wants to be happy.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey must return to the living room to give the jewelry to Blake.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they will have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
