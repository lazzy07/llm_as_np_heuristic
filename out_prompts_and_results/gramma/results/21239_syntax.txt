To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently in the market and is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will take the coin from Tom and then walk to the bandit camp to place the coin in the chest. This action ensures that the bandit has coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary because it allows the bandit to acquire a coin without any risk of retaliation from Tom, who is already dead and cannot defend himself. 
- The second action is essential for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, which is one of her goals.
