To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross and determining his symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his diagnosis. This is crucial for Ross's health.
