Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are currently safe but aware that the surface is dangerous. To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to ensure they both leave the dangerous surface.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to move to a safer location where they can continue to build their friendship without the immediate danger of the surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it keeps both characters together in a safe environment, allowing them to bond further.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it fulfills Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy in their new relationship.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship from the cave. This action is necessary for her to ensure her safety and health, as the spaceship provides a secure environment away from the dangers of the planet's surface.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
