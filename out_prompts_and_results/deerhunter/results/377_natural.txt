Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. He sees Bambi, a deer, and decides to shoot her to satisfy his hunger. After shooting Bambi, he can eat her, which will alleviate his hunger. 

Next, Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the clerk. Since he has the rifle loaded, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money to Bubba. 

Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money and is no longer hungry.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba shoots Bambi (to satisfy his hunger).
2. Bubba eats Bambi (to alleviate his hunger).
3. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank (to confront the clerk).
4. Bubba threatens the clerk with the rifle (to get the money).
5. Bubba takes the money from the clerk (to achieve his goal).

Each action is necessary to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of having money while also addressing his hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
