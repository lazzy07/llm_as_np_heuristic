To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her goals and the available resources. Since Talia is already married to Rory, she has achieved a level of happiness. However, she is currently without money or treasure, which are essential for her to become wealthy. 

The key actions will involve Talia and Rory working together to acquire the treasure in the cave, as Gargax is currently hungry and may pose a threat. Vince, who is in the village with the money, can be involved later to help Talia achieve her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's goals:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure in the cave.** This action is crucial because it directly contributes to Talia's wealth. 
2. **Gargax eats Rory.** This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and poses a threat to Talia. By removing Rory, Talia will be alone but can still focus on her goals.
3. **Talia travels to the village.** This action allows Talia to leave the cave and go to the village where she can interact with Vince.
4. **Talia proposes marriage to Vince.** This action is a strategic move to secure a relationship that could help her in the future, as Vince has money.
5. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.** This action ensures that Talia's happiness is maintained through a new relationship.
6. **Talia and Vince get married.** This final action solidifies Talia's happiness and allows her to potentially access Vince's wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)** - Talia acquires the treasure, increasing her wealth.
2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)** - Gargax eats Rory, removing a potential threat to Talia.
3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)** - Talia moves to the village to interact with Vince.
4. **propose(Talia, Vince, Village)** - Talia proposes to Vince to secure a relationship that could help her.
5. **accept(Vince, Talia, Village)** - Vince accepts Talia's proposal, ensuring her happiness.
6. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)** - Talia and Vince get married, solidifying her happiness.

By the end of these actions, Talia will be happy through her marriage to Vince, and she will have the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.
