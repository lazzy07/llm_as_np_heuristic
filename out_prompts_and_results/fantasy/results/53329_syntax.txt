To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels to the cave where Rory is located. This is necessary because Gargax needs to confront Rory to obtain the treasure.

2. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax takes the treasure from Rory. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can fulfill this goal.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry after taking the treasure. This action is included to reflect Gargax's state of hunger, which is a part of their goal to not be hungry.

4. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Rory is the only available target in the cave.

After these actions, Gargax will have the treasure, fulfilling their goal of being wealthy, and by eating Rory, Gargax will no longer be hungry.
