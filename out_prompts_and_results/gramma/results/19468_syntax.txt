To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can safely travel there without being hindered by the guard or any other character. Given the current situation, Tom has already robbed the medicine from the merchant and is now at the crossroads. The guard is at the market, and the bandit has been killed, so there are no immediate threats.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead Tom to his goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk directly from the crossroads to the cottage, carrying the medicine. This action is necessary as it moves Tom to his desired location while fulfilling his goal of being at the cottage.

This is the only action needed because Tom is already carrying the medicine, and there are no threats or obstacles in his way.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it allows Tom to reach his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. Since the guard is at the market and the bandit is no longer a threat, Tom can safely make this journey without any interference.
