To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse.** This action allows the bandit to take the medicine and any coins the merchant may have had, which helps the bandit accumulate wealth without needing to rob another character.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can store her coins safely in the chest.

3. **The bandit places the coins in the chest.** This action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting the merchant's corpse** is necessary because it allows the bandit to gain items (potentially coins) without further conflict, as the merchant is already dead.
- **Walking to the bandit camp** is essential for the bandit to secure her gains and return to her preferred location.
- **Placing the coins in the chest** fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins stored safely, which is a key part of her objective.
