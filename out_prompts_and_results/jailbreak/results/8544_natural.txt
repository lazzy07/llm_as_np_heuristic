**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest realizes that he needs to protect himself and Roy from the bully's threats. He decides to take action.

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where the bully is and to potentially lock him in.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape and is unable to threaten them further.)
3. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Ernest to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
4. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for Ernest to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Ernest and Roy's safety.)
6. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to escape without being recognized.)
7. **Ernest goes to the highway.** (This is the final step for Ernest to escape the prison.)

At the end of these actions, Ernest has successfully eliminated the threat of the bully and is now disguised, ready to escape the prison.
