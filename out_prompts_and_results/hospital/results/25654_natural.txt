**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (Hathaway needs to assess and admit Young, who is currently in Admissions.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B. (This action assigns Young to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat them.)
3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B. (Hathaway needs to assess Young in their assigned room.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Unknown. (Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide appropriate treatment.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. (Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway assumes they might have Jarkis, which requires steroids for treatment.)
6. Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 1 (after treating Young). (This ensures Hathaway is not overloaded and can continue to treat patients effectively.)
7. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A. (Hathaway needs to return to Ross to treat him.)
8. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. (Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze, which requires antibiotics for treatment.)
9. Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 0 (after treating Ross). (This means Hathaway has successfully treated both patients and is not overloaded.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is necessary to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat both Young and Ross effectively. By moving between rooms and admitting Young, Hathaway can manage their workload and ensure that both patients receive the appropriate treatment for their conditions. The assumption made during Young's treatment is a calculated risk, as Hathaway has no other information to guide them.
