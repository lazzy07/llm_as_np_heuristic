**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him, but he decides to treat him for Flaze, as it is the only disease he can consider at this moment. Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics to Jones. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also in Patient Room A. Young is experiencing Unknown as well, so Dr. Hathaway again treats him for Flaze, administering antibiotics. 

After treating both patients, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. He assesses Ross, who is experiencing Unknown, and treats him for Jarkis, administering steroids.

All three patients are treated, and since Dr. Hathaway's treatments were appropriate for the symptoms he assumed, all patients become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, even though they are unknown. It is the first step in the treatment process.
2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Since Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the exact disease, he treats Jones for Flaze, which is a reasonable assumption given the circumstances.
3. **Assess Young**: Similar to Jones, assessing Young is necessary to determine his symptoms, even though they are unknown.
4. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze as well, following the same logic as with Jones.
5. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway needs to return to Admissions to admit Ross, which is necessary for him to receive treatment.
6. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, even though they are unknown.
7. **Treat Ross with steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.
