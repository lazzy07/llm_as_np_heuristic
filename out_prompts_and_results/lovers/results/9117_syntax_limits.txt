In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the chocolates (I3). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake achieving their goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve happiness.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the chocolates, making Alex happy.
