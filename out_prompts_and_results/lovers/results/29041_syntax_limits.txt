In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy. However, the jewelry is currently in the same room (R22) as Alex, Blake (C2), and Casey (C3). Since Alex believes that Casey wants the chocolates (I2), and Casey has put down the jewelry, Alex can simply pick up the jewelry to achieve their goal.
