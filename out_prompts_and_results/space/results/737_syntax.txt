To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to engage with the Lizard in a safe environment away from the dangers of the erupting volcano.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters are no longer in conflict, which aligns with their mutual goals of safety and friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, the Lizard walks to the surface to join Zoe. This action is important as it allows the Lizard to stay close to Zoe, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring they can support each other.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now friends and have moved to a safer location (the cave), they are not harmed. This action is included to show the danger of the environment and the importance of their friendship in ensuring their safety.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
