To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment plan.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary to identify the correct treatment for Young.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also receives the necessary care.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment. This ensures Young's health as well.
