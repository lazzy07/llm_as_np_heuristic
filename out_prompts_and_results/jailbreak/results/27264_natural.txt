**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to take action.

3. **Roy tells Ernest about the plan to escape.** (This action is crucial for ensuring that both characters can leave together.)
4. **Roy and Ernest move to the hallway.** (They need to be in a safe location to execute their escape.)
5. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from following them and ensures their safety.)
6. **Roy and Ernest sneak through the vents to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)
