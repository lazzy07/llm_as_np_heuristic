The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the crossroads to the market. There, she finds the guard, who is still at the market. The bandit attacks the guard, killing him. With the guard dead, the bandit now has the opportunity to loot the guard's sword and any coins he may have had. 

Now, the bandit walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely return to her camp. She places the coins she took from the guard into her chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest.
