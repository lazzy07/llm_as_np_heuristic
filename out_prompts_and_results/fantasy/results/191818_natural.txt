To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.** (This action is necessary because Vince needs to acquire the treasure, which will contribute to Rory's wealth.)
2. **Gargax eats Vince.** (This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Rory to take the treasure without any competition.)
3. **Rory takes the treasure from Vince's dead body.** (This action allows Rory to gain the treasure, which will increase their wealth.)
4. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's dead body.** (This action allows Rory to gain the money, further increasing their wealth.)
5. **Rory's happiness increases to 1.** (This is a result of Rory now having both the treasure and the money, fulfilling their goal of being wealthy and happy.)

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Vince picks up the treasure.",
    "Gargax eats Vince.",
    "Rory takes the treasure from Vince's dead body.",
    "Rory picks up the money from Vince's dead body."
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Vince picks up the treasure:** This action is crucial as it sets up the scenario for Rory to later take the treasure after Vince is removed from the equation.
- **Gargax eats Vince:** This action eliminates Vince, who is a competitor for the treasure and money, allowing Rory to claim both items without opposition.
- **Rory takes the treasure from Vince's dead body:** This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, which is essential for achieving wealth.
- **Rory picks up the money from Vince's dead body:** This action allows Rory to gain the money, which is also necessary for achieving wealth.

By following this sequence of actions, Rory successfully achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
