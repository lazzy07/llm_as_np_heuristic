Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. The Lizard, the guardian of the surface, approaches her, sensing the threat to both their safety. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows both characters to stop being enemies and work together towards a common goal: safety. By making peace, they can communicate and collaborate rather than fight.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action is necessary to escape the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface. The cave is a safer location where they can avoid the lava and ash.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** After reaching the cave, they solidify their newfound alliance by becoming friends. This action ensures that they can trust each other and work together in the future.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave until the eruption is over.** This action is implied as they remain in the cave, ensuring their safety until the danger has passed.

Through these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also forming a friendship.
