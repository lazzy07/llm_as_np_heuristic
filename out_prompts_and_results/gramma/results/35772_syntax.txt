To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of his coin. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Crossroads with a coin. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can successfully rob him.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step to increase the Bandit's coin count, as she needs to acquire coins to fulfill her goal.
- **Walking to Camp**: This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her loot and return to her preferred location.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully stored the coins, achieving her goal.
