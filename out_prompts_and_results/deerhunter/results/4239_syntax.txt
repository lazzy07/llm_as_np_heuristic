To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is hungry but also greedy, which drives his actions. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly addresses Bubba's greed and allows him to acquire money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and return to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his position and possibly eat later.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba will decide to eat, fulfilling his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba's survival and well-being after the stressful encounter.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger and utilize the resources available to him.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **steal**: Bubba steals money from the clerk, achieving his goal of acquiring money.
2. **go**: Bubba returns to the house to secure his position.
3. **decide_to_eat**: Bubba decides to eat, addressing his hunger.
4. **eat**: Bubba eats Bambi, fulfilling his hunger.
