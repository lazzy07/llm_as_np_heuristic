### Story Completion

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room C with a workload of 3. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.
   
2. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway returns to Patient Room C to assess Ross. This is crucial to identify Ross's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway then walks back to the Admissions room to assess Jones. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. However, since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. In this case, Ross actually has Jarkis, but due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly treats him for Flaze. Unfortunately, this results in Ross's death.
