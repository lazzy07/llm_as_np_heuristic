Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Walk from Patient Room C to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess and treat the remaining patients, Jones and Ross, who are still experiencing unknown symptoms. This action is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients receive the care they need.

By assessing and treating Young, Dr. Hathaway successfully helps one patient become healthy. The next steps would involve assessing and treating the other patients, but the story focuses on the immediate actions that lead to a successful outcome for one patient.
