To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already in the bank and has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and ensure he can take the money without resistance. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to secure the money without the risk of the clerk calling for help or retaliating.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to remove the bank clerk as a threat, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action is taken to collect the money that Bubba desires, thus achieving his goal.
