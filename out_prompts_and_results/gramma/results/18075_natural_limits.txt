To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because Tom needs to reach the market to interact with the merchant, who has the medicine.

2. **Tom buys the medicine from the merchant using his coin.**  
   - This action allows Tom to acquire the medicine, which is his goal. The merchant is willing to sell the medicine for a coin, and since Tom has one, this transaction can occur.

3. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - This final action brings Tom back to the cottage, fulfilling his goal of being there with the medicine.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome with minimal actions.
