To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. It increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: This action allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is currently unassessed, this step is crucial for identifying the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Assuming Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate medication. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (a fever), Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross to confirm their symptoms. Since Ross has already been assessed with SymptomB, we can assume it is also Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
