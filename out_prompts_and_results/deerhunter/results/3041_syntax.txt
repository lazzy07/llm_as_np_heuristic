To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, who is now dead. Bubba is also hungry and has decided to get money. The bank clerk is still alive and is at the bank with some money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, as she is dead. This action satisfies his hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal without the distraction of hunger.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and obtain the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk using his rifle. Since he has a loaded gun, he can successfully take the money from the clerk.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is already implied in the previous steps, as Bubba's actions are driven by his greed for money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his goal of obtaining money.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
