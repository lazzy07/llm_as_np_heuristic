The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She approaches the guard, who is also armed, and reports her own location as being at the market. The guard, believing the bandit is at the market, is now aware of her presence. However, the bandit is cunning and knows that the guard is focused on her. 

The bandit then quickly walks to the chest at the bandit camp, where she has coins stored. She retrieves the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Report Location to Guard**: The bandit reports her location to the guard to distract him and assert her presence, ensuring he is aware of her and not focused on any other potential threats.
2. **Walk to Bandit Camp**: The bandit walks to the bandit camp to retrieve the coins from the chest, which is her ultimate goal.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to successfully achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible without engaging in further conflict.
