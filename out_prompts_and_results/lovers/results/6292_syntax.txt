To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** This action is necessary because it will lead Casey to believe that Alex is the one who needs the jewelry, prompting Casey to take action to help Alex.
   
   - Action: `tell(Blake, Casey, I3, R21)`

2. **Casey moves to the living room.** This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex, where they can interact and potentially help each other.

   - Action: `move(Casey, R21, R12)`

3. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Alex.** Since Casey believes that Alex wants the jewelry, they will take it from Alex, which will make Casey happy.

   - Action: `pick_up(Casey, I3, R12)`

4. **Casey moves back to the dining room.** This action is necessary for Casey to be in a different room after picking up the jewelry, allowing for a sense of accomplishment.

   - Action: `move(Casey, R12, R21)`

5. **Casey puts down the jewelry in the dining room.** This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but serves to show that Casey has achieved their goal and can now enjoy the jewelry.

   - Action: `put_down(Casey, I3, R21)`

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry, which influences Casey's belief and actions.
2. Casey moves to the living room to be closer to Alex.
3. Casey picks up the jewelry, fulfilling their desire.
4. Casey moves back to the dining room, signifying a transition after achieving their goal.
5. Casey puts down the jewelry, demonstrating their success in obtaining what they wanted.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(Blake, Casey, I3, R21)",
    "move(Casey, R21, R12)",
    "pick_up(Casey, I3, R12)",
    "move(Casey, R12, R21)",
    "put_down(Casey, I3, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
