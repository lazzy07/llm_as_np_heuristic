To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Blake engaged in the narrative.

4. **move(C1, R22, R11)**: Alex moves to the bedroom. This action is also not necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for a potential future interaction with the other characters.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
