In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered. Alex, wanting the flowers, is not happy because they are with Blake. Blake, who wants the chocolates, is also not happy because they do not have them. Casey is happy with the jewelry they possess.

To help Blake achieve their goal, Blake decides to take action. Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the bathroom, which is a lie. This misdirection leads Alex to believe that the chocolates are indeed in the bathroom, prompting Alex to move there in search of them.
