To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a location where she can interact with the hero and the guard, as she needs to sell items to them to gain coins.

2. **The merchant sells the medicine to the hero for the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain a coin while providing the hero with the medicine he desires. The merchant is not committing a crime, as she is selling the item legitimately.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to be at the crossroads to monitor the situation and ensure that no criminal activities are taking place. This action keeps the guard in the vicinity of the merchant and hero.

4. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant.**  
   - This action helps the merchant by ensuring that the guard is aware of the bandit's potential threat, which may lead to the bandit being dealt with, allowing the merchant to operate without fear of criminal interference.

5. **The guard walks back to the market.**  
   - This action allows the guard to return to his preferred location while leaving the merchant and hero at the crossroads, ensuring the merchant can continue her business without the guard's presence.

At this point, the merchant has successfully sold the medicine and gained a coin, achieving her goal without engaging in any criminal activity.
