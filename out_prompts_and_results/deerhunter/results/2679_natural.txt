To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to confront the clerk and take the money. Without this action, he cannot reach the clerk.
  
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

With these two actions, Bubba will achieve his goal of having 1 money.
