The bandit character wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit has already robbed the hero's coin, she is already carrying one coin. To achieve her goal, she needs to ensure that she can keep the coin she has and potentially add more coins to her stash.

Hereâ€™s the shortest story where the bandit achieves her goal:

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp, taking the coin she has with her. This action is necessary because it allows her to secure her coin in a safe location (the chest at the bandit camp) and avoid any confrontation with the guard or the merchant.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit walking to the bandit camp ensures that she is moving towards her preferred location where she can safely store her coin. This action is crucial for her to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
