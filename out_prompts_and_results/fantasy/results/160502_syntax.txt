To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Talia is in the Village, and Gargax can eat her to fulfill this need. This action also eliminates a potential threat to Gargax's wealth, as Talia is a character who desires wealth.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: After eating Talia, Gargax can take the money from Vince's dead body. Vince is in the Village and has money, which Gargax needs to increase their wealth.

With these two actions, Gargax will achieve their goals of being wealthy (by acquiring the treasure and money) and not hungry (by eating Talia).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: This action satisfies Gargax's hunger and removes Talia from the story, who is a competitor for wealth.
- **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Gargax to acquire the money that Vince had, thus increasing Gargax's wealth.
