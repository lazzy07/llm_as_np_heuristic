In this story, we want to ensure that Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, Ross is in PatientRoomA, and Hathaway is also in PatientRoomA, assessing Ross's symptoms. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Ross's goal:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross to confirm the symptoms. Since Ross has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway will recognize that Ross has Jarkis (the rash symptom).
   
2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Ross healthy.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to confirm Ross's symptoms and ensure that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake in diagnosis.

- **Treat Ross**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Ross's recovery. By administering the correct treatment (steroids for Jarkis), Ross will become healthy, achieving their goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

This concise plan ensures that Ross is treated correctly and achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.
