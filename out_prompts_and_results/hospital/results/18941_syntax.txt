To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, assesses and treats both patients, Jones and Ross, correctly to achieve the goal of having all patients healthy. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can still assess and treat both patients without making a mistake.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This action is necessary to understand what disease Jones might have.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to go to the admissions room to assess Young, who is currently waiting there. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to.

4. **Admit Young to PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will admit Young to an exam room so that they can be assessed and treated. This action is necessary to manage Young's care.

5. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Young's symptoms to determine the correct treatment. This action is necessary to understand what disease Young might have.

6. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

7. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is still in the admissions room, Hathaway will assess Ross's symptoms to determine the correct treatment. This action is necessary to understand what disease Ross might have.

8. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
