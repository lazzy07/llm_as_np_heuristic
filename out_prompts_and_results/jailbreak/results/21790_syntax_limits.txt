Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway outside the prison. He knows that he can escape now that he has the disguise. He takes a moment to look back at the prison, feeling a mix of relief and anxiety. With a deep breath, he decides to make his move.

**Action: escape(Ernest, Highway)**

This action is taken because Ernest's primary goal is to be alive and free. By escaping, he ensures his safety and avoids any further threats from the bully or the prison environment.

**Final Explanation:**
Ernest successfully escapes from the prison by using the civilian clothes disguise he obtained earlier. This single action fulfills his goal of being alive and free, as he is no longer threatened by the bully or confined within the prison walls.
