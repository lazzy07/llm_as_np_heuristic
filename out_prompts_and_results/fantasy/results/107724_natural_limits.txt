In this story, Vince's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, he needs to ensure he has both money and treasure, as well as a partner who can contribute to his happiness.

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Vince to confront Gargax, who is at the cave and has the potential to threaten his happiness and wealth.

2. **Gargax eats Vince.** - This action is crucial because it allows Gargax to become wealthy by consuming Vince, who has the money. Although it seems counterintuitive, this action ultimately leads to Vince's goal of being wealthy, as Gargax's wealth will not affect Vince's happiness directly.

After these actions, Vince is no longer alive, but he has achieved his goal of wealth through Gargax. The story concludes with Gargax being wealthy, which indirectly fulfills Vince's desire for wealth, as he had the money.
