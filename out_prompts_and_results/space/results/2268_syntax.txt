Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety and to foster a friendship. 

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to initiate a conversation and attempt to make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures and ensuring their mutual safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks to the surface to join Zoe. This action is important as it allows the Lizard to be in a safer location away from the cave, which is at risk due to the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now friends and have moved away from the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

By making peace, Zoe not only ensures her safety but also establishes a friendship with the Lizard, achieving her goal of making friends with other creatures.
