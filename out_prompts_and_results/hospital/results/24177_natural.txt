**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, first assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway is cautious but believes he can determine the issue. After assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that Ross has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, which successfully makes Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. After admitting Young, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and finds that Young has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making Young healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Jones. Upon assessment, Hathaway finds that Jones also has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, making him healthy too.
