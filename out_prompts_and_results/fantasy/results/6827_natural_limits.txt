After Talia accepts Vince's proposal, Vince decides to take action to achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry. 

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** This action is necessary for Vince to be with Talia and Rory, as he needs to be in the same location to interact with them and potentially share his wealth.
   
2. **Vince gives the money to Talia.** By giving the money to Talia, Vince helps her achieve her goal of being happy and wealthy, which in turn makes him happy as well since they are married. This action also ensures that Talia feels valued and supported.
