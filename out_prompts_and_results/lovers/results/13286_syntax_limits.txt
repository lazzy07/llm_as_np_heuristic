In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - flowers). However, Casey is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2 - chocolates), and Blake wants to help Alex while also ensuring Casey is happy.

To achieve this, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the item they have (I2 - chocolates) with Casey for the item Casey has (I3 - jewelry) in the living room (R21). This action will make Casey happy because they will receive the chocolates they want, and it will also make Blake happy because they will have helped Alex by ensuring Casey is happy.

Here’s the complete story with the action:

- **Action**: trade(Blake, I2, Casey, I3, R21)
