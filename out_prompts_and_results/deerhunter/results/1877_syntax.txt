To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to steal from the bank clerk. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to intimidate the clerk into giving up the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to acquire the money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to distance himself from the scene of the crime and potentially encounter Bambi.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba encounters Bambi. He decides to shoot Bambi, which fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead. This action is necessary to ensure that at least one of the goals is achieved.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money he stole from the clerk, and Bambi will be dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to obtain money without needing to kill the clerk, which is a more strategic move given his greed.
- **go**: This action helps Bubba escape the bank after committing the theft, ensuring he is not caught.
- **shoot**: This action directly leads to Bambi's death, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
