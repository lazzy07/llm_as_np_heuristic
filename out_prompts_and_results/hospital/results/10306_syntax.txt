To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has the same symptom as Jones (SymptomA), Hathaway should assess Ross to determine his condition. This is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Ross.

3. **Assess Young**: Young is also in the admissions room and has a different symptom (SymptomB). Hathaway should assess Young to determine his condition.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Young.

5. **Treat Jones**: Since Hathaway has already assessed Jones and knows he has SymptomA, Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

6. **Treat Ross**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room A, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics as well, since he also has SymptomA.

7. **Treat Young**: After admitting Young to Exam Room B, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, as he has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
