In the village, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are all present. Talia has just accepted Vince's proposal, but she is still not happy because she desires wealth. Vince has the money, but he does not care about being rich. Gargax, the dragon, is also in the village and wants to be wealthy.

To achieve her goal of happiness and wealth, Talia needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. The simplest way to do this is for Talia to travel to the cave and pick up the treasure.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - By picking up the treasure, Talia gains wealth, which is crucial for her happiness.

With these two actions, Talia successfully achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy.
