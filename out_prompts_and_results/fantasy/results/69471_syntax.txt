To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure located in the cave. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax is currently in the Village and needs to travel to the Cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the treasure.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Once Gargax arrives at the Cave, they can pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve their goal of wealth.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is already hungry from previous events, but this action reinforces their hunger status. It is included to emphasize that Gargax is still in need of food.

4. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax can eat Talia, who is currently in the Cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as they need to be not hungry to achieve their goal.

After these actions, Gargax will have the treasure (wealth) and will have eaten Talia (not hungry), thus achieving their goals.
