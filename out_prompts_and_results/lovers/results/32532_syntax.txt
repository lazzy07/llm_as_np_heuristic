To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to achieve their goal.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Casey of Alex's desire, which may prompt Casey to act in a way that helps Alex.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) where Alex is. This is necessary for Casey to be able to give the jewelry to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and potentially receive the item.
- **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: This informs Casey of Alex's desire for the jewelry, which is crucial for Casey to understand what Alex wants.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the final action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.
