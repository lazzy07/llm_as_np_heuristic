To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is essential as he needs to confront the bank clerk to get the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This is the critical action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba decides to eat. This action reflects his hunger and need to sustain himself after the confrontation.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: Bubba returns to the house. This action is necessary for him to find a safe place to eat and possibly hide the money.

6. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which is a reflection of his hunger and the need to consume food. This action is included to show that Bubba is fulfilling his hunger after the robbery.

The story is structured to ensure that Bubba successfully steals the money from the bank clerk while also addressing his hunger. Each action is necessary to progress towards his goal of obtaining money and satisfying his hunger.
