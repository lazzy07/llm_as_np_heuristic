To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront Tom, who is currently there and has a sword. This is necessary for the Bandit to attempt to rob Tom of his coin.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, taking the coin he has. This action is crucial for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This is necessary to return to a location where she can access her chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that she has the coins secured in her possession.

The sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible by first robbing Tom and then securing the coins from her chest.
