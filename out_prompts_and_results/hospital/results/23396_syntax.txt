To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully assesses and treats all patients without making a mistake, given that their workload is currently at 3. The goal is to have all patients healthy by the end of the story.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoom A to assess Jones. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to be in the same room as the patient to assess their symptoms.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze (assuming Jones has Flaze). This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

4. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoom B to assess Ross. This is necessary for the same reason as before.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis (assuming Ross has Jarkis). This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

7. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoom C to assess Young. This is necessary for the same reason as before.

8. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

9. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis (assuming Young has Jarkis). This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway successfully treats all patients without making any mistakes, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
