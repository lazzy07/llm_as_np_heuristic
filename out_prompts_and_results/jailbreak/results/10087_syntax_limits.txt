**Story Completion:**

After successfully disguising himself in civilian clothes on the highway, Roy realizes that he has a chance to escape the prison. He knows that Ernest is still in the cell block and is threatened by the bully. To ensure his own safety and to help his friend, Roy decides to take action.

**Action:**
- **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Roy uses his disguise to blend in and walks away from the prison, successfully escaping to freedom.

This action is crucial because it allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free, while also ensuring that he is no longer threatened by the bully. Since Roy is already disguised, he can leave without drawing attention to himself.
