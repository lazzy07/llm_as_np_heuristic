To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe teleports from the Surface to the Ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the dangerous environment of the surface, where the volcano has begun to erupt. Although this action makes the Lizard angry, it is essential for Zoe's safety.

2. **Lizard walks from the Surface to the Cave**: The Lizard needs to find a safe location away from the erupting volcano. The cave provides a safer environment for the Lizard.

3. **Zoe teleports from the Ship to the Cave**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe returns to the cave to reconnect with the Lizard. This action is crucial for maintaining their friendship and ensuring that both characters can work together.

4. **Zoe and Lizard make peace in the Cave**: This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that they are no longer enemies. It is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of making friends.

5. **Lizard and Zoe walk together from the Cave to the Surface**: They return to the surface together, demonstrating their friendship and mutual support.

6. **Lizard begins to erupt the volcano**: The Lizard can control the volcano's eruption, ensuring that it is a controlled event rather than a destructive one. This action allows the Lizard to maintain its role as the guardian of the planet while ensuring safety.

7. **Lizard erupts the volcano**: This final action allows the Lizard to fulfill its role as guardian, ensuring that the eruption is managed and that the environment is safe for both Zoe and the Lizard.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
