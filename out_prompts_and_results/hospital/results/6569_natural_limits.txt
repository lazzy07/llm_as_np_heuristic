Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess their conditions. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3, but this is manageable for the next action.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: By assessing Ross, Hathaway can determine his symptoms. Since Ross is alive and has unknown symptoms, Hathaway will be able to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: Similarly, assessing Jones allows Hathaway to identify his symptoms. This is crucial for determining the correct treatment for both patients.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Ross has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy.

After these actions, all patients are assessed, and at least one patient (Ross) is treated successfully, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring patient health.
