**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is in Patient Room A, Hathaway can assess him to see if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - If Ross has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, he is not at risk of making a mistake in diagnosis.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on the other patients, Jones and Young, who are still in Admissions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms, similar to what was done for Ross.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - If Young has Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy. Again, Hathaway's workload remains manageable, so he can accurately diagnose.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This allows Hathaway to check on Jones, who is still in Admissions.

8. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - This ensures that Jones is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
    - If Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. 

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat each patient effectively, without exceeding his workload limit, which would risk misdiagnosis. The sequence of admitting, assessing, and treating each patient is crucial to achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
