To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is already in PatientRoomA with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If he has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones and Young, who are currently waiting there. This is important because both patients need to be evaluated and treated.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him accordingly. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

7. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on his symptoms, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of making them healthy.
