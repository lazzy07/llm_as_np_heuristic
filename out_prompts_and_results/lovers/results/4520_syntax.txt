To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I1) they want with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire, which is essential for their happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) will still be unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this is acceptable.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by acquiring the jewelry they desire.
