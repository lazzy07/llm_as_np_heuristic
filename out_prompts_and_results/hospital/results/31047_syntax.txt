To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Walk to Exam Room A**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room A to treat Ross based on the assessment.

4. **Treat Ross**: Depending on the symptoms identified during the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis).

5. **Walk to Exam Room B**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room B to treat Young.
