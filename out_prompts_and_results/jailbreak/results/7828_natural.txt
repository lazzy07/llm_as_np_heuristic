**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, having completed his chores in the kitchen, decides to take action to help both himself and Ernest. He knows that the bully is a threat to them both, and he has a plan.

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where Ernest is and to potentially lock the bully in.)
   
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference.)

3. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, maintaining the element of surprise.)

4. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is crucial as it gives Roy the means to defend himself and potentially eliminate the bully.)

5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to feel safe.)

6. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to escape without being recognized.)

7. **Roy escapes to the highway.** (This is the ultimate goal, as it ensures Roy's safety and freedom.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at eliminating the threat posed by the bully and ensuring both his and Ernest's survival. Locking the gym door prevents the bully from escaping and allows Roy to confront him directly. Crawling through the vents and taking the knife ensures that Roy can surprise the bully and defend himself. Killing the bully removes the immediate danger, and putting on civilian clothes allows Roy to escape without being caught.
