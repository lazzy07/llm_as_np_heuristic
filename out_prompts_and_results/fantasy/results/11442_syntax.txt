To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia is already engaged to both Rory and Vince, she can leverage these relationships to gain wealth. The key is for Talia to marry Vince, who has money, and then she can travel to the cave to collect the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal and they get married. This action makes Talia happy because she is now in a committed relationship, and she gains access to Vince's wealth.
   
2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: After marrying Vince, Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located.

3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave, which adds to her wealth.

Now, Talia is happy because she is married to Vince, and she is wealthy because she has both the money from Vince and the treasure she picked up.

### Explanation of Actions:
