To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants item I2 (chocolates), which is currently with Alex (C1). 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and obtain the chocolates.

2. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the item they want, making Blake happy.

3. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down the chocolates in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way to signify that Blake has obtained the item.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves back to the living room. This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way for Blake to celebrate their success.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to get the chocolates.
- **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Blake happy by giving them the item they want.
- **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: While not necessary for happiness, it shows that Blake has successfully obtained the chocolates.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves back to the living room, which is a celebratory action.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex is also happy because they have given away the item they were holding.
