To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and head to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

2. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving at the surface, Zoe attacks the Lizard. This action is taken to create a conflict that can lead to a resolution. Although it seems counterproductive, it sets the stage for a potential friendship after the fight.

3. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard, in response to Zoe's attack, stuns her. This action is necessary to show that the Lizard is capable of defending itself and to create a moment of vulnerability for Zoe.

4. **break_free(Zoe, Surface)**: After being stunned, Zoe breaks free. This action allows Zoe to regain her agency and continue the interaction with the Lizard.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: With both characters now having experienced conflict, Zoe and the Lizard decide to make peace. This action is crucial for them to transition from enemies to friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

6. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both characters. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending disaster.

7. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in a catastrophic event. This action is the climax of the story, leading to the death of one character.

8. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption kills Zoe, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story. This action also emphasizes the danger of the surface and the consequences of their earlier actions.

In summary, the actions taken lead to a conflict that ultimately resolves in friendship, but also results in Zoe's death due to the volcanic eruption. This combination of events fulfills the story's requirements.
