In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and they believe that Casey (C3) has it. Since Alex is in the dining room (R22) and Casey is in the bathroom (R12), Alex needs to get the jewelry from Casey. 

To achieve this, Alex can tell Casey that they want the jewelry, which is a true statement. This will prompt Casey to give the jewelry to Alex, making Alex happy.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This action is crucial as it fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
