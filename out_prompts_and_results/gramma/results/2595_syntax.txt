To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to confront Tom, who is carrying the medicine and has a coin. This action is necessary to reach Tom and potentially rob him.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is unarmed and carrying a coin. This action allows the Bandit to take the coin from Tom, which contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to return to a location where she can then head to the Bandit Camp.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action allows her to store the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.
