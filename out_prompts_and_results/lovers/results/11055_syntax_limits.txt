In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R21) and has not yet achieved happiness. Casey (C3) is also in the living room and has picked up the chocolates (I2), which they want. 

To achieve Alex's goal, the simplest action is for Casey to give Alex the flowers they have. Since Casey is currently holding the chocolates, they can trade the chocolates for the flowers with Alex. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I2) and will still be happy since they have what they want.

Now, Alex has achieved their goal of happiness.
