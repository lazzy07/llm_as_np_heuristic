To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom bought from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go back to the camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to position herself for the next move.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to deposit the coins she has stolen into the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit robs the Merchant to gain a coin, which is essential for her goal of accumulating wealth.
- She then moves to the Crossroads to transition to her next location.
- Finally, she heads to the Bandit Camp to secure her coins in the chest, achieving her goal.
