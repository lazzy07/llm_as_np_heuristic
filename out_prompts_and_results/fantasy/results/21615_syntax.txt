To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted proposals from both Vince and Rory, she can leverage her relationships to gain wealth. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the Cave where the Treasure is located. This action is necessary for her to access the Treasure, which will help her achieve her goal of wealth.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the Treasure. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her wealth.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the Village with the Treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and Vince.

4. **take(Vince, Money, Talia, Village)**: Talia takes the Money from Vince. This action is important because it increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.

5. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. This action fulfills her desire for happiness through a committed relationship.

6. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action also contributes to her happiness, as she is now in a relationship with both Rory and Vince.

At the end of these actions, Talia has achieved her goals of being happy (through her marriages) and wealthy (by acquiring both the Money and the Treasure).
