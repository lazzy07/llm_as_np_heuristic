**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest, still in the laundry room, realizes he is in danger from the bully. He knows he must act quickly to protect himself and his friend Roy. 

1. **Ernest decides to leave the laundry room and move to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to escape the immediate threat of the bully and to find Roy.)
   
2. **Once in the hallway, Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from coming after them and gives them a moment of safety.)

3. **Meanwhile, Roy, who is in the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room.** (This disguises him and prepares him for a potential escape.)

4. **Ernest and Roy then crawl through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows them to escape the prison without being seen by the bully or guards.)

5. **Once on the highway, Roy, now disguised in civilian clothes, successfully escapes from the prison.** (This fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and escaping the threat of the bully.)

6. **Ernest, however, is still in the hallway and is caught by the guards while trying to escape.** (This leads to Ernest's demise as the guards, seeing him without a disguise, kill him.)
