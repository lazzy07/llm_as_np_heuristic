To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and head to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe to the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact further.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story that the volcano erupts, leading to a character's demise.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption results in the Lizard's death. This action signifies that the Lizard, despite having made peace with Zoe, is unable to escape the eruption.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which results in the Lizard's death. The story highlights the themes of friendship and the unpredictability of nature.
