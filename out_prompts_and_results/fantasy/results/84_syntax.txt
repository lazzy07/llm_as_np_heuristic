To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to marry Talia, acquire the treasure, and ensure he is not hungry. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory accepts Talia's marriage proposal. This action makes both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling part of Rory's goal.
   
2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married. This solidifies their happiness and fulfills Rory's goal of being happy.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for Rory to acquire wealth.

4. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action fulfills Rory's goal of being wealthy.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This is a necessary step to ensure that he can eat and not remain hungry.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action is included to conclude the story, as it is the only way to end the narrative with the given characters and actions.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **accept** and **marry** are crucial for Rory to achieve happiness through his relationship with Talia.
- **travel** and **pickup** are necessary for Rory to gain wealth by acquiring the treasure.
- **get_hungry** and **eat** are included to fulfill the requirement of Rory not being hungry, even though it leads to his demise, which is a necessary conclusion in this scenario.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "accept(Rory, Talia, Village)",
    "marry(Rory, Talia, Village)",
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Rory achieves his goals of happiness, wealth, and not being hungry, albeit through a tragic end.
