Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. He quickly moves from the laundry room to the kitchen, where he stealthily grabs the knife. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway, where he can lock the gym door to trap the bully inside.
