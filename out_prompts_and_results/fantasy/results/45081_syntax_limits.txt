To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)** - Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory while he is in the cave. This action is necessary because Rory is currently in the cave, and Gargax is also there. By eating Rory, Gargax will fulfill his desire to not be hungry, and since Rory is no longer alive, he will not be able to pursue his goals anymore. However, this action ultimately leads to Rory's demise, which is a necessary sacrifice for the story to conclude with Rory achieving his goal of not being hungry, albeit in a tragic way.

The story is short and direct, focusing on the actions that lead to the conclusion of Rory's journey.
