Zoe looks around at the dangerous surface, realizing that staying here is not safe for either her or the Lizard. She remembers that they are friends now and that they both want to be healthy and safe. To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can both be safe from the erupting surface.

**Action Explanation:**
- **Zoe teleports to the ship from the surface.** This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to escape the dangerous environment of the erupting surface, ensuring her safety and the Lizard's safety as well. Since they are friends, Zoe's action of teleporting also implies that she can invite the Lizard to join her on the ship, where they can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.
