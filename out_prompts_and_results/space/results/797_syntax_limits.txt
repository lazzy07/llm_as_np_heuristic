Zoe, now safely aboard her spaceship, realizes that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano. Understanding that her goal is to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both of their safety, she decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to assist the Lizard, demonstrating her commitment to friendship and safety.

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and sees that it is in a precarious situation due to the volcano. She approaches the Lizard and speaks to it, trying to establish a connection.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which allows them to become friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and being safe.

Now that they are friends, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to find a safe place away from the volcano.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave, where they can be safe from the eruption. This action ensures their safety and solidifies their new friendship.

In the cave, they can discuss their experiences and learn from each other, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends and ensuring both of their safety.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

Each action is necessary to achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, ultimately leading to a positive outcome for both characters.
