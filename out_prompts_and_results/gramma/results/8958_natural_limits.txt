Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, is at the bandit camp. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine he needs, he decides to take action. 

1. **Tom walks from the camp to the crossroads.** (This action is necessary for Tom to reach the merchant and obtain the medicine.)
2. **Tom attacks the merchant.** (Since the merchant is unarmed, Tom can successfully attack and kill her, allowing him to take the medicine.)
3. **Tom loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse.** (This action allows Tom to finally obtain the medicine he desires.)
4. **Tom walks from the crossroads back to the cottage.** (This action brings Tom back to his desired location with the medicine.)

By following these actions, Tom successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
