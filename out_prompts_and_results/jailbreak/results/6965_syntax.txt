**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, while Roy is in the hallway. Both are aware of the bully's threats and want to avoid confrontation. 

1. **Action: go(Roy, Gym)** - Roy decides to move to the gym to check on the bully and see if he can find a way to deal with the situation. This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and potentially find a way to escape.

2. **Action: lock_gym(Roy, Gym)** - Once in the gym, Roy locks the door behind him. This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference. This is a strategic move to control the situation.

3. **Action: steal(Roy, Knife, Kitchen)** - While in the gym, Roy remembers that the knife is in the kitchen. He quickly moves to the kitchen, steals the knife, and returns to the gym. This action is crucial as it gives Roy a means to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.

4. **Action: revenge(Roy, Bully, Gym)** - With the knife in hand and the gym locked, Roy confronts the bully and kills him. This action is essential for Roy to ensure his safety and eliminate the threat that the bully posed to both him and Ernest.

5. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)** - After dealing with the bully, Roy goes back to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, and disguises himself. This is necessary for him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards.

6. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)** - Finally, Roy makes his way to the highway and escapes from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring his survival and freedom from the prison. By locking the gym, he controls the environment, and by stealing the knife, he prepares himself for a confrontation. Killing the bully removes the immediate threat, and disguising himself allows him to escape without being recognized.
