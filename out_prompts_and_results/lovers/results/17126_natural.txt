To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers and becoming happy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to access the chocolates, which he wants. It is a necessary step for Blake to pursue his own happiness after helping Alex.

3. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to follow Blake and potentially interact with him regarding the chocolates, which is part of the overall dynamic of the story.

4. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is included so that Casey can achieve her own happiness by obtaining the chocolates, which she believes are in the dining room.

Now, let's summarize the actions in the story:

1. Blake gives the flowers to Alex.
2. Blake moves to the dining room.
3. Casey moves to the dining room.
4. Casey picks up the chocolates in the dining room.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
