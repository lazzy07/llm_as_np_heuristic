**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Fever, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Young is the only patient in the room, and Hathaway can correctly identify the symptom as a fever, which indicates Flaze.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Young healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Rash, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in Exam Room C. With a workload of 2 after treating Young, Hathaway can accurately identify Ross's symptom as a rash, indicating Jarkis.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy as well.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary to identify Young's condition accurately, ensuring Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.

- The third action allows Hathaway to assess Ross accurately, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis due to the workload being below three.
- The fourth action is essential for Ross's recovery, ensuring that both patients are healthy by the end of the story.
