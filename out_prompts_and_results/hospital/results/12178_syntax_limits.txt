In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Jones's symptoms is crucial for providing the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will proceed with the assessment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Young will walk from Admissions to PatientRoomC. This action is not directly related to Jones's health but ensures that Young is in the correct location for future assessment and treatment, maintaining the flow of the story.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: To determine Jones's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.
2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: To administer the correct treatment based on the assessment, ensuring Jones's health.
3. **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: To position Young for future care, keeping the hospital's operations smooth.
