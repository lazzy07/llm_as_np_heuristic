To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Alex.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21) after receiving the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to maintain the flow of the story.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
