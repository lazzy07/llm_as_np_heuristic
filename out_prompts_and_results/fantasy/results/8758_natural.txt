To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, but she is not happy. To make Talia happy, we can have her and Rory engage in actions that lead to happiness.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

4. **Rory proposes to Talia again.** (This action reinforces Talia's value and happiness, as it shows that Rory still cares for her.)
5. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal again.** (This action further enhances Talia's happiness.)
