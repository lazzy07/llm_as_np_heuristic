Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant and the bandit. The merchant has the medicine that Tom desires. Knowing that the bandit is a criminal and poses a threat, Tom decides to take action. 

Tom uses his sword to attack the bandit, who is not armed with a sword. The attack is successful, and the bandit is killed. Tom then loots the bandit's sword and returns to the merchant.
