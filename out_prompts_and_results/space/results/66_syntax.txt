To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Since both characters are currently not fighting and are in the same location, Zoe can initiate a peace-making action. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals as well.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave**: After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can walk to the cave together. This action is important because it moves them away from the dangerous surface where the volcano is beginning to erupt, ensuring their safety.

3. **The volcano erupts**: The eruption occurs after they have moved to the cave, which means they are safe from the danger of the eruption. This event highlights the importance of their previous actions in ensuring their safety.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe, and they also establish a friendship.
