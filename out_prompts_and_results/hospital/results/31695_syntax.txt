To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 2, they can assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment Jones needs.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway can then assess Ross, who is also in Admissions. This will help Hathaway identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Young in PatientRoomA**: Since Young has already been assessed and has SymptomB, Hathaway can treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomB (which is Flaze). This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway can treat Jones based on the assessment results. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the assessment results. If Ross has Jarkis, he will receive steroids, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring they are healthy.
