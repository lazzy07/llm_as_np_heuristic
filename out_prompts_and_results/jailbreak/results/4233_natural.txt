**Story Completion:**

1. **Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, moves from the highway to the hallway.**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to the exit of the prison while remaining undetected.

2. **Ernest crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym.**  
   - This allows Ernest to access the gym without being seen by the bully, who is currently there.

3. **Ernest locks the gym door behind him.**  
   - Locking the door prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that Ernest can confront him without interference.

4. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen (this action is implied as he has already done his chores there).**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to defend himself and take control of the situation.

5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.**  
   - This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Ernest and Roy's safety.

6. **Ernest then returns to the hallway and exits to the highway.**  
   - This final action allows Ernest to escape the prison successfully.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to help Ernest achieve his goal of staying alive and escaping the prison. The first few actions focus on stealth and securing the environment (locking the gym door), while the later actions focus on eliminating the immediate threat (killing the bully) and making a successful escape.
