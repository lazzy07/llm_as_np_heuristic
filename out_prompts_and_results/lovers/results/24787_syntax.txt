To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they believe that I1 is with Casey. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room to be closer to Casey, who has the jewelry.
   - **Reason**: This action is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and obtain the jewelry.

2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey follows Alex to the dining room.
   - **Reason**: This keeps Casey in the same room as Alex, allowing for a potential exchange.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the dining room.
   - **Reason**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the crucial action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
