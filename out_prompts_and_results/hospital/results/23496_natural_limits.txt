Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, decides to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. Since Ross is the only patient left unassigned to an exam room, Hathaway admits him to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen.

Next, Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Ross is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Ross healthy.

Now, with Ross treated and healthy, Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to treat Jones, who is still in Patient Room A. Hathaway assesses Jones and finds he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which also makes Jones healthy.

With both patients treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
