Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of a dangerous planet, where a volcano has begun to erupt. She has already made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, which has improved their relationship. However, both characters are still in a precarious situation due to the erupting volcano.

To ensure both Zoe and the Lizard can be healthy and safe, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to find shelter from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to avoid the danger on the surface.
2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, seeking safety as well. This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of safety.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures they can work together to stay safe.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
