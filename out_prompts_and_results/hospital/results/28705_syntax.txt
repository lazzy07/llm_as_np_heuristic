To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential for Jones to become healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients effectively, ensuring they all become healthy.
