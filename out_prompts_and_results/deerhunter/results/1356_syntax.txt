To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a condition that has been established in the story.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After eating the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is included to show that Bubba is moving away from the scene of the crime, which is a logical step after committing the actions above.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the bank clerk to access the money.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Bubba satisfies his hunger by consuming the clerk.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money from the bank.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank, completing his actions.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's goal.
