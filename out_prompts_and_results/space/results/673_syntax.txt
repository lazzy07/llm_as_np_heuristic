Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety while building a friendship.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it allows them to stop any potential conflict and start building a relationship based on mutual understanding and safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave, which is safer than the surface. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are in a less dangerous environment.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures they are both in a safe location.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship further. This action is essential for both characters to feel secure and safe with each other.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making a friend in the Lizard. The story concludes with both characters feeling secure in their friendship and in a safe environment.
