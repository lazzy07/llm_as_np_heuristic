**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest is aware that Roy is in the hallway. He knows that Roy has stolen the pack of cigarettes from the bully, which puts both of them in danger. Meanwhile, Roy, feeling the threat from the bully, decides to take action. He moves to the kitchen to join Ernest.

Once in the kitchen, Roy quickly grabs the knife, knowing that it could be their only chance against the bully. He then suggests to Ernest that they should lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them. They both agree that this is the best course of action.

Roy locks the gym door, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. With the bully trapped inside, Roy and Ernest feel a sense of relief. They know they need to act quickly. Roy then puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself.
