Zoe and the Lizard stand on the dangerous surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent threat posed by the erupting volcano. They have already established a friendship, which is crucial for their safety and mutual goals. 

To ensure their health and safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and find a way to help the Lizard. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, their friendship allows for understanding and cooperation. 

Once aboard the spaceship, Zoe can use the ship's systems to create a safe environment for both herself and the Lizard. She can also devise a plan to help the Lizard find a safer place on the planet or even assist in relocating to a more stable area.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety and to utilize the resources available on the spaceship to help both herself and the Lizard.
2. **Zoe uses the spaceship's systems to communicate with the Lizard.** - This action is implied as part of her plan to ensure the Lizard's safety and to maintain their friendship.
3. **Zoe devises a plan to help the Lizard find a safer location.** - This action is essential for achieving both characters' goals of being healthy and safe.

By the end of this sequence, Zoe has successfully ensured her safety and is in a position to help the Lizard, thus achieving her goal of making friends and ensuring their mutual safety.
