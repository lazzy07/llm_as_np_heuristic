To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk.

Since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he can go back to the bank and steal the money from the clerk, as he has a loaded rifle. 

Hereâ€™s the action that will achieve the goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba goes to the bank and, with his loaded rifle, he steals the money from the bank clerk.

This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to fulfill his greed by acquiring the money he desires. 

Now, let's summarize the story with the final plan:

1. Bubba has already shot Bambi, ensuring Bambi is dead.
2. Bubba then goes to the bank and steals the money from the clerk.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively concludes the story with Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.
