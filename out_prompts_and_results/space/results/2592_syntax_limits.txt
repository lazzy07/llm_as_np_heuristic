In this story, Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous for the Lizard. Zoe wants to help the Lizard and make friends, while the Lizard is also looking for friendship and safety.

To achieve the goal of making friends and ensuring the Lizard's safety, Zoe will teleport to the surface to assist the Lizard. However, the volcano is erupting, which poses a significant risk. 

Here’s the action that will take place:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to help the Lizard. This action is necessary for Zoe to be present with the Lizard, as she wants to make friends and ensure the Lizard's safety.

After Zoe teleports to the surface, the volcano erupts, which is a natural consequence of the ongoing danger. 

The final outcome is that the volcano erupts, and the Lizard, who is on the surface, dies. However, before the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard can bond over their shared experience, leading to a friendship. 

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- Zoe teleports to the surface to be with the Lizard, fulfilling her goal of making friends and ensuring safety. The eruption then occurs, resulting in the Lizard's death, but the friendship is established before that tragic event.
