In this story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard interact in a way that leads to the volcano erupting, while also allowing them to become friends. The goal is to ensure that the story is concise and meets the specified ending.

### Story Completion:

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** 
   - This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the dangerous surface where the volcano is about to erupt. It also allows her to regroup and think about her next move.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.**
   - Zoe returns to the surface to confront the Lizard and attempt to make peace. This action is crucial as it brings her back into the same location as the Lizard, allowing for potential friendship.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.**
   - This action is taken to establish a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends, which aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

4. **The volcano erupts.**
   - The eruption is a predetermined event that occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have made peace. This action results in the volcano erupting, which is a critical part of the story's ending.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the spaceship and back** allows Zoe to navigate the dangerous environment while also giving her the opportunity to approach the Lizard with a peaceful intention.
- **Making peace** is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of friendship, which is a key aspect of the story.
- **The eruption** serves as the climactic event that fulfills the requirement of the story's ending, resulting in a character dying (in this case, Zoe, as she is on the surface when it erupts).
