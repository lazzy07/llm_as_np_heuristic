In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is also present in the living room (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire and makes them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the living room.

After this action, Alex will have the item they want (the jewelry), making them happy.
