To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: Once Hathaway has assessed Ross and identified his symptoms, he will treat Ross accordingly. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

4. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young receive the appropriate treatment, leading to their recovery.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment. If Ross has Flaze, he receives antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he receives steroids.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment. Similar to Ross, he will receive the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

By completing these actions, Hathaway ensures that both patients are treated correctly, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
