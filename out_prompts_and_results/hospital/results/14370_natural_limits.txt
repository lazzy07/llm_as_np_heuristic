Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to reach Young and assess their condition.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** (Assuming Young has a rash, this treatment will ensure Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.
