To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R22) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) is in the living room (R21) and has the jewelry. 

The simplest action to achieve Alex's goal is for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22).

After this action, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is necessary because it directly transfers the item that Alex wants (jewelry) from Casey to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
