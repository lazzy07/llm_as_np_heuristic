To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room as well. This will help determine Young's symptoms and ensure that both patients are evaluated.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room A. This is necessary to treat him based on the symptoms identified.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Similarly, after assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B for treatment.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Since Jones is already in Exam Room B, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross in Exam Room A**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis).

7. **Treat Young in Exam Room B**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young in Exam Room B with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

8. **Treat Jones in Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones in Exam Room B with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
