Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment increasingly dangerous. She knows that her safety and the possibility of making friends with the Lizard depend on her next actions. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take a proactive step to ensure both their safety.

Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action is crucial because it removes her from the immediate danger of the erupting volcano, ensuring her health and safety. By leaving the surface, she also avoids any potential conflict that could arise from the dangerous situation.

After teleporting to the spaceship, Zoe can monitor the situation from a safe distance and plan her next steps to further her friendship with the Lizard, but for now, her immediate goal of being safe is achieved.
