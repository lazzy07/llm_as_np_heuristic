Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both recognize the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface and decide to work together to ensure their safety. Zoe suggests that they should explore the cave further to find a safe place away from the volcano's threat. The Lizard agrees, and they both walk deeper into the cave, away from the surface.

As they explore, they discover a hidden chamber filled with glowing crystals that seem to pulse with energy. They both feel a sense of wonder and excitement, realizing that they can share this experience together. This moment strengthens their friendship, as they bond over their shared discovery.

However, unbeknownst to them, the volcano on the surface has begun to erupt violently. The ground shakes, and they hear the distant rumble of lava flowing. They realize they need to hurry back to the spaceship to escape the impending danger. 

In a rush, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, but the Lizard, feeling a sense of loyalty to the planet, chooses to stay behind, believing he can help protect it. As Zoe reaches the ship, she looks back and sees the Lizard standing firm, ready to face the eruption. The volcano erupts, and the Lizard is caught in the flow of lava, sacrificing himself for the planet he guards.
