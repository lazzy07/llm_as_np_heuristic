To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The bandit moves from the camp to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with other characters.

This action is necessary because the bandit needs to be at the crossroads to potentially rob Tom, who is at the market and carrying a coin. However, since the story requires the bandit to achieve their goal with the minimum number of actions, the bandit can simply walk to the crossroads to prepare for future actions.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible story where the bandit is positioned to achieve their goal of acquiring coins, as they can then proceed to rob Tom or interact with the merchant in subsequent actions.
