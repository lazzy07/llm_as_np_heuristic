To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the Bandit prefers to be at the camp to achieve her goal.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action directly fulfills her goal of having coins.

The Bandit does not need to interact with Tom, the Merchant, or the Guard further, as her goal is achieved by simply securing the coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: This action is essential for the Bandit to reach her preferred location, the bandit camp, where she can access the coins.
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to fulfill her goal of carrying coins, as she takes the coins from the chest.
