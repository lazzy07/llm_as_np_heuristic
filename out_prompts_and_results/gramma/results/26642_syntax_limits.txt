In this story, the Bandit aims to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Given the current situation, the Bandit can achieve her goal by taking the following actions:

1. **Loot the Guard**: The Bandit can loot the Guard's corpse to take the sword and any coins he may have had. This is a strategic move to increase her power and wealth.
2. **Take the Coins**: After looting the Guard, the Bandit can take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that she maximizes her coin collection.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action directly fulfills her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
