To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, wanting the money, will decide to steal from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can successfully steal the money from the clerk.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: After stealing the money, Bubba can go to the forest and decide to eat Bambi, fulfilling the condition of Bambi being dead.

Now, let's break down the actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it sets up Bubba's intention to take the money from the clerk.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
3. **Bubba goes to the forest**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, as he needs to be in the same location to interact with her.
4. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the possible endings.

By following this sequence, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
