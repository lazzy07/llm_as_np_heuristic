In this story, we want to ensure that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing Ross's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, he is still capable of accurately diagnosing Ross without making a mistake.

2. **Treat(Ross)**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate medication. If Ross has Flaze, he receives antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis, he receives steroids. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy, achieving his goal.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Ross is assessed and treated correctly, leading to his health and survival.
