In the village, Talia and Rory are newly married, but Talia is still not wealthy. Gargax, the dragon, is also in the village and is aware of the money that Vince had before he was eaten. Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy, and since she is already happy from her marriage to Rory, she needs to acquire wealth.

To achieve her goal, Talia can take the following actions:

1. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money that was previously held by Vince. This action is necessary because it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is her goal.

2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to find the treasure. This action is necessary because acquiring treasure will further increase her wealth, helping her achieve her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have both money and treasure, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: This action allows Talia to gain the money that will contribute to her wealth. Since Vince is dead, she can take the money without any consequences.
- **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: This action is essential for Talia to pursue her goal of wealth by seeking out the treasure located in the cave.
