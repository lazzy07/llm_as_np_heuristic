In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. The jewelry is in the living room, and the chocolates are currently unknown to all characters.

To help Blake achieve their goal of happiness, Blake decides to take action. Blake picks up the jewelry from the living room and gives it to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to become happy, as they wanted the jewelry. Since Casey is now happy, Blake feels a sense of accomplishment, even though they did not get the chocolates.
