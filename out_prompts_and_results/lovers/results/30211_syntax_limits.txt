In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Given the current situation, Alex (C1) is not happy because they do not have the jewelry, which they want. Casey (C3) has put down the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R22). 

To help Alex, Blake (C2) can simply give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action will make Alex happy, and since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, Blake will also achieve their goal.

Hereâ€™s the action that Blake will take:

1. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they want.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- happy(C1) = True (Alex has I1)
- happy(C2) = True (Blake is happy because Alex is happy)
- happy(C3) = False (Casey is still not happy, but that is not Blake's concern)

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
