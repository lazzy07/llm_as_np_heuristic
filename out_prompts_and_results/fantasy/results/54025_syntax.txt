To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Talia is in the cave, but Gargax travels to the village where Talia is located. Gargax eats Talia, which not only satisfies Gargax's hunger but also allows Gargax to take Talia's wealth (if she had any). However, since Talia has no money or treasure, Gargax will not gain wealth from Talia.

2. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: After eating Talia, Gargax will travel back to the cave where the treasure is located.

3. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax will pick up the treasure in the cave, which will make Gargax wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger. Since Gargax is already in the village and Talia is there, Gargax can eat Talia.
  
- **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax needs to go back to the cave to collect the treasure, which is essential for achieving wealth.

- **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to acquire the treasure, fulfilling their goal of becoming wealthy.

After these actions, Gargax will be wealthy and not hungry, achieving their goal.
