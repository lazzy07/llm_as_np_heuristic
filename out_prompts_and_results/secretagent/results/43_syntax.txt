To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must move to the same location as the mastermind and use the gun to kill them. Given the current situation, the secret agent is in the Office with the gun and the papers. The mastermind is believed to be in the Office as well. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The secret agent moves from the Office to the Lobby. This action is necessary to position the secret agent closer to the mastermind, who is believed to be in the Office.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The secret agent moves back to the Office. This action is necessary to confront the mastermind directly.

3. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the Office. This action fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- The first move to the Lobby is a strategic positioning action, allowing the secret agent to prepare for the confrontation.
- The second move back to the Office is essential because the mastermind is located there, and the secret agent needs to be in the same location to carry out the kill.
- The kill action is the final and necessary step to achieve the secret agent's goal of eliminating the mastermind.
