To ensure the Guard achieves their goal of killing criminals, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Guard moves towards the Bandit Camp, where the criminal (Bandit) is located. This action is necessary for the Guard to confront the Bandit.

2. **report(Guard, Bandit, Camp)**: The Guard reports the location of the Bandit, which is a strategic move to ensure that the Bandit is aware of the Guard's presence and to prepare for confrontation.

3. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Camp)**: The Guard attacks the Bandit, aiming to kill her. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills the Guard's goal of eliminating a criminal.

4. **loot(Guard, BanditSword, Bandit, Camp)**: After successfully killing the Bandit, the Guard loots the Bandit’s sword. This action is not necessary for achieving the Guard's goal but adds to the narrative by showing the consequences of the confrontation.

The story is concise and focuses on the Guard's actions to achieve their goal of killing a criminal. The actions taken are logical and sequential, leading to the desired outcome.
