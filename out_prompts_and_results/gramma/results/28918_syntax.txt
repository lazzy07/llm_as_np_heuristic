To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the TomCoin that Tom is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently carrying a coin.
