In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry), which is currently with Casey (C2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to obtain the jewelry from Casey. 

Here's the action that will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex can trade the item I3 (flowers) that they have for the item I1 (jewelry) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want while also ensuring that Casey is happy with the flowers.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will also be happy, as they received an item they can appreciate.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
