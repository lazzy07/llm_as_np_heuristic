To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will result in one character dying. The Lizard, as the guardian of the planet, is in the cave, and Zoe is currently on the spaceship. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the surface where the volcano is erupting.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important for Zoe to confront the Lizard and attempt to make peace.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, which is one of Zoe's goals.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a continuation of the previous events. This action will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is on the surface when the eruption occurs.

The story ends with Zoe dying due to the eruption while having successfully made peace with the Lizard, thus achieving both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy and safe and to make friends.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the surface** is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him.
- **Walking to the cave** allows Zoe to reach the Lizard and attempt to establish a friendship.
- **Making peace** is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of friendship, which is a key part of the story.
- **Erupting the volcano** fulfills the condition of a character dying, which is a critical part of the ending.
