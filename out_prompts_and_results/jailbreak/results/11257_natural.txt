**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the cigarettes, which could be used as leverage. 

1. **Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to get closer to Ernest and the gym.)
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
3. **Roy locks the gym door behind him.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a moment of safety.)
4. **Roy confronts the bully and threatens him with the knife.** (This is a critical action to assert dominance and protect himself and Ernest.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)

With the bully dead, Roy feels a sense of relief. He knows that he and Ernest can now escape together. 

6. **Roy takes the civilian clothes from the laundry room.** (This action is necessary for disguise.)
7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This allows him to disguise himself for the escape.)
8. **Roy crawls back through the vents to the hallway.** (This action is necessary to get back to Ernest without being seen.)
9. **Roy finds Ernest in the kitchen and tells him about the bully.** (This action is necessary to inform Ernest of the situation.)
10. **Both Roy and Ernest put on civilian clothes.** (This prepares them for their escape.)
11. **They move to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to either eliminate the threat posed by the bully or to prepare for the escape. The locking of the gym door is crucial to ensure that the bully cannot retaliate. The killing of the bully is the climax of the story, as it resolves the immediate danger. The subsequent actions focus on disguising and escaping, which are essential for both characters to achieve their goal of survival.
