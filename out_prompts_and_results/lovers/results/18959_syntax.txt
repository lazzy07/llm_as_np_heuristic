To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R12)**: Blake (C3) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the chocolates (I3) that Alex (C1) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I3) and will still be unhappy, but since Alex is happy, Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy is achieved.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R12)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, fulfilling their goal of happiness.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R12)"]
}
``` 

This is the shortest story where Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire through a trade with Blake.
