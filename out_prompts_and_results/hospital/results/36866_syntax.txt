To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Young has in order to treat them correctly.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Young.
