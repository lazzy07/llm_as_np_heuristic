**Story Completion:**

On day one, Roy finishes his chores in the kitchen and realizes he needs to secure his safety and that of his friend Ernest. He knows the bully is a threat, especially since he has already threatened both of them. To protect himself and Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

Roy goes to the gym where the bully is currently located. He locks the gym door behind him, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, preventing him from threatening them further.
