To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with it and potentially make friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe is in the cave, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which will also help ensure both characters feel safe.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After successfully making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship. This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
