To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on ensuring that Bubba retains his money.

Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, which satisfies the condition of him having the money. Therefore, no further actions are necessary to achieve the goal of Bubba having the money or confirming Bambi's death.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba stands in the forest, rifle in hand, having just shot Bambi. He feels a sense of satisfaction as he looks at the deer, confirming that it is indeed dead. With 1 money in his pocket, he feels accomplished and content.

**Explanation of the actions:**
- No additional actions are needed since Bubba already has the money and Bambi is confirmed dead.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": []
}
``` 

This plan indicates that no further actions are required to achieve the desired outcome, as the conditions of the story have already been met.
