**Story Completion:**

After assessing Jones in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by the fever. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake, but since Jones is the only patient in the room, Hathaway confidently decides to treat Jones with antibiotics.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address Ross and Young, who are still in the admissions room. Since Hathaway's workload is now reduced to 2 after treating Jones, they can safely assess Ross without the risk of making a mistake.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Now, Hathaway can walk to Young in the admissions room to assess and treat him as well.

5. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Young.

6. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis.

7. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, making him healthy as well.
