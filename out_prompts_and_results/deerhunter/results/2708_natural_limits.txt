Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to go back to the forest where Bambi lies. He picks up Bambi's body and decides to eat it, satisfying his hunger. After eating, he feels content and no longer desires money, as he has fulfilled his immediate need.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the forest**: This action is not necessary as it does not change Bubba's location. Instead, he should have gone to the forest to eat Bambi.
2. **Bubba picks up Bambi's body**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger by preparing to eat.
3. **Bubba decides to eat**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is his immediate goal.

Since the goal is to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of satisfying his hunger, the story can be simplified to just the necessary actions.
