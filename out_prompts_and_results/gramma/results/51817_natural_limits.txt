Tom, realizing the danger in the market with the bandit present, decides to take action. He quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, hoping that the guard will deal with the criminal. 

The guard, alerted by Tom's report, immediately confronts the bandit. Since the bandit is armed and the guard is also armed, a confrontation ensues. The guard attacks and kills the bandit, ensuring the market is safe.

With the bandit defeated, Tom can now safely retrieve the medicine from the merchant's body. He picks up the medicine, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard**: This action is necessary for Tom to ensure the bandit is dealt with, as he is not armed and cannot confront the bandit himself.
2. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit**: This action removes the threat from the market, allowing Tom to safely retrieve the medicine.
3. **Tom loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse**: This action allows Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage.
