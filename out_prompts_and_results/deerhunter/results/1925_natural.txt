To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, thus making it easier for Bubba to take the money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be in the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
- **Shooting the bank clerk** is a direct action that allows Bubba to eliminate the threat and gain access to the money.
- **Stealing the money** is the final action that fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
