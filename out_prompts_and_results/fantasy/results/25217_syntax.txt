To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are now married, which contributes to her happiness. However, to achieve wealth, Talia needs to acquire the money that Vince has. Since Vince is dead, Talia can take the money from his body. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she desires wealth.

After this action, Talia will have the money, which will make her wealthy. Since she is already married to Rory, she will also be happy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the money, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.

With this single action, Talia achieves both her goals of happiness (through her marriage to Rory) and wealth (by taking the money).
