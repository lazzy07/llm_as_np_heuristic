**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Jones first since he is already in Patient Room A and has a clear symptom of a rash. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** 
   - This action is necessary because Jones is showing a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Treating him with steroids will make him healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 1. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Ross, who is in Patient Room C.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess him to decide on the appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**
   - This action is necessary because Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the unknown symptoms. However, since Ross is alive, he can still be treated, and this will ensure he remains healthy.

After these actions, both Jones and Ross are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Jones was the first priority because he had a clear symptom of Jarkis, and treating him would immediately make him healthy.
- Moving to Patient Room C was necessary to address Ross's condition.
- Assessing Ross was crucial to determine his symptoms, even though they were unknown.
- Treating Ross, despite the potential for error, was necessary to ensure he remained alive and healthy.
