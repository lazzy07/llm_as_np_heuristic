Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they share a mutual desire to be healthy and safe while making friends. 

To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety and health. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After establishing peace, Zoe suggests they explore the cave together, which is a safer location. This action reinforces their new friendship and allows them to bond further.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave, solidifying their friendship and ensuring both characters are in a safer environment.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, the Lizard acknowledges Zoe's friendship and expresses a desire to be friends as well. This final action confirms their mutual agreement to be allies.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe.
