**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room B, where Jones is currently located. Since Dr. Hathaway is overwhelmed, there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosing Jones. However, Jones, wanting to be healthy, decides to take action.

1. **Jones walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is taken so that Jones can alert Dr. Hathaway about his symptoms directly, as he is unsure of what he is experiencing. By going to Admissions, he can ensure that he is seen by the doctor without the risk of misdiagnosis.

2. **Jones informs Dr. Hathaway about his symptoms.**  
   - This action is implied as part of Jones's movement to Admissions. By communicating his symptoms, he helps Dr. Hathaway understand his condition better, reducing the chance of a mistake.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - Now that Jones has communicated his symptoms, Dr. Hathaway can accurately assess him. This is crucial because it allows Hathaway to determine whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis based on the symptoms he describes.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment.**  
   - After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can now treat him correctly. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This treatment is essential for Jones to achieve his goal of being healthy.

5. **Jones becomes healthy.**  
   - As a result of the correct treatment, Jones is now healthy, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Jones and Dr. Hathaway is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment. By moving to Admissions, Jones reduces the risk of misdiagnosis due to Dr. Hathaway's high workload. The communication of symptoms is vital for accurate assessment and treatment, leading to Jones's recovery.
