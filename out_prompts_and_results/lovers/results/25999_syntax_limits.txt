In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R21)**: Blake (C3) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C2) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex (C1) to receive the jewelry they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex has the jewelry (I1) they wanted, so Alex is happy.
- Blake has the flowers (I3), which is not what they wanted, but they are happy because Alex is happy.

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
