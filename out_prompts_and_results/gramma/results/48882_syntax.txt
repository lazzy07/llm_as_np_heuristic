To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had just bought. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire a coin without needing to go to the chest at the bandit camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to position herself closer to the bandit camp where she can store the coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coin from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by acquiring a coin from the Merchant and then moving to the Crossroads to take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.
