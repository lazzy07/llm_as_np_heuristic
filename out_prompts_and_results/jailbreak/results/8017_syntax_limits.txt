After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest is feeling threatened by the bully, who is currently in the gym with Roy. Roy, having stolen the knife from the kitchen, is aware of the danger posed by the bully. He decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison safely.
