To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. The story will involve Talia marrying Vince, which will make her happy, and then Talia will take the treasure, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.
2. **take(Talia, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: Talia takes the treasure from Gargax. Since Gargax is a dragon and does not care about happiness, he will not resist. This action fulfills Talia's desire for wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Vince) and wealthy (from taking the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Talia's happiness is tied to her relationship with Vince, and they are already engaged. Marriage will solidify their bond and make Talia happy.
- **take(Talia, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: This action is essential for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, he will not fight back, allowing Talia to take the treasure without conflict.
