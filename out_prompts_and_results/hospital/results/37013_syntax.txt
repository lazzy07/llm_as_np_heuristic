To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Jones's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is also in the admissions room. This will help Hathaway understand Ross's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This will complete the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessments, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
