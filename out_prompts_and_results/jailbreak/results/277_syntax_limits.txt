**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest realizes he needs to act quickly to ensure his safety and secure a way to escape. He knows that Roy is still in the cell block and that the bully is in the gym, posing a threat to both of them. 

1. **Action: Lock the gym door (Ernest, Kitchen)**  
   Ernest decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming out and threatening him or Roy. This action is crucial because it temporarily neutralizes the bully's ability to harm them, allowing Ernest to focus on his next move without the immediate threat of violence.

2. **Action: Next day (Day1)**  
   By ending Day 1, Ernest sets the stage for Day 2, where he can plan his escape. The locking of the gym door ensures that the bully is trapped, giving Ernest a chance to regroup and strategize without the bully's interference.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Locking the gym door is a defensive move that protects both Ernest and Roy from the bully, who is a significant threat. This action is necessary for Ernest to feel safe and to think about his next steps without fear of immediate danger.
- Ending Day 1 allows for a transition to Day 2, where Ernest can take further actions to secure his escape.
