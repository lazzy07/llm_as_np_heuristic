After eating Bambi in the forest, Bubba feels a surge of greed and decides he wants to get money. He knows the bank clerk has money, and he believes he can take it. 

To achieve his goal, Bubba goes from the forest to the bank. Once he arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steals the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to intimidate the clerk and steals the money.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where the money is, and the second action directly results in him acquiring the money he desires.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
