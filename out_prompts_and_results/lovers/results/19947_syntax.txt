To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Blake (C3) will trade the flowers (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the chocolates (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C3) will have the chocolates (I3) and will still be happy since they want Alex to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: This action allows Alex to get the flowers they want from Blake, fulfilling Alex's desire for happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
