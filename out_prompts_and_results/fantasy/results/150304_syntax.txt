To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions in the cave where the treasure is located. Since Talia is currently in the cave and has no money or treasure, she needs to acquire the treasure to become wealthy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for her to become wealthy, which is one of her goals.

After this action, Talia will have the treasure, which will make her wealthy. Since she is already married to Rory, she is also happy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures Talia achieves her goal of being both happy and wealthy with the least number of actions.
