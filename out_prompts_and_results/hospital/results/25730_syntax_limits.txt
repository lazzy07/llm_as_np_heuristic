In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Ross, who has been assessed and shows symptoms of SymptomA, which we will assume corresponds to Flaze (fever). Jones and Young are still in the admissions room, and their symptoms are unknown.

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway needs to treat Ross for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently low (1), there is no risk of making a mistake in the treatment.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Ross healthy.

After this action, Ross will be healthy, and Hathaway will have successfully treated one patient.

Now, we will admit Young to an exam room to assess their condition in the next steps, but since we are limited to two actions, we will stop here.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary because Ross is currently the only patient with an assessed symptom (SymptomA), and treating him with the correct medication will ensure he becomes healthy.
