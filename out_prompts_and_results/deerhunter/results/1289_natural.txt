To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as the clerk has the money that Bubba wants.

2. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - Bubba needs to have a loaded rifle to intimidate the clerk and force him to give up his money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is not necessary for the goal, as Bubba should stay at the bank to confront the clerk. Instead, Bubba should stay at the bank after loading the rifle.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

5. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest, ensuring he is away from the clerk.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.
2. Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.
3. Bubba steals the money from the clerk.
4. Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully obtains the money he desires while also maintaining his safety by leaving the bank afterward.
