**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young, who has just been admitted to Patient Room B.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: This is crucial to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but for the sake of this story, we will assume Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Unknown.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B with steroids.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has Jarkis (the rash), this treatment is appropriate. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload back to 2 and ensures Young becomes healthy.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to return to Patient Room A to assess and treat Jones.

6. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Again, we assume Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's symptoms as Unknown.

7. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Jones has Flaze (the fever), this treatment is appropriate. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload to 1 and ensures Jones becomes healthy.

8. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat Ross.

9. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - Explanation: This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. We assume Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as Unknown.

10. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C with antibiotics.**  
    - Explanation: Assuming Ross has Flaze (the fever), this treatment is appropriate. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload to 0 and ensures Ross becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
