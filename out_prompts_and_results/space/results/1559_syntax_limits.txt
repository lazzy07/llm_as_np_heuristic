Zoe, realizing the danger of the volcano erupting on the surface, decides to teleport down to the planet to warn the Lizard. She hopes to make peace with the Lizard and establish a friendship, as they both share the goal of being healthy and safe. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface to confront the Lizard and warn him about the impending eruption.

Once on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and attempts to communicate the danger of the volcano. 

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to improve their relationship.

As they are now friends, they can work together to escape the danger posed by the volcano. However, the volcano erupts unexpectedly.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a catastrophic situation. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can face this challenge together.

In this scenario, Zoe and the Lizard successfully make peace before the eruption, but the eruption itself leads to a dangerous situation. However, since the story requires a character to die, we can assume that the Lizard, despite their newfound friendship, is caught in the eruption and perishes.

The actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard establish a friendship, fulfilling their goals, while the eruption leads to the Lizard's demise.
