To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - Bubba needs to go to the forest where Bambi is located to potentially hunt for food, which will help satisfy his hunger.

2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After reaching the forest, Bubba realizes he needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.

3. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition, allowing him to shoot the clerk and take the money.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money that the clerk had.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money while also addressing his hunger indirectly by eliminating the clerk, who is the only other character with money.
