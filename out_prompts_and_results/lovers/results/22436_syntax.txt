To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where they can interact with Blake.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to trade or receive items.

2. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R12)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Blake for the chocolates (I2).
   - This action is necessary because Casey wants to make Blake happy by giving them the item they want, which is the chocolates. In return, Casey will receive the jewelry they desire.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the bathroom (R21) with the chocolates.
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps Blake to be happy with the chocolates.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22).
   - This action is not necessary for Casey's happiness but allows for further interactions if needed.

5. **put_down(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R22).
   - This action is not necessary for Casey's happiness but allows for the possibility of other characters to interact with the jewelry later.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action allows Casey to be in the same room as Blake, which is essential for any interaction.
- The second action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry by trading it with Blake, ensuring Casey's happiness.
- The subsequent moves and put down actions are not strictly necessary for achieving Casey's goal but provide context for the characters' interactions and potential future actions.
