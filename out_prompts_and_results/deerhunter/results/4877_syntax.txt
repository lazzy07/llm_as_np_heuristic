To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he should also go to the bank to steal from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal from the clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to acquire money, fulfilling his greedy desire.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can steal money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
