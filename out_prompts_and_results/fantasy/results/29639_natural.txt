To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness or wealth. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but she is not happy or wealthy. The treasure is located in the cave, and Vince has the money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **Vince travels to the cave**: Vince has the money and can travel to the cave to pick up the treasure. This action is necessary because the treasure is the key to Talia's wealth and happiness.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure**: By picking up the treasure, Vince will now have both the money and the treasure, which can contribute to Talia's happiness.

3. **Vince travels back to the village**: Vince needs to return to the village to share the treasure with Talia, which is essential for her happiness.

4. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia**: This action will make Talia wealthy, as she will now possess the treasure.

5. **Talia becomes happy**: With the treasure, Talia's wealth increases, leading to her happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Vince travels to the cave**: To collect the treasure, which is essential for Talia's happiness.
- **Vince picks up the treasure**: To ensure Talia has the means to become wealthy.
- **Vince travels back to the village**: To bring the treasure back to Talia.
- **Vince gives the treasure to Talia**: This directly contributes to Talia's wealth and happiness.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:
