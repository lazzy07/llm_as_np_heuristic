To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
