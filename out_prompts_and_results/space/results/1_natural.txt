Zoe, feeling curious about the planet and wanting to explore, decides to teleport from the spaceship to the surface. This action is necessary for her to interact with the Lizard and understand the planet better. 

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe walks towards the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is essential for her to meet the Lizard and potentially establish a friendship. 

When Zoe reaches the cave, she finds the Lizard. Instead of fighting, Zoe chooses to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and make friends. 

The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's peaceful intentions, agrees to be friends. This action solidifies their relationship and fulfills their mutual desire for companionship. 

However, while they are making peace, the volcano on the surface suddenly erupts. This event is a natural occurrence that adds tension to the story. 

As the volcano erupts, Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, quickly teleport back to the spaceship together. This action ensures their safety and allows them to escape the danger of the eruption.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Zoe teleports to the surface to explore and meet the Lizard.
2. Zoe walks to the cave to find the Lizard.
3. Zoe makes peace with the Lizard to establish a friendship.
4. The volcano erupts, creating a sense of urgency.
5. Zoe and the Lizard teleport back to the spaceship to ensure their safety.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, the characters making friends, and both characters escaping to safety.
