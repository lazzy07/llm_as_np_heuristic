To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market where Tom, the merchant, and the guard are located. This is necessary for the bandit to interact with the other characters and potentially rob them.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit robs Tom, who is not armed, and takes the coin that Tom has. This action is crucial for the bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit returns to the crossroads. This is necessary for the bandit to move away from the market and avoid any potential confrontation with the guard.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is essential for the bandit to reach the location where she can interact with Tom and potentially rob him.
- The second action is the key moment where the bandit successfully takes a coin from Tom, directly contributing to her goal of accumulating coins.
- The third action allows the bandit to escape the market after committing the robbery, reducing the risk of being caught by the guard.
- The final action secures the coins in the bandit camp, ensuring that the bandit has achieved her goal of having coins.
