**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess the patient to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is taken to treat Ross. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. However, the goal is to treat all patients, and this is the only option available.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Jones and Young, who are both in Admissions. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 2 after treating Ross, there is a lower risk of making a mistake.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Jarkis, this action will ensure Young becomes healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Ross again to ensure he is healthy after treatment.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to confirm Ross's health status after treatment.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics again.**  
   - If Ross was not treated correctly the first time, this action will ensure he receives the correct treatment. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients effectively. The assessments are crucial for determining the correct treatment, and the treatments are aimed at ensuring the health of the patients. The movement between rooms is necessary to facilitate these assessments and treatments.
