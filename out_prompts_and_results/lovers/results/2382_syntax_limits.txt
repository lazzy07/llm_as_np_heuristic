1. **Trade**: Casey can trade the item they have (I3) with Alex for the item that they want (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they desire, thus making them happy.

Here’s the complete story with the action explained:

- **Action**: trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R22)
  - **Explanation**: Casey (C3) trades the chocolates (I3) they have with Alex (C1) for the flowers (I1) that Alex possesses. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Casey achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.
