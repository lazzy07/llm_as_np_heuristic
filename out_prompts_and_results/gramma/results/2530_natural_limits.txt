Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the crossroads with the merchant, who has the medicine he desires. Knowing that the guard is at the market and the bandit is also there, Tom decides to take action. 

First, Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the bandit's presence, which could lead to the bandit being dealt with, allowing Tom to safely retrieve the medicine.

Next, while the guard is distracted by the bandit, Tom walks from the crossroads to the market. This action is necessary for Tom to reach the merchant and obtain the medicine without any interference from the bandit.

Once at the market, Tom approaches the merchant and takes the medicine from her. This final action fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, as he can now return to the cottage with it.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Tom reports the bandit to the guard to ensure the bandit is dealt with.
2. Tom walks to the market to retrieve the medicine from the merchant.
