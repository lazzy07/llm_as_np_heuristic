Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He knows that the clerk at the bank has money, and he believes that he can get it. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. 

Bubba goes from the forest to the bank, where he confronts the clerk. He points the rifle at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the 1 money he has. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and achieve his goal of obtaining money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not necessary for the goal since Bubba can achieve his goal by simply intimidating the clerk into giving him the money. Therefore, it is omitted.

The final plan is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Bubba goes from the forest to the bank", "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money while keeping the story concise and focused.
