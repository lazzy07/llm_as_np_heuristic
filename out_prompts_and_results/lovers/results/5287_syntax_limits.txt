In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are in the same room (R22) as the flowers. However, Casey (C3) is in a different room (R21) and wants the chocolates (I2), which are also in R21. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the flowers in R22. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.
