**Story Completion:**

As Roy sits in the locked gym, he knows he has the upper hand. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of it in his hand. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, continues to pace around the gym, looking for a way to intimidate. 

Roy takes a deep breath and decides to take action. He lunges at the bully, using the knife to defend himself and eliminate the threat once and for all. The bully, caught off guard, tries to fight back, but Roy's determination and the element of surprise give him the advantage. In a swift motion, Roy manages to kill the bully.

With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a rush of relief. He knows that he can now escape the prison without the constant threat hanging over him. He unlocks the gym door and makes his way to the hallway, where he can finally put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. 

Once disguised, Roy sneaks through the vents to the highway. He emerges outside the prison, free at last.
