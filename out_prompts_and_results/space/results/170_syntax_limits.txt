Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that she needs to ensure her safety and the safety of the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take action that will help them both.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to find a safe place away from the danger of the volcano.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important because it ensures that both characters are in a safe location together, away from the erupting volcano.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, Zoe reinforces their friendship in the cave, ensuring that they both feel safe and secure. This action solidifies their bond and helps them achieve their goal of friendship.

By taking these actions, Zoe ensures that both she and the Lizard are safe from the volcano and that they have established a friendship.
