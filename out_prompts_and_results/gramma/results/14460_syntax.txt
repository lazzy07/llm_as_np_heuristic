To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation with the bandit and the merchant. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom takes the medicine from his inventory.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to ensure he is carrying the medicine as he reaches the cottage.

The story is straightforward because Tom is already at the Crossroads with the medicine, and there are no threats or obstacles preventing him from walking directly to the cottage. The bandit and the merchant are at the market, and the guard is also at the market, which means they do not interfere with Tom's actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the Cottage:** This is the primary action that allows Tom to reach his goal location.
- **Taking the Medicine:** This confirms that Tom is carrying the medicine when he arrives at the cottage.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "take(Tom, Medicine, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal efficiently.
