Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, but they are healthy and safe for the moment. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, and the Lizard shares the same desire.

To solidify their friendship and ensure their safety, Zoe decides to take action. She suggests they explore the cave together, where they can find shelter from the dangers of the surface, including the potential eruption of the volcano.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks from the surface to the cave, taking the Lizard with her. This action is necessary for both characters to find a safe place away from the dangers of the surface and to strengthen their bond through shared experience.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship. This action is crucial as it solidifies their relationship, ensuring that they are no longer just allies but friends, which is a key goal for both characters.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As they are in the cave, the volcano begins to erupt on the surface. This action is included to highlight the danger they have escaped by moving to the cave, reinforcing the importance of their friendship and cooperation in ensuring their safety.

By the end of these actions, the Lizard has achieved its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
