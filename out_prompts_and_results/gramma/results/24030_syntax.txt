To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Bandit robs Tom**: The Bandit, who is armed, will rob Tom to take his coin. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible, and Tom is currently unarmed and has a coin.

2. **Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Bandit Camp to secure the stolen coin in her chest. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

3. **Merchant buys the medicine from the Merchant**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from herself using one of her coins. This action is necessary for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring items without becoming a criminal.

4. **Guard reports the Bandit**: The Guard will report the Bandit’s location to ensure that the Bandit is pursued, which helps maintain the Merchant's status as a non-criminal while still allowing her to achieve her goal.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to acquire the medicine while the Bandit successfully robs Tom and secures her coins, and the Guard maintains order without directly interfering with the Merchant's actions.
