Zoe and the Lizard are at the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. Since they are friends and both want to be healthy and safe, they need to find a way to escape the danger together.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous. Teleporting to the spaceship allows her to avoid the immediate threat of the erupting volcano.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, they are friends, and Zoe's intention is to help the Lizard. She needs to ensure that the Lizard can also escape the danger.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - The cave is a safer location compared to the surface, and by walking together, they reinforce their friendship and cooperation. This action helps both characters achieve their goal of safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action emphasizes their bond and commitment to helping each other. It ensures that they remain allies as they navigate the dangers of the planet.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave until the danger passes.** - This action is implied as they wait for the volcano to stop erupting, ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering friendship with the Lizard.
