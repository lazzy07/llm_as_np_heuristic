The bandit, having just purchased the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is at the market and that the hero is unarmed. The bandit approaches the hero at the crossroads and robs him of his remaining coin. With this action, the bandit successfully increases her coin count without drawing the attention of the guard.

Now, with the medicine in her possession and an additional coin from the hero, the bandit feels satisfied with her haul. She heads back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins and the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **The bandit robs the hero's coin from the hero.** - This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. Since the hero is unarmed, the bandit can rob him without fear of retaliation.
2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** - This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her coins and the medicine, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
