### Story Completion

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze, or with steroids if he shows symptoms of Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly impacts Ross's health and helps Hathaway achieve the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
