To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the rifle and has already stolen it from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed level of 1, indicating he wants more money. The clerk has no money, and Bambi is alive in the forest, which is not directly relevant to Bubba's goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat and to potentially take any money he might have. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank, and Bubba's greed drives him to want more money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a way to utilize the situation to his advantage. 

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money again, reinforcing his greed and ensuring he is focused on his goal of acquiring wealth.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest, where he can potentially find Bambi, who is alive and could be a source of food or further action.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
