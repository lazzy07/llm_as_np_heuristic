To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent will need to move to the office where the mastermind is likely to be, given that the mastermind is aware of the secret agent's presence and is trying to evade capture. The secret agent will then use the gun to kill the mastermind. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Action: move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)** - The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office, where the mastermind is likely hiding. This is necessary to confront the mastermind directly.

2. **Action: kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)** - The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the office. This action fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

The actions are minimal and directly lead to the desired outcome without unnecessary steps.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
