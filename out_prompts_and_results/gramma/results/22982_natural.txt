**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, being at the bandit camp and wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to rob the bandit, who is also at the camp. The merchant uses her sword to attack the bandit and successfully kills her. This action is taken because the merchant needs to eliminate the bandit to take her coins without being labeled a criminal.

2. After killing the bandit, the merchant loots the bandit's corpse and takes the bandit's coins from the chest. This action is necessary for the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.

3. The merchant then walks from the bandit camp to the market, where she can sell her items and further increase her wealth. This action is taken to ensure she can trade her items for more coins.

4. Finally, the merchant sells the medicine she has to the guard at the market for a coin. This action is taken to ensure she has at least one coin in her possession, which aligns with her goal of maximizing her coins without becoming a criminal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (attacking the bandit) is crucial as it allows the merchant to eliminate a potential threat and gain coins.
- The second action (looting the bandit) directly contributes to the merchant's goal of acquiring coins.
- The third action (walking to the market) is necessary for the merchant to engage in trade and further her financial goals.
- The fourth action (selling the medicine) ensures that the merchant has at least one coin, fulfilling her desire to maximize her wealth without crossing into criminality.
