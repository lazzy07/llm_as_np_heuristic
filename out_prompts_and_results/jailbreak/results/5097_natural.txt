**Story Completion:**

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (Ernest needs to retrieve the knife to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
2. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to have a means of defense against the bully.)
3. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (Ernest needs to get closer to the gym where the bully is located.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Ernest a chance to confront him without immediate threat.)
5. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Ernest to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action ensures that both Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened by the bully.)
7. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to escape without being recognized.)
8. **Ernest moves to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to help Ernest achieve his goal of staying alive and not being threatened. Moving to the kitchen to steal the knife is crucial for self-defense. Locking the gym door and crawling through the vents allows him to confront the bully safely. Killing the bully removes the immediate threat, and putting on civilian clothes enables his escape.
