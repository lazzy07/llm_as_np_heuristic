In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but they lack wealth. Gargax, the hungry dragon, is also in the cave, eyeing the humans. To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, the following actions take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to satisfy his hunger. By eating Rory, Gargax will also leave Talia alone, allowing her to focus on her own goals without the threat of the dragon.

2. **Talia takes the treasure**: After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can now safely pick up the treasure that is in the cave. This action will make Talia wealthy, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy, which also contributes to her happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action eliminates a potential threat to Talia and allows her to focus on her own desires without the distraction of Rory's needs or the dragon's hunger.
- **Talia takes the treasure**: This action directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, which is essential for her happiness.
