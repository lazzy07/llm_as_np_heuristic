To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and identify the correct disease he may have. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.

Since the story only requires Ross to be treated correctly to achieve his goal, no further actions are necessary for the other patients or for Hathaway's workload.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
