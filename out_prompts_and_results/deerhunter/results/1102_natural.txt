To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, while the clerk has no money. Bambi is in the forest and is not directly involved in the bank scenario. 

Here’s a concise sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** - Bubba needs to go to the forest to find Bambi, who is alive and could potentially be hunted.
3. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, and it also aligns with Bubba's goal of having money, as he can eat Bambi.
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba will eat the deer, satisfying his hunger.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Deciding to eat** is crucial for Bubba to address his hunger before he engages in any further actions.
- **Going to the forest** is necessary for Bubba to encounter Bambi, who is his target for food.
- **Shooting and killing Bambi** directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.
- **Deciding to eat again** allows Bubba to consume Bambi, which not only satisfies his hunger but also aligns with the story's goal of ensuring Bubba has something to gain from the encounter.

With these actions, we achieve the ending where Bambi is dead, and Bubba has satisfied his hunger.
