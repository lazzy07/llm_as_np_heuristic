Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that she needs to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. Since her workload is at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake if she tries to treat a patient without assessing them first. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to gather information about the patients, Jones, Ross, and Young, who are all currently in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.** This action is essential to ensure that Jones receives the necessary attention and treatment. By admitting Jones, Dr. Hathaway can then assess and treat him.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, this assessment is crucial for identifying whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze with antibiotics.** Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), this treatment will make him healthy. If he had Jarkis, the treatment would have been incorrect, but since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, this is the best course of action.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, ensuring he is healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
