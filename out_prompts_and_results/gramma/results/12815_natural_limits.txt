The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the crossroads. Knowing that the hero is unarmed, she decides to attack. 

1. The bandit attacks the hero and kills him. This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate a potential threat and to take the hero's coin, which she desires.
2. The bandit loots the hero's corpse and takes the hero's coin. This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

With the hero dead and the bandit now carrying the hero's coin, she successfully fulfills her objective of having coins in her possession.
