Zoe, the space explorer, is currently in a cave on the planet, while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. To achieve this, Zoe needs to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to reach out to the Lizard and make peace. This action is crucial because it allows them to stop any potential conflict and start building a friendship. Since they are not currently fighting, this action can be taken without any issues.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks from the cave to the surface where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to further solidify their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe makes peace again with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendly relationship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

At this point, Zoe has successfully achieved her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both characters remain healthy and safe.
