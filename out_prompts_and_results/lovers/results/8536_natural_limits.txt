In the living room, Alex holds the flowers and is happy. Casey, also in the living room, wants the jewelry, which is currently in the living room but with Alex. Blake is in the dining room and wants the chocolates, which are also in the dining room. 

To achieve their goal, Casey can take the following action:

1. **Casey gives flowers to Alex.** This action is necessary because it allows Casey to get Alex to give up the jewelry, which is the item Casey wants. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex now has the flowers, which they already had, and remains happy.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry after trading the flowers with Alex.
- Blake remains unhappy as they still do not have the chocolates.

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
