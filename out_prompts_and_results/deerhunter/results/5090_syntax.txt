To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, which means he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and desires money. The bank clerk has money, and Bubba can take action to acquire it.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can find the bank clerk and the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where the money is located.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
