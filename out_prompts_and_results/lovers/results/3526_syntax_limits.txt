In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R12) and has the jewelry (I3) that they picked up from Casey (C2). Casey is also in the dining room and has not yet achieved happiness. Blake (C3) is in the living room (R22) and has the flowers (I1).

To achieve Alex's goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I3) they have with Casey for the chocolates (I2) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to give away an item they do not want in exchange for an item that Casey wants, which will help Casey become happy. 

After this trade, Alex will still not be happy, but Casey will be happy with the chocolates. However, since the goal is for Alex to achieve happiness, we need to ensure that Alex can eventually get the flowers from Blake.

2. **Move**: Alex can then move to the living room (R22) to get the flowers from Blake. 

3. **Give**: Finally, Alex can give the chocolates (I2) to Blake in exchange for the flowers (I1). 

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers.
