To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, Casey (C3) is happy, and Blake (C2) is not happy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This is necessary for Alex to be able to pick up the jewelry.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry (I1) back in the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be used to facilitate a trade or give the item to another character if needed.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Blake and Casey. This action helps Alex to be in the same room as the other characters.

5. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3). This action is important because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn can lead to Alex's happiness.

6. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to check on the chocolates (I2). This action is not directly related to Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing.

7. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R21). This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want.

8. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R22). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the items in play.

9. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey trades the flowers (I3) they have for the chocolates (I2) with Blake. This action allows both characters to achieve their happiness.

10. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Blake. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the characters together.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have given the jewelry to Casey, who is also happy. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)",
    "put_down(C1, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "give(C1, I1, C3, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C2, I2, R21)",
    "put_down(C2, I2, R22)",
    "trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
```

Each action is designed to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want and facilitating the happiness of the other characters in the process.
