The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the crossroads. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her plans, she decides to attack him. The guard, unarmed against the banditâ€™s sword, is unable to defend himself and is killed. The bandit then loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword and any coins he might have. With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now safely return to her camp with the coins she has acquired.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the guard**: The bandit attacks the guard because he poses a threat to her safety and her goal of acquiring coins. Since the guard is not armed, the bandit can successfully kill him.
2. **Loot the guard's corpse**: After killing the guard, the bandit loots his body to take any coins he might have, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
