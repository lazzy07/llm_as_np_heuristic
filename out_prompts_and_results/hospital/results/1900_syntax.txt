To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in Exam Room C and has a symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine the correct treatment. Admitting Jones to Exam Room A will allow Hathaway to assess and treat him.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to identify his symptoms. Since Jones has SymptomA, Hathaway will recognize that he has the same symptom as Ross, which is also SymptomA.

3. **Treat Jones in Exam Room A with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones and confirming he has Flaze (since SymptomA corresponds to Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Young is currently in Admissions and has a different symptom (SymptomB). Admitting Young to Exam Room B will allow Hathaway to assess and treat him as well.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to identify his symptoms. Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young in Exam Room B with Steroids**: After assessing Young and confirming he has Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

By following these steps, both Jones and Young will be treated correctly, ensuring they are both alive and healthy.
