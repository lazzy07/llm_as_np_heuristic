To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, here’s a concise story that leads to that outcome:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry (I3)** in the living room (R12). This is a lie, as Alex actually wants the flowers (I1). However, this misinformation will prompt Casey to act.
   - **Action:** tell(Blake, Casey, I3, R12)

2. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I3)** from the dining room (C1) where it is located. This is necessary for Casey to have the item they want.
   - **Action:** pick_up(Casey, I3, R21)

3. **Casey gives the jewelry (I3)** to Blake in the living room (R12). This action is crucial as it allows Casey to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy, which is part of their own happiness.
   - **Action:** give(Casey, I3, Blake, R12)

4. **Blake gives the chocolates (I2)** to Casey in the living room (R12). This action ensures that Casey receives an item they want, thus achieving their happiness.
   - **Action:** give(Blake, I2, Casey, R12)

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Telling a lie** about what Alex wants creates a scenario where Casey feels compelled to act, believing they are helping Blake.
- **Picking up the jewelry** is essential for Casey to have the item they desire.
- **Giving the jewelry to Blake** allows Casey to feel they are contributing to Blake's happiness, which is important for their own happiness.
- **Receiving chocolates from Blake** ensures that Casey has an item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
