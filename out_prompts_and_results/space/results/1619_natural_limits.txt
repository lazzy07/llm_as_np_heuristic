Zoe, realizing that the surface is uninhabitable and that she needs to understand the Lizard better, decides to teleport to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is crucial because it allows her to confront the Lizard directly and potentially establish a relationship. 

Upon arriving at the cave, Zoe finds the Lizard and, instead of attacking or being hostile, she extends a hand of friendship. The Lizard, surprised but intrigued, accepts her gesture. This action is significant as it transforms their relationship from enemies to friends, aligning with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends and ensuring safety.

However, while they are in the cave, the volcano on the surface begins to erupt again. This eruption is a natural consequence of the story's setting and serves as a dramatic backdrop to their newfound friendship, emphasizing the dangers of the planet and the need for cooperation.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Zoe teleports to the cave to meet the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends.
2. Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which is essential for achieving their mutual goal of friendship.
3. The volcano erupts, adding tension to the story and highlighting the urgency of their situation.
