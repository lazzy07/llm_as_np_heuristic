Ernest, realizing that he is threatened by the bully and that he needs to escape, decides to take action. He crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he knows the bully is locked inside. Once in the gym, he uses the knife he stole earlier to confront the bully. In a moment of desperation, he kills the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now safely return to the hallway and put on the civilian clothes he knows are in the laundry room. This disguise will allow him to escape the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Crawl through the vents to the gym**: This action allows Ernest to confront the bully directly, as he knows the bully is locked inside and he needs to eliminate the threat.
2. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This is a crucial action that removes the immediate danger to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to live without fear of the bully's threats.
