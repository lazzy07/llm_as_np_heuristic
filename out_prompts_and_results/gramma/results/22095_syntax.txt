To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is armed with a sword. Since Tom is not a criminal, the bandit can take one of Tom's coins. This action helps the bandit gain a coin without needing to engage in a more dangerous confrontation.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This is where the bandit prefers to be and where she can store her coins safely.

3. **Take Bandit Coin from Chest**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin collection.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Robbing Tom**: This action allows the bandit to gain a coin without risking her life, as Tom is not a criminal and is not likely to retaliate.
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This is a strategic move to ensure the bandit is in her preferred location, where she can safely keep her coins.
- **Taking the Bandit Coin from the Chest**: This action fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)",
    "take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible while minimizing risk.
