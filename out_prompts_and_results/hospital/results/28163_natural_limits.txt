Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, assesses Ross, who is experiencing a rash. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition as Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting. Hathaway assigns Jones to Patient Room A. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is now 2, there is no risk of error. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, assuming he has Flaze, which is a reasonable assumption given the circumstances. Jones becomes healthy.

With both Ross and Jones treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
