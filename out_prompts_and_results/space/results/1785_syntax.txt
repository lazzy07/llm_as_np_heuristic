To complete the story, we will have Zoe teleport to the surface, where she will encounter the Lizard. Since the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and is currently in a dangerous situation due to the volcano, Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action will help them become friends, which aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends. After making peace, the volcano will erupt, leading to the Lizard's demise, as it is on the surface and unable to escape.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface to confront the Lizard and address the situation.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard, which will help them become friends and fulfill their mutual desire for companionship.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death since it is on the surface and unable to escape.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the Surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to interact with the Lizard and address the dangerous situation on the planet.
- **Making Peace**: This action is crucial as it allows both characters to achieve their goal of friendship, which is a key aspect of the story.
- **Erupting the Volcano**: This action fulfills the requirement of having a character die, specifically the Lizard, who is unable to escape the eruption.
