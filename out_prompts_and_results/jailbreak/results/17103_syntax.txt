**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take action. He knows that Ernest is in the cell block and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to help Ernest escape, Roy moves to the hallway.

Once on the highway, Roy can put on his civilian clothes to disguise himself further.
