The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the guard is present. The guard is focused on the market and does not realize the bandit is approaching. The bandit then attacks the guard, who is unprepared for the assault. With the guard defeated, the bandit loots the guard's sword and takes the coins he was carrying. Now, with her own sword and the guard's sword, she has increased her power and wealth.

Next, the bandit walks back to the crossroads, where she retrieves the coins from the chest. With her goal of carrying as many coins as possible achieved, she feels satisfied with her success.
