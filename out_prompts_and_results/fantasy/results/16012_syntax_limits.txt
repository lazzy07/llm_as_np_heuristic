In the cave, Gargax is hungry and desires wealth. Talia and Rory are also present in the cave, but they are not Gargax's primary concern. To achieve his goal of wealth and to satisfy his hunger, Gargax decides to take action.

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which eliminates one of the humans in the cave. This action not only satisfies Gargax's hunger but also allows him to take Rory's money, which he desires. Since Rory had money, Gargax can now achieve his goal of being wealthy.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax picks up the treasure that is located in the cave. This further increases his wealth, fulfilling his desire for riches.

With these two actions, Gargax has successfully satisfied both his hunger and his desire for wealth.
