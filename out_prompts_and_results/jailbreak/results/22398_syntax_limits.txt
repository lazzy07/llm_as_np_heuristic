**Story Completion:**

As the gym door locked behind him, Ernest felt a surge of adrenaline. He had the knife in his hand, and the bully was right in front of him, still unaware of the danger he was in. 

Ernest knew he had to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He lunged forward and used the knife to kill the bully. With the bully out of the way, Ernest could finally breathe a sigh of relief. He had eliminated the threat that loomed over him and Roy.

Now, with the bully dead, Ernest could focus on escaping the prison. He quickly moved to the hallway, where he could crawl through the vents to the highway. Once outside, he would put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier to disguise himself and make his escape.
