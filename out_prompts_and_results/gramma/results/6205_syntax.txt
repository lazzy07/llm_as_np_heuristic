To achieve the goal of the Bandit, who wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where she can interact with Tom and the Merchant. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to be in a location where she can potentially rob Tom or take advantage of the situation.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coin he has from the Merchant. This action is crucial for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads. This is necessary for her to move back to a location where she can either go to the Bandit Camp or stay hidden.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
