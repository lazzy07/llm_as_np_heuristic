To ensure the Guard achieves their goal of killing criminals, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **Tom walks to the Crossroads**: Tom is currently at the Market and needs to get to the Cottage carrying the medicine. However, he is unaware of the Bandit's presence and is not a criminal. He will walk to the Crossroads to eventually head to the Cottage.

2. **Guard reports the location of the Bandit**: The Guard, who is at the Market, believes that the Bandit is at the Cottage. He will report this to the Merchant, who is also at the Market. This action is necessary for the Guard to inform others about the Bandit's potential location.

3. **Guard walks to the Cottage**: After reporting, the Guard will walk to the Cottage, where he believes the Bandit is located. This is essential for the Guard to confront the Bandit.

4. **Guard attacks the Bandit**: Upon arriving at the Cottage, the Guard will attack the Bandit, who is a criminal. This action is crucial for the Guard to achieve his goal of killing a criminal.

5. **Guard loots the Bandit**: After successfully attacking the Bandit, the Guard will loot the Bandit for any items, which may include coins. This action is not necessary for the Guard's primary goal but is a logical follow-up to ensure he benefits from the encounter.
