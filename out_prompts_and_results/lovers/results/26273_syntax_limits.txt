To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy because they do not have the jewelry, and it is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Blake (C2) for the flowers (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to eventually get the jewelry they want. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will be able to get the jewelry from Blake (C2) in the next step.
- Casey (C3) will now have the flowers (I3), which they do not want, but they are still happy because they are helping Blake (C2) to be happy.

Now, Alex can take the jewelry from Blake in the next step, ensuring they are happy.

**Final Explanation of the Story:**
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Alex can eventually get the jewelry they want. Since Alex's happiness is contingent on having the jewelry, this trade sets up the next step for Alex to achieve their goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
