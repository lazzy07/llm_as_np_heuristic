To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex (C1) trades the flowers (I3) they have with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will still be unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this action fulfills that requirement.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
