In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, Zoe will take the action of teleporting back to the spaceship, which will anger the Lizard. This action will not lead to a fight, but it will leave the Lizard vulnerable on the surface as the volcano erupts.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship to ensure her safety, leaving the Lizard alone on the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to prioritize her health and safety, which is her main goal.

After Zoe teleports to the ship, the volcano erupts, and since the Lizard is still on the surface, it will die due to the eruption.

The final outcome is that the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe remains safe on the spaceship. The story does not include a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, as the Lizard's death prevents any possibility of making peace.
