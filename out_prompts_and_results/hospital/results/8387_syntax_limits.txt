**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in the admissions room with two patients, Ross and Young, who are both waiting to be assigned to exam rooms. Hathaway decides to admit Ross to Exam Room C and Young to Exam Room A.

1. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room C, which increases their workload to 3. This is necessary to ensure Ross is seen and treated promptly.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room A, which keeps their workload at 3. This is also necessary to ensure Young is seen and treated.

3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Ross. This action is necessary to evaluate Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

4. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway cannot determine the disease at this moment.

5. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway walks back to Exam Room A to assess Young. This is necessary to evaluate Young's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

6. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Young also has not shown any symptoms yet, so Hathaway cannot determine the disease.

7. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway mistakenly treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms, this action is a gamble, but it is necessary to ensure he receives treatment.

8. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Again, this is a gamble, but it is necessary to ensure he receives treatment.

In the end, both patients are treated, and Hathaway has done their best to ensure the health of the patients, achieving their goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The admissions actions are necessary to assign patients to exam rooms for assessment.
- The walking actions are necessary for Hathaway to move between exam rooms to assess patients.
- The assessment actions are necessary to determine the symptoms of the patients, even if they do not show any.
- The treatment actions are necessary to provide care to the patients, even if there is a risk of misdiagnosis due to the workload.
