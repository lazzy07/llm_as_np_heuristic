To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi is a potential target.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - Bubba has a loaded rifle and is hungry. Shooting Bambi will allow Bubba to eat, which is a priority since he is hungry. Additionally, this action will provide Bubba with a dead animal to eat.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and achieve his goal of obtaining money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can steal the clerk's money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger and successfully acquires the money he desires.
