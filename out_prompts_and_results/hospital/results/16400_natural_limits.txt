Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that she needs to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. Since her workload is at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake if she tries to treat a patient without assessing them first. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to gather information about Jones, Ross, and Young, who are all currently in the admissions room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.** By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can later assess and treat him. This action also reduces her workload by one.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** This is crucial for determining whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, allowing Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** Assuming Jones has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy. This action reduces Hathaway's workload by one and achieves her goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy.

After these actions, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully fulfilled her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to Admissions**: Necessary to assess the patients and understand their conditions.
- **Admitting Jones**: Allows Hathaway to manage her patients effectively and reduces her workload.
- **Assessing Jones**: Critical to identify the correct disease and avoid mistakes due to her high workload.
- **Treating Jones**: Directly addresses the goal of making the patient healthy.
