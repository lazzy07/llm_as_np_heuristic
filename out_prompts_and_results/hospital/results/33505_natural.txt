**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B and observes Fever. Since Young has a fever, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones and Ross. Since both are in the admissions room and their symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A and Jones to Patient Room C. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross's symptoms are still unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot treat him correctly. However, Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones's symptoms are also unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot treat him correctly either. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
