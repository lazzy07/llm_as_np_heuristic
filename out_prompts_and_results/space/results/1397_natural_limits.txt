Zoe, realizing that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to take action to help her friend, the Lizard. She knows that the Lizard is at risk and wants to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** This action is necessary because Zoe wants to be with the Lizard and help them. By teleporting to the surface, she can assess the situation and potentially assist the Lizard in escaping the danger of the volcano.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Since they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they can work together to find safety. It also emphasizes their mutual goal of being healthy and safe.

However, as Zoe arrives on the surface, the volcano erupts, and the Lizard, despite their friendship, is caught in the eruption and dies. This fulfills the requirement of the story ending with a character dying.

- **Teleporting to the surface:** This action is crucial for Zoe to be present with the Lizard, as she wants to help and ensure their safety.
- **Making peace:** This action solidifies their friendship and allows them to work together, even though it ultimately leads to a tragic outcome.
