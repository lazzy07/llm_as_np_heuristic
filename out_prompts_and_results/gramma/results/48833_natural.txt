The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is at the market and that the merchant is dead, leaving her free to act without immediate threat. 

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at her camp, as she prefers to be there and it is the safest location for her.

2. Once at the bandit camp, the bandit places the hero's coin into the chest. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

With these two actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
