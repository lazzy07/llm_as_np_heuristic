**Story Completion:**

After stealing the pack of cigarettes, Roy finds himself in a precarious situation. He knows that the bully is in the cell block and is likely to threaten him if he finds out about the cigarettes. To ensure his safety and to help his friend Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Disguise (Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room while he is on the highway. This action is crucial because it allows him to disguise himself and avoid being recognized by the guards or the bully, which is essential for his escape.

2. **Escape (Roy, Highway)**: With the disguise on, Roy makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free, as he no longer has to worry about the threats from the bully or the prison environment.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action, disguising himself, is necessary for Roy to avoid detection and ensure his safety while escaping. Without the disguise, he would be at risk of being caught by the guards or the bully.
- The second action, escaping, is the ultimate goal for Roy. By successfully escaping, he achieves his desire to be alive and free from the threats of prison life.
