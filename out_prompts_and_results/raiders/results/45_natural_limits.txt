In the current situation, the U.S. Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead. Indiana Jones is alive and aware of the situation. Since the goal is to ensure that the U.S. Army retains possession of the Ark and that the Nazis remain dead, the simplest action to take is for Indiana Jones to confirm the safety of the Ark.

**Action: Indiana Jones opens the Ark.**

**Explanation:**
- Indiana Jones believes the Ark is dangerous, but he also knows that the U.S. Army has it. By opening the Ark, he can confirm its status. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will lead to Indiana Jones's death, but it does not affect the U.S. Army's possession of the Ark or the fact that the Nazis are already dead. This action serves to conclude Indiana's arc while ensuring the U.S. Army retains the Ark.

**Final Story:**
Indiana Jones, realizing the potential threat of the Ark, decides to open it to confirm its danger. As he opens the Ark, he is engulfed by its power and dies, ensuring that the Ark remains with the U.S. Army, who are now aware of its true nature.
