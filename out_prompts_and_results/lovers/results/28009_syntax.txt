To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake is not happy, and they want item I2, which is currently unknown to us. However, we know that Casey wants item I3, which is in Blake's possession. 

To achieve the goal, we can have Blake trade item I1 (jewelry) with Casey for item I2 (chocolates). This will make Blake happy, as they will have the item they want.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake (C3) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C2) for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is I2.

After this action, Blake will be happy because they have the item they wanted (I2).

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness. Since Blake wants I2 and Casey has it, trading I1 for I2 directly fulfills Blake's desire.

### Final Plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)"]
