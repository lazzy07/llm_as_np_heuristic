To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is present in the cave, making him a viable target for Gargax to eat. This action will fulfill Gargax's hunger.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: After eating Rory, Gargax will travel to the village where Vince is located. Gargax will then take the money from Vince, as Vince is now vulnerable after losing Rory. This action will increase Gargax's wealth.

3. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels from the cave to the village to confront Vince and take the money.

By performing these actions, Gargax will achieve their goal of being wealthy (by taking the money) and not hungry (by eating Rory).

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Rory, who is in the cave. This action satisfies Gargax's hunger.
2. After eating, Gargax travels to the village where Vince is located.
3. Gargax takes the money from Vince, increasing their wealth.
