To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This is essential for ensuring that Jones receives the appropriate care.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Similarly, Hathaway must assess Young to understand their condition and provide the right treatment.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing both patients, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to check on Ross, who is still waiting there.

4. **Admit Ross to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will admit Ross to an exam room so that he can be assessed and treated.

5. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to identify his symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones with antibiotics in PatientRoomA**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for that disease.

7. **Treat Young with steroids in PatientRoomC**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for that disease.

8. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication based on his diagnosis.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and well-being.
