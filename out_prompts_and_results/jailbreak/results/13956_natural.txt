**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing he needs to help Roy and protect himself from the bully, decides to take action. He knows the knife is in the kitchen, so he sneaks back through the vent to the kitchen to retrieve it. Once he has the knife, he returns to the hallway and locks the gym door again to ensure the bully cannot escape. 

Meanwhile, Roy is in the gym, unaware of Ernest's actions. The bully, thinking he can intimidate Roy, is caught off guard when Ernest bursts into the gym with the knife. With the bully distracted, Ernest confronts him and, in a moment of desperation, stabs the bully, killing him. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest quickly tells Roy what happened and they both put on the civilian clothes that Ernest had stolen earlier. They then make their way to the highway, where they can escape the prison together.
