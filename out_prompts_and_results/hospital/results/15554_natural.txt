**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit the remaining patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** (This action is also necessary for the same reason as above.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A.** (Assuming Young has Flaze, this treatment with antibiotics will make Young healthy.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.)
8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Jones has Jarkis, this treatment with steroids will make Jones healthy.)
