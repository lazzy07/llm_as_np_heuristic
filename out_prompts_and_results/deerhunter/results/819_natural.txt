Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. He has already stolen the rifle from the clerk at gunpoint. To achieve his goal of having money, he needs to take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk as a threat and take the money he believes the clerk has. Since the clerk has 0 money, this action will not yield money directly, but it will ensure Bubba's safety and allow him to leave without interference.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** This action is the execution of the previous decision. It ensures that Bubba can take control of the situation without the clerk being able to stop him.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that he believes the clerk has. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene and find a safe place to eat, as he is still hungry.

5. **Bubba decides to eat.** Finally, after reaching the house, Bubba can satisfy his hunger.

The story is concise and follows the necessary actions to achieve Bubba's goal of having money and addressing his hunger.
