**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action. He quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he can access the vents. He crawls through the vents to reach the kitchen, where he knows the knife is located. Once he retrieves the knife, he heads back to the hallway and locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. With the bully now locked in, Ernest confronts him and uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that both he and Roy are no longer threatened.

3. **Lock the gym door**: By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape and is trapped, allowing him to confront the bully safely.
4. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This final action eliminates the threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing them to be safe and achieve their goal of staying alive.
