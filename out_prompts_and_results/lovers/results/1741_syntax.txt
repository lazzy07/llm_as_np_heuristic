To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to help him.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making him happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will still be unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this is acceptable.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to be with Alex and Blake, allowing for interaction.
2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex, fulfilling his desire and making him happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
