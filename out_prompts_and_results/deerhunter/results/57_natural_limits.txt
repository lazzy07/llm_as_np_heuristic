Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to satisfy his hunger, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has a loaded rifle, he aims and shoots Bambi. This action fulfills his need for food. After shooting Bambi, he decides to eat the deer, satisfying his hunger.

Here’s the breakdown of the actions:

1. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: This action is necessary because Bubba wants to eat, and Bambi is a source of food. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi.
   
2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: After shooting Bambi, this action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is his immediate goal.

These two actions are sufficient for Bubba to achieve his goal of eating, and they are the only necessary actions to complete the story.
