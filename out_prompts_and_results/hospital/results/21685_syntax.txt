To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will first need to admit Jones to an exam room. However, since Jones is already assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will need to admit Ross to an exam room. Since Ross is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Similarly, Hathaway will need to admit Young to an exam room. After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment.

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway assesses each patient to determine their symptoms and then treats them accordingly, leading to all patients becoming healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
