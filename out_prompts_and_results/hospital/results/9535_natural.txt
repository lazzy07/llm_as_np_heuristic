Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess too many patients. Therefore, the best course of action is to first assess one patient at a time, starting with Young, who is in Patient Room A.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway will not know the actual disease yet, but this is necessary to reduce the workload and gather information.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing Young has Flaze due to the Unknown symptoms. This is a risk, but since Young is alive, they will survive the treatment.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess the next patient, Jones.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Again, Hathaway will not know the actual disease.

5. **Treat Jones**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing Jones has Jarkis. Since Jones is alive, they will survive the treatment.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess the last patient, Ross.

7. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing Unknown symptoms.

8. **Treat Ross**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing Ross has Flaze. Since Ross is alive, they will survive the treatment.

By following this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.
