She knows that the Lizard is at risk on the surface and that they need to establish a relationship to achieve their mutual goals of health and safety.

2. **Zoe finds the Lizard on the surface and initiates a conversation.** - Since they are not fighting, Zoe can attempt to make peace. She expresses her concern for the Lizard's safety and suggests they work together to escape the danger of the erupting volcano.

3. **The Lizard, realizing Zoe's intentions are friendly, agrees to make peace.** - This action is crucial as it establishes a friendship between them, aligning with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe.

4. **Suddenly, the volcano erupts.** - This event is a natural consequence of the story's setting and adds urgency to their situation.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - They both realize that the only way to ensure their safety is to leave the surface immediately. They work together to teleport, which solidifies their newfound friendship.

6. **The volcano finishes erupting, but Zoe and the Lizard are safe on the spaceship.** - This ending shows that despite the danger, their friendship has led to their survival.
