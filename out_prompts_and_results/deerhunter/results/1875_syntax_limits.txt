To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money. After this action, Bubba can take the money from the clerk.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome with only two actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to eliminate the bank clerk, who possesses the money that Bubba desires. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can now pick up the money, fulfilling his greed and achieving his goal.
