To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already stolen the rifle and has loaded ammunition, which gives him the power to take further actions. 

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential threat to his goal of obtaining money. By shooting the clerk, he can ensure that he can take the money without any opposition.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** This action is necessary to fulfill the first action's intent. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money without any risk of being stopped.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money, and Bambi remains alive, but the story's requirement is satisfied since Bubba has the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to shoot the clerk:** Bubba recognizes that the clerk is a barrier to his goal of obtaining money.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action directly leads to the clerk's demise, allowing Bubba to take the money.
- **Pick up the money from the clerk:** This final action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide to shoot the clerk",
    "shoot the clerk",
    "pick up the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
