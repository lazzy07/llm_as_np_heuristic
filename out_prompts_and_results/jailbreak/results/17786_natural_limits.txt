**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take a risk. He sneaks into the gym through the hallway, where the bully is currently engaged in his workout. With the knife hidden in his pocket, Ernest approaches the bully, who is unaware of his presence. In a swift motion, Ernest pulls out the knife and confronts the bully, demanding that he leave both him and Roy alone. The bully, taken by surprise, tries to fight back, but Ernest is determined. In a moment of desperation, Ernest stabs the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten them.

With the bully incapacitated, Ernest quickly leaves the gym and heads back to the hallway. He puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, which he had hidden in the laundry room. Now disguised, he makes his way to the highway. Once outside, he successfully escapes from the prison, finally free from the threats that loomed over him.
