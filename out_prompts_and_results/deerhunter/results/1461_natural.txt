To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba picks up Bambi**: Since Bambi is not alive, Bubba can pick her up. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to have something to eat, which will help satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba decides to eat**: After picking up Bambi, Bubba will decide to eat her. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a prerequisite for him to feel fulfilled and potentially motivated to pursue his goal of money.
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and achieve his goal of obtaining money.
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **Pick up Bambi**: Necessary to have something to eat.
- **Decide to eat**: Necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger.
- **Go to the bank**: Necessary to reach the location where the money is.
- **Steal the money**: Necessary to achieve the goal of having 1 money.
