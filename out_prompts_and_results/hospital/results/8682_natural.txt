**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose them, but they proceed to treat Young with antibiotics, believing they might have Flaze. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B. After admitting Jones, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing they have Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing Unknown, and treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing they have Flaze. This treatment is also incorrect, and Ross dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for the patients, Dr. Hathaway's actions were aimed at treating the patients to ensure their health, fulfilling their goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy.
