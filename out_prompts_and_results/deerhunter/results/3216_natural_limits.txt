To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to go back to the bank. He enters the bank and approaches the clerk. Since the clerk believes that Bubba has the rifle and is alive, he is intimidated. Bubba then demands the clerk to give him the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money to Bubba. Now, Bubba has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
2. **Bubba demands the money from the clerk.** - This action is implied as a necessary step to achieve Bubba's goal of having money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement.
