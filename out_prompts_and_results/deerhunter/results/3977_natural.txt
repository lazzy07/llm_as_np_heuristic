To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants the money, and the clerk is the only one who has it. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can eliminate the threat and take the money.
   
2. **Bubba shoots and kills the clerk.** - This action directly results in the clerk being dead, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After the clerk is dead, Bubba can now take the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
