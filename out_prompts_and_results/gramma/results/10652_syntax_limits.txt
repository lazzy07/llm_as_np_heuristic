In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has a sword, which allows her to rob other characters. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is at the Cottage and is not armed. This action allows the Bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying.

This action is necessary because it directly helps the Bandit achieve her goal of acquiring coins. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully rob him without any risk of retaliation.

After this action, the Bandit will have the coins she desires, fulfilling her goal.
