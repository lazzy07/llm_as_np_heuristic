To achieve the secret agent's goal of killing the mastermind, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby.**  
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to be in the same location as the mastermind to carry out the kill.

2. **The secret agent moves from the lobby to the courtyard.**  
   - This action is not necessary for the goal but is included to illustrate the movement. The secret agent can only move to the lobby with the papers, but since the goal is to kill the mastermind, this action will be omitted in the final plan.

3. **The secret agent moves from the courtyard to the lobby.**  
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent must be in the lobby to confront the mastermind.

4. **The secret agent kills the mastermind.**  
   - This action is the final step to achieve the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby.
2. The secret agent kills the mastermind.
