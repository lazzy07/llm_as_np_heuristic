**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A and observes a rash. Since the symptom matches the disease Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross and discovers he has a rash as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that Young has a rash. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, and Young becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
