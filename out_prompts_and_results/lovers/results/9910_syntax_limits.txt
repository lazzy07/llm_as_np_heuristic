In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in R12). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **give(Blake, I3, Alex, R12)**: Blake gives the item I3 to Alex in the dining room (R12). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, this action also makes Blake happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have I3.
- Blake is happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
- Casey remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Blake to be happy, this is acceptable.

The final plan in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(Blake, I3, Alex, R12)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, achieving Blake's goal with the minimum necessary action.
