To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, we need to be cautious about making mistakes. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.
2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Assuming Ross has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This will make Ross healthy if he indeed has Flaze.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess the other patients.
4. **Walk to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomB to assess Jones.
5. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones with steroids**: Assuming Jones has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This will make Jones healthy if he indeed has Jarkis.
7. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Young.
8. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms.
9. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Assuming Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This will make Young healthy if he indeed has Flaze.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is crucial to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating patients**: The treatment must match the disease to ensure the patients become healthy.
- **Walking between rooms**: This is necessary for Hathaway to reach each patient and assess them.
