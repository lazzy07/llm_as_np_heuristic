To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, we need to ensure that she can sell the medicine to Tom while avoiding any criminal activity. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Action: walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**  
   - The Merchant moves to the Market to be in a position to sell the medicine to Tom.

2. **Action: walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**  
   - Tom walks to the Crossroads to find the Merchant and buy the medicine.

3. **Action: buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**  
   - Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant using one of his coins. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without engaging in any criminal activity.

4. **Action: walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**  
   - The Merchant returns to the Market after the transaction, ensuring she is in a safe location.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully sold the medicine and gained a coin, achieving her goal without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's first action of walking to the Market is necessary to be in a position to sell the medicine.
- Tom's action of walking to the Crossroads is essential for him to reach the Merchant and complete the purchase.
- The buy action is crucial as it directly fulfills the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins legally.
- The Merchant's final walk back to the Market ensures she remains in a safe location after the transaction.
