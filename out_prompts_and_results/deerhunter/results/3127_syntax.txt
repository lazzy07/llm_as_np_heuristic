To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and wants money, while the clerk has money. The actions taken will focus on Bubba stealing the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is already completed, so Bubba has a loaded rifle, which is necessary for the next action.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
3. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes back to the house, ensuring he is away from the scene of the crime.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Loading the rifle**: This was already done, and it is essential for Bubba to be able to threaten the clerk.
- **Stealing from the clerk**: This is the primary action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
- **Going back to the house**: This action signifies that Bubba has successfully completed his goal and is now in a safe location.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, House)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully steals the money from the clerk and achieves his goal of becoming wealthy.
