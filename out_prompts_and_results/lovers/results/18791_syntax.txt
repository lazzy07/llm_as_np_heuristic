To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R22). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where Alex and Casey are located (R22). This is necessary for Blake to be present and witness Alex's happiness.

4. **tell(C3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that they have the flowers. This action reinforces the happiness of Alex by confirming that they have received what they wanted.
