To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants the money that the clerk has.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate him and take the money.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money that the clerk had.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is crucial as it sets Bubba's intention to take the money from the clerk.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action is necessary to remove the obstacle (the clerk) who possesses the money.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having the money.
