To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey can help Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but is included to allow Blake to eventually find the chocolates, which he wants. It also keeps the story flowing logically.

3. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the item he desires, which contributes to his happiness.

4. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to follow Blake and potentially trade or interact with him later, but it is not essential for Alex's immediate goal.

5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Blake is happy as well, as he wants the chocolates and now has the jewelry from Casey.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, fulfilling the goal.
