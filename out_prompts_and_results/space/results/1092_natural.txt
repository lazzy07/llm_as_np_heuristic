Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the danger surrounding them due to the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety and health while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensure her safety. Since she is currently not in danger of fighting with the Lizard, she can teleport without causing anger or conflict.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship back to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and to continue building their friendship. This action is important because it shows her commitment to the Lizard and their relationship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They both walk to the cave to find shelter from the erupting volcano. This action is crucial for both characters to ensure their safety and health, as the cave provides protection from the volcanic activity.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace solidifies their bond and ensures that they remain allies in the face of danger.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
