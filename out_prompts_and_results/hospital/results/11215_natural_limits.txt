Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room, as they need to be assessed for their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Young to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess Young's condition. This action also keeps the workload manageable, as it does not exceed three patients.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is crucial for determining Young's symptoms, which will inform the treatment needed.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this treatment will ensure Young becomes healthy. This action fulfills Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

After these actions, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully achieved their goal.
