To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to pick up the jewelry (I2) that they believe is there.
2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room.
3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Blake and Alex are.
4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2), making Blake happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to access the jewelry, which is believed to be in the dining room.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the jewelry, which is essential for Blake's happiness.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to return to the living room to give the jewelry to Blake.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: This final action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, thus achieving Blake's goal of happiness.

After these actions, the final state will be:
- Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2).
- Casey is happy because they have given away the item they wanted to help Blake.
- Alex remains unhappy, but their goal of wanting Blake to be happy is achieved.
