**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, who is in the kitchen with the knife, decides to take action to protect both himself and Ernest from the bully. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that the gym door is locked, Roy moves to the hallway to access the vents. 

1. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to bypass the locked door and confront the bully directly.)
   
Once in the gym, Roy finds the bully, who is unaware of his presence.

2. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing them to be safe from the bully's violence.)

With the bully dead, Roy now has the opportunity to escape.

3. **Roy takes the civilian clothes from the bully's belongings.** (This action allows Roy to disguise himself for a potential escape.)

4. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action disguises Roy, making it safe for him to leave the prison.)

5. **Roy crawls back through the vents to the hallway.** (This action allows Roy to return to the hallway without being detected.)

6. **Roy goes to the highway.** (This action takes Roy to the final location needed for escape.)

7. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This action fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Crawling through the vents allows Roy to avoid confrontation with the bully while still reaching him.
- Killing the bully removes the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest.
- Taking and putting on the civilian clothes is essential for disguising himself to escape.
- Crawling back through the vents and moving to the highway ensures that Roy can leave the prison without being caught.
