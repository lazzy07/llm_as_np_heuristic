To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to help Alex by giving them an item, even though it is not what Alex wants. However, it sets up the next action.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room where Casey is. This is necessary for Alex to be able to interact with Casey and potentially get the jewelry.

4. **tell(C2, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Alex about what they want, which is crucial for the next action.

5. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the jewelry.

6. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from Casey. This is the final action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
