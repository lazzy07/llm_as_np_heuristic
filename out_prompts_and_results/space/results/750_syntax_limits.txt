To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Given the current situation, the following actions will achieve this:

1. **Erupt the volcano on the surface**: This action will cause the volcano to erupt, which is a necessary step to fulfill the condition of the story where a character dies.
2. **Make peace between Zoe and the Lizard**: This action will allow Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, despite the impending eruption.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, which will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is currently on the spaceship and cannot escape in time.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling the requirement of making friends.

The story ends with Zoe dying due to the eruption while also establishing a friendship with the Lizard, which aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe and making friends.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of a character dying, as it leads to the destruction of the surface and the death of Zoe.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action is included to ensure that despite the tragic outcome, Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goal of friendship.
