Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway is determined to help Jones. After assessing, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to an exam room. Since Ross is still in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway admits him to Exam Room B. 

This sequence of actions ensures that both Jones is treated successfully and that Ross is prepared for assessment and treatment, ultimately leading to Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
