To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax will take the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary because Gargax needs to acquire wealth, and Vince is already dead, making it possible for Gargax to take the money without any consequences.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax will eat Rory. This action is necessary because Gargax is still hungry after eating Vince, and by eating Rory, Gargax will satisfy their hunger while also eliminating another potential threat.

3. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax will pick up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary to further increase Gargax's wealth, as the treasure is an additional valuable item.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring both the money and the treasure) and not hungry (by eating both Vince and Rory).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to gain wealth by taking the money from Vince, who is dead.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action satisfies Gargax's hunger by consuming Rory, ensuring that Gargax is no longer hungry.
- **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to collect the treasure, further increasing their wealth.
