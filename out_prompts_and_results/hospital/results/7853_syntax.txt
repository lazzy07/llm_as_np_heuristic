To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully assesses and treats both patients, Jones and Ross, to achieve the goal of having all hospital patients healthy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is assigned to exam room B. This action is necessary to get closer to the patient who needs assessment.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for identifying whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

4. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet.

5. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Ross to exam room C. This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room for assessment.

6. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks to exam room C to assess Ross.

7. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for identifying whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

8. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Assuming Ross has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of having all hospital patients healthy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Hathaway can assess and treat both patients effectively, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of health for all patients.
