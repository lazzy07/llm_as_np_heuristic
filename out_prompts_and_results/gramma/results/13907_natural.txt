The bandit, having successfully looted the medicine from the hero, now seeks to maximize her coins. She decides to return to the bandit camp to secure her coins in the chest. 

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her camp where she can store her coins safely.

2. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest.**  
   - This action is not explicitly stated in the prompt but is implied as a logical step for the bandit to secure her loot. However, since the prompt does not allow for new actions, we will skip this step.

3. **The bandit takes the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

4. **The bandit walks back to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to be in a location where she can interact with other characters or potentially rob them again if needed.

5. **The bandit reports her location to the guard.**  
   - This action is unnecessary for the bandit to achieve her goal but could be a strategic move to distract the guard from her criminal activities.

The final story is as follows:

- The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.
- The bandit takes the coins from the chest.
- The bandit walks back to the market.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
