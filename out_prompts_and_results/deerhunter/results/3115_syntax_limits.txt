Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both his desires. He goes to the bank where he knows the clerk has money. 

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money he desires.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded and his greed driving him, Bubba shoots the clerk, killing him and ensuring he can take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to satisfy his greed by obtaining money while also addressing his hunger indirectly, as he can now afford food.
