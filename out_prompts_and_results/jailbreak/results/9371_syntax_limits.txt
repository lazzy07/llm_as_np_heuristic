**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes. Roy wants to ensure that both he and Ernest are safe and can enjoy their cigarettes without the threat of the bully. 

Roy locks the gym door while the bully is inside, preventing him from coming out. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten them anymore. 

With the bully locked in, Roy then puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. This disguise will allow him to escape from the prison without being recognized.

Finally, Roy crawls through the vents to the highway, where he can escape from the prison.
