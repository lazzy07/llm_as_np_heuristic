Tom, realizing the danger posed by the bandit, decides to take action. He quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is at the market. The guard, upon receiving the information, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

Once the guard arrives at the crossroads, he sees the bandit and, armed with his sword, attacks and kills her. With the bandit defeated, Tom is now safe to retrieve the medicine from the merchant's corpse.
