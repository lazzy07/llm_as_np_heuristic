To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also alive in the forest, and Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to take the money. This action directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, fulfilling his goal of having money.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is to return to the forest after acquiring the money.

At this point, Bubba has the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a direct action to eliminate the obstacle (the clerk) who possesses the money.
- **Picking up the money** is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
- **Returning to the forest** is a logical conclusion to the story, as Bubba now has what he wanted.
