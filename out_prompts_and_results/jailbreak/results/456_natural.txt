**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to get rid of the cigarettes to avoid further confrontation. He quickly moves from the cell block to the laundry room where Roy is finishing his chores.

1. **Ernest moves to the laundry room.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to communicate with Roy and strategize together.)
   
Once in the laundry room, Ernest tells Roy about the bully's threat and shows him the pack of cigarettes. They both agree that they need to get rid of the cigarettes to avoid the bully's wrath.

2. **Ernest gives the cigarettes to Roy.** (This action helps to ensure that the cigarettes are no longer in Ernest's possession, reducing the threat from the bully.)

Roy, understanding the urgency, decides to hide the cigarettes in the laundry room, away from the bully's sight. 

3. **Roy hides the cigarettes in the laundry room.** (This action is crucial to protect both of them from the bully's anger.)

With the cigarettes hidden, they now need to ensure their safety. Roy remembers that the knife is in the kitchen and suggests they should get it for protection.

4. **Roy moves to the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to retrieve the knife, which will provide them with a means of defense against the bully.)

Once in the kitchen, Roy quickly grabs the knife and heads back to the laundry room.

5. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is essential for Roy to have a means of defense against the bully.)

Back in the laundry room, they discuss their next move. They realize that they need to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them.

6. **Roy locks the gym door from the hallway.** (This action is necessary to ensure that the bully cannot access them and poses no immediate threat.)

Feeling safer, they decide to wait until the end of the day to see if the situation calms down. As night falls, they hear the guards calling for everyone to return to their cells.

7. **Ernest and Roy return to their cells.** (This action is necessary to avoid drawing attention to themselves and to comply with the guards' orders.)

As day one ends, they feel a sense of relief knowing they have avoided confrontation with the bully and have the knife for protection.

**Day Two:**

On day two, they wake up and realize they need to escape. They decide to put on the civilian clothes hidden in the laundry room.

8. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action is necessary for disguise, allowing them to blend in and escape.)

With the civilian clothes on, they move to the hallway.

Finally, they crawl through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison.

10. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action is essential for their escape from the prison.)

Once on the highway, they feel the freedom they have longed for.
