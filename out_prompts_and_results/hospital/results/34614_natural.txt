**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Jones does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Jones dies. 

3. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Ross has Jarkis instead of Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young.

7. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, where she can be assessed.

8. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Young has Jarkis instead of Flaze.

9. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Young does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although flawed due to her high workload, lead to the unfortunate demise of all patients. However, she has completed her goal of assessing and treating all patients, albeit with tragic outcomes.
