Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable, so she decides to treat Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This action is risky, but Hathaway hopes to help Jones.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to and to reduce her workload by one.

After admitting Ross, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway again cannot identify the disease. However, she treats Ross with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room A. This ensures that all patients are being seen and treated.

In this sequence, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Jones and Ross, ensuring they are healthy, which aligns with her goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
