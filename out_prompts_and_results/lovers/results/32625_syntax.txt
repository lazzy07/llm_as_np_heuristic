To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (where they currently are) to the bathroom (where Casey is). This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to get the item they want.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the jewelry. This is a straightforward communication to express their desire.

3. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Casey moves to the living room to pick up the jewelry. This is necessary because the jewelry is currently with Blake in the living room.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R11)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from Blake. This is necessary for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C2, R11, R12)**: Casey moves back to the bathroom to give the jewelry to Alex.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
