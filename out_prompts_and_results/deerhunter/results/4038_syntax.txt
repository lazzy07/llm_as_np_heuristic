To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank with the rifle loaded and has a desire for money. The bank clerk is also present in the bank, and Bubba is greedy, which means he wants to take the clerk's money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the clerk's money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his position and avoid any potential consequences from the clerk.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger after the events that transpired.

The story ends with Bubba having the money from the clerk and having satisfied his hunger, achieving the goal of the story.
