To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory is in the Cave where the Treasure is located. By picking up the Treasure, Rory increases their wealth, which is essential for achieving their goal.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the Treasure, Rory will travel back to the Village. This is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince to interact with him.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory will marry Talia, who has already accepted his proposal. This action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory increases wealth by acquiring the Treasure.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory moves to the Village to interact with Vince.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes Money from Vince, increasing wealth.
