Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, both feeling the tension of the impending volcanic eruption outside. Zoe, wanting to make friends with the Lizard, decides to take a step towards peace. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goal of safety and health. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are not fighting, which is necessary for a positive relationship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they both leave the cave to find a safer place away from the volcano. This action is important as it keeps both characters safe from the eruption and allows them to explore the planet together, further solidifying their newfound friendship.

By making peace first, Zoe ensures that the Lizard is no longer an enemy, and by walking to the surface together, they can continue to build their friendship while avoiding danger.
