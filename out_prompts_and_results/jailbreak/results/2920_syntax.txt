   - Roy goes to the laundry room to put on the civilian clothes. This action is necessary for him to disguise himself and prepare for an escape.

2. **Action: go(Roy, Hall)**  
   - After disguising himself, Roy moves to the hallway. This is a required step to reach the highway where he can escape.

3. **Action: vent(Roy, Highway)**  
   - Roy crawls through the vents to get to the highway. This action allows him to bypass the prison guards and reach the outside.

4. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)**  
   - Finally, Roy escapes from the prison. This is the ultimate goal he wanted to achieve, ensuring his survival and freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising is crucial because without the civilian clothes, Roy would be easily recognized by the guards and would not be able to escape.
- Moving to the hallway is necessary as it connects the laundry room to the highway, which is the only exit point.
- Crawling through the vents is a stealthy way to avoid detection, allowing Roy to reach the highway without being caught.
- Escaping is the final action that fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.
