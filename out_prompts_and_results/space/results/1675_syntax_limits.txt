Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, and they both share a mutual desire for safety and friendship. To ensure that both of them can escape the imminent danger, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, leaving the surface behind.

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to her spaceship to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary for her to avoid the danger on the surface, but it also allows the Lizard to remain on the surface, where it feels safe and can continue to protect its territory.

By taking this action, Zoe prioritizes her safety while also respecting the Lizard's role as the guardian of the planet. The Lizard, now alone on the surface, can continue to fulfill its goal of being healthy and safe, as it is not in immediate danger from the volcano.
