Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve their goals of making friends, they need to establish a connection without fighting.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard agree to work together to ensure safety on the surface.** This action solidifies their relationship and aligns with both characters' desires for health and safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard leave the cave together to explore the surface.** This action demonstrates their newfound friendship and commitment to each other's safety.
