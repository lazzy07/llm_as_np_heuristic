To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R12) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially obtain the flowers.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Casey of their desire, which may prompt Casey to act in a way that helps Alex.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary for Casey to pick up the flowers and potentially give them to Alex.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R22). This action is essential for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R12) with the flowers. This allows Casey to return to Alex and facilitate the next action.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the living room (R12). This is the final action that ensures Alex receives the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have obtained the flowers they wanted.
