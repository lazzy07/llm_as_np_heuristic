To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in the room). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the item I3 (which they have) with Casey (C3) for the item I1 (which Casey has). This action is necessary because Casey wants I1, and by trading, Blake can help both Casey and Alex. After this trade, Alex will have I3.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey (C3) will give the item I3 to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Trade**: This action allows Blake to facilitate a swap that benefits both Casey and Alex. It is a strategic move to ensure that Alex can eventually get what they want.
- **Give**: This action is the final step that directly results in Alex obtaining I3, thus making Alex happy.
