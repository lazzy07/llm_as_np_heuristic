To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** 
   - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the Surface where the volcano is located to trigger its eruption and to confront the Lizard, who is currently there.

2. **Zoe begins to make peace with the Lizard.**
   - Since Zoe is now on the Surface with the Lizard, she can attempt to make peace. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship with the Lizard, which is one of her goals.

3. **The volcano erupts.**
   - This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying. Since Zoe is on the Surface, she will be affected by the eruption.

4. **Zoe dies due to the eruption.**
   - This is the outcome of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.**
   - Despite Zoe's death, the act of making peace before the eruption signifies that they have established a friendship, which is a key goal for both characters.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)
2. make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)
3. erupt(Surface)
