To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to solidify his possession of the money. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger. It also reinforces that Bambi is dead, which is already established.
   
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and confirms Bambi's death, ensuring that the story's conditions are met.

At this point, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and confirmed Bambi's death, which meets the requirement of the story ending with either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both). 

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **Deciding to eat Bambi**: This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat to survive.
- **Eating Bambi**: This action confirms Bambi's death and satisfies Bubba's hunger, ensuring he is alive and well.

Final JSON object with the plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat Bambi",
    "Bubba eats Bambi"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively concludes the story while adhering to the established conditions and actions.
