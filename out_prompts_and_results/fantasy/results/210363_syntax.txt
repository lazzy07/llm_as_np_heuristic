To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which can lead to her happiness. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Talia achieve her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and Vince more easily.
2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory follows Talia to the village, as he wants to be with her.
3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince also follows Talia to the village, wanting to be with her as well.
4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory, which makes both of them happy.
5. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia also marries Vince, which makes both of them happy again.

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goal of being happy (through marriage to both Rory and Vince) and wealthy (by possessing the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel actions**: These are necessary for Talia, Rory, and Vince to be in the same location (the village) to facilitate the marriage actions.
- **Marry actions**: Talia marries both Rory and Vince, which fulfills her desire for happiness through relationships. Since she is already wealthy due to the treasure, this completes her goal.
