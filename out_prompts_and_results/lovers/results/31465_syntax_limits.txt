In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex is currently unhappy because they want item I3 (chocolates), which is with Casey. To achieve Blake's goal, Blake can help Alex get the item they want.

**Story Completion:**
1. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I3) they picked up from Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Alex (C1) has. This action allows Alex to receive the chocolates they want, making them happy. Since Blake also wants Alex to be happy, this action fulfills both of their desires.

**Explanation of the Action:**
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the item they want (chocolates) while also receiving something in return (jewelry). This satisfies both characters' goals: Alex becomes happy with the chocolates, and Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.
