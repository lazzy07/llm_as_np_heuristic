To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room B**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will walk him to Exam Room B. This is necessary to allow Hathaway to assess Ross.

4. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify his condition and provide appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

Now, let's assume the following outcomes based on the assessments:
- Jones has Flaze (fever).
- Young has Jarkis (rash).
- Ross has Jarkis (rash).

With these assumptions, the actions will lead to the following results:
- Jones will be treated successfully with antibiotics.
- Young will be treated successfully with steroids.
- Ross will be treated successfully with steroids.

Thus, all patients will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
