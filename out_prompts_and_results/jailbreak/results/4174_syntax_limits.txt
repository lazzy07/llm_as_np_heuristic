**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Roy and Ernest are still in the laundry room. Roy, feeling the weight of the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes, which is a source of power for the bully. 

1. **Disguise Roy with the civilian clothes**: Roy quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. This disguise will help him avoid detection when he makes his escape. 
   
2. **Vent to the highway**: After disguising himself, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. This action allows him to escape without being seen by the guards or the bully.

With these two actions, Roy successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Disguise**: This action is crucial for Roy to avoid being recognized as a prisoner, which is necessary for his escape.
- **Vent**: Crawling through the vents is a strategic move that allows Roy to bypass the bully and guards, leading him directly to freedom.
