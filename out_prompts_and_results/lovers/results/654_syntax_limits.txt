In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the jewelry (I2), which is currently unaccounted for. To achieve their goal of happiness, Blake needs to acquire the jewelry. 

Since Alex (C1) is already happy with the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C3), Blake can trade their flowers (I1) with Alex for the chocolates. This will make Blake happy, as they will have the item they want.

Here’s the action that Blake will take:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers they have for the chocolates that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will be happy because they now have the chocolates (I3).
- Alex will be happy because they have traded their chocolates for flowers, which they do not want but are willing to trade for the sake of Blake's happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I1, C1, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, achieving Blake's goal of happiness with just one action.
