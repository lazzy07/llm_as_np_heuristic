To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and does not have a sword. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp and take the coins from the chest. This action ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin collection.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The bandit, having already robbed Tom of his coin, now has one coin in her possession.
- The bandit then decides to return to her camp to secure her coins. She walks to the bandit camp and takes the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
