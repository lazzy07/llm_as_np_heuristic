The bandit is at the crossroads, armed with her sword. She sees the merchant's body lying on the ground, and she knows that the medicine is now unguarded. The bandit walks over to the merchant's corpse and loots the medicine. With this action, the bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, as the medicine is valuable and can be sold for coins later.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the merchant's corpse.
2. The bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse.

These actions are necessary because they allow the bandit to acquire the medicine, which she can later sell for coins, thus fulfilling her goal of having coins.
