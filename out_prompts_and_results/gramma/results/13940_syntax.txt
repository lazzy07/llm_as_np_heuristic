To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront Tom and the Merchant, as she needs to take action to acquire coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying a coin. This action is possible because Tom is not armed with a sword. The Bandit will take Tom's coin, increasing her total.
