Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to take action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients waiting in Admissions, as both Jones and Young are there and need to be assigned to exam rooms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can begin the process of assessing and treating him. This also reduces the number of patients waiting in Admissions.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones in his assigned exam room.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - Assessing Jones is crucial to determine his symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C with antibiotics.**  
   - Since Jones is experiencing the unknown symptoms, and given that he is the only patient treated, Dr. Hathaway assumes he has Flaze (the only disease with a fever symptom) and treats him accordingly. This action is essential for achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

After these actions, Jones is treated successfully, and Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of making a patient healthy.
