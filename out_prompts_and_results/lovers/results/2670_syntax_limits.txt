To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). Given the current situation, I1 is in the same room as Alex (R22). 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I1) with Casey for the flowers (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry, while also ensuring that Casey is happy with the flowers.

After this action, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, and Casey will also be happy because they have the flowers.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade**: This action is chosen because it allows both Alex and Casey to achieve their happiness simultaneously. Alex gets the jewelry they want, and Casey receives the flowers, which they desire.
