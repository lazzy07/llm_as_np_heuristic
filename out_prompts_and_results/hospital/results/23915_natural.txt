**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze instead of Jarkis. 

2. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment for Flaze. However, since Young actually has Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now realizing the urgency of the situation, walks back to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C, where he can be assessed and treated.

5. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze.

7. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment. Since Ross does not have Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

8. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Jones.

9. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze.

10. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment. Since Jones does not have Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

At the end of the story, Dr. Hathaway has treated all patients, but due to her high workload and mistakes, all patients have died. However, she has done her best to help them, achieving her goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, even if the outcome was tragic.
