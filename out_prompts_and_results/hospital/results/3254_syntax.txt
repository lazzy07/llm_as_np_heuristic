To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room as well. This is important to identify Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Once Hathaway has assessed Ross and determined his symptoms, they will treat him accordingly. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross's health.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young based on his symptoms. This is essential to ensure Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can effectively assess and treat both patients, ensuring they both recover and achieve their goal of being healthy.
