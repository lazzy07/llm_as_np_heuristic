To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 2, they can assess Ross in PatientRoomC. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Jones**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can then assess Jones in the Admissions room. This will help identify Jones's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment as well.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB. This is crucial to determine Young's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis; if he has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Jones based on his symptoms. The same logic applies here: if Jones has a rash, he will be treated with steroids; if he has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics.

6. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on his symptoms. The same treatment logic applies.

By following this sequence, all patients will be assessed and treated correctly, ensuring they all achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
