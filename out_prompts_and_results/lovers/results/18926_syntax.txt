To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Casey (C2) moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R11) where Alex (C1) and the item (I1) are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially trade or receive the item.

2. **give(C1, I3, C2, R11)**: Alex (C1) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R11). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they do not have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C3) is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates (I2).
- Casey (C2) is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
