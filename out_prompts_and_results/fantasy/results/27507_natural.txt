To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to return to Talia, who is at the village, and to access the money that Talia has.

2. **Rory takes the money from Talia.**  
   - Rory needs to acquire wealth, and since Talia has the money, this action allows Rory to achieve that goal.

3. **Rory becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to reflect Rory's state, as he has not eaten since he was at the cave. It is necessary for the story to show Rory's hunger status.

4. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action is included to fulfill Gargax's goal of not being hungry. It also serves to illustrate the consequences of Rory's actions and the dangers present in the story.

5. **Talia takes the treasure from the dead body of Rory.**  
   - After Rory is eaten by Gargax, Talia can take the treasure from Rory's body. This action is necessary for Talia to gain wealth, which indirectly contributes to Rory's goal of wealth through their marriage.

6. **Talia becomes happy.**  
   - This action reflects Talia's emotional state after acquiring the treasure, which is a result of her actions.

In this story, Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry is ultimately not achieved due to the fatal consequences of Gargax's actions. However, Talia's actions lead to her happiness and wealth, which indirectly fulfills Rory's goal of wealth through their marriage.
