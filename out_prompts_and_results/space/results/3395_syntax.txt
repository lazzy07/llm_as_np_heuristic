To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are not currently fighting, this action can succeed.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further solidify their friendship and to ensure they are in the same location to communicate effectively.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will also walk to the surface to join Zoe. This action is important for the same reason as Zoe's previous action; it allows them to be together and continue building their friendship.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will again attempt to make peace in the cave. This reinforces their friendly relationship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now friends and have established a safe relationship, they can work together to escape the danger.

6. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk back to the surface to escape the eruption, ensuring her safety.
