To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Alex moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake and Casey, where the flowers are currently with Blake.

2. **Alex tells Blake that the flowers are wanted.**  
   - This action is important because it clarifies to Blake that Alex desires the flowers, which may prompt Blake to consider giving them to Alex.

3. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

4. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps to set up the next steps for Blake and Casey to achieve their own happiness.

5. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to follow Casey and potentially find the chocolates, which Blake wants.

6. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the item they desire, making Blake happy.

7. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, making Casey happy.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, Blake has the chocolates and is happy, and Casey has the jewelry and is happy.
