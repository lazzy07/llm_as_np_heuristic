To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Jones's symptom is currently unknown, and identifying it is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will also assess Young in PatientRoomA to confirm his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young receives the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

3. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. Since Young's symptom is known to be SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will then assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment for Ross as well.

5. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. Since Ross's symptom is SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
