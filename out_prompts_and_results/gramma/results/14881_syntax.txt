To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk back to the Camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to ensure that the coins are safely stored and not at risk of being lost or stolen.
