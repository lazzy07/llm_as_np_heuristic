To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant was located and where the hero is currently present.

2. **The bandit attacks the hero.**  
   - The bandit is armed and can attack the hero, who is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to eliminate the hero and take the hero's coin.

3. **The bandit loots the hero's corpse.**  
   - After defeating the hero, the bandit can loot the hero's corpse to take the hero's coin, which adds to the bandit's total coins.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to the camp with the newly acquired coin.

5. **The bandit places the coin in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the hero, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the coin. 
- By attacking the hero, the bandit can eliminate the threat and gain the coin without any risk of retaliation since the hero is unarmed.
- Looting the hero's corpse is a necessary step to collect the coin after the attack.
- Finally, returning to the bandit camp and placing the coin in the chest fulfills the bandit's goal of accumulating wealth.
