In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Market, where she has the opportunity to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. The Bandit can take advantage of the chaos created by Tom's attack on her, as well as the presence of the Guard, who is focused on eliminating criminals.

### Story Completion:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit can rob the Merchant, who is unarmed and has coins. This action allows the Bandit to acquire the coins she desires without directly confronting the Guard or risking her own life.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit can walk to the Bandit Camp and place the coins in the chest, ensuring that she has successfully secured her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to acquire coins without engaging in a lethal confrontation. The Merchant is unarmed, making her an easy target for robbery, and this action directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of carrying coins.

- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to secure her stolen coins in a safe location (the chest at the Bandit Camp). By doing this, she ensures that her goal of having coins is achieved and protected from any potential threats.
