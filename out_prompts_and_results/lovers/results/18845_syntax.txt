To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** This action is necessary because it creates a belief in Casey that Alex wants the item that Casey also wants, which can lead to a trade or a transfer of items.

2. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.** Since Blake is in the same room as Casey and has the jewelry, this action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

3. **Alex moves to the living room.** This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but can be included to show that Alex is still engaged in the situation and may help facilitate future interactions.

4. **Blake moves to the living room.** This action allows Blake to be in the same room as Alex, which could lead to further interactions that might help Alex achieve their own happiness later.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **tell(Blake, Casey, I3, R22)** - Blake informs Casey about Alex's supposed desire for the jewelry, which influences Casey's perception and actions.
2. **give(Blake, I3, Casey, R22)** - Blake gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.

After these actions, Casey is happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(Blake, Casey, I3, R22)",
    "give(Blake, I3, Casey, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by receiving the item they desire.
