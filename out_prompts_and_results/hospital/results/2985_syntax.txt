To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room A**: Young will walk from the admissions room to Exam Room A to be assessed next. This is necessary to ensure that Young also receives the care he needs.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is important for Young's health.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Young also has a chance to be healthy.
