To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with either antibiotics (if Young has Flaze) or steroids (if Young has Jarkis). This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomB**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway needs to admit Jones to an exam room to assess and treat him. 

4. **Admit Jones to PatientRoomB**: This action allows Hathaway to assign Jones to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

5. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms, which is necessary for providing the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

7. **Walk Ross from Admissions to PatientRoomC**: Similar to Jones, Ross needs to be moved from the admissions room to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

8. **Admit Ross to PatientRoomC**: This action assigns Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

9. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms, which is necessary for providing the correct treatment.

10. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on his symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, achieving the goal of making them healthy.
