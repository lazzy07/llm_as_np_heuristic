To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This will help determine Young's symptoms and ensure that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment as well. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat both patients, ensuring they are healthy.
