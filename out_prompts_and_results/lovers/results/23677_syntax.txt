To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, while Casey (C3) is happy with the item they have (I3). Blake (C2) is also not happy, as they want chocolates (I2), which are currently in the dining room (R21).

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates (I2) since they want to be happy.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake returns to the room where Alex and Casey are.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey, making Casey happy.
5. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to get the jewelry (I1).
6. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room.
7. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex returns to the room where Casey and Blake are.
8. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex keeps the jewelry (I1) for themselves, making Alex happy.

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has the jewelry they wanted, Casey has the chocolates, and Blake is satisfied as well.
