To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to head towards the crossroads, which is the only path available to reach the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom will walk to the cottage, where he wants to be.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage with the medicine he purchased. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's goal, as they are either focused on their own objectives or are not in a position to act against him.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market and head towards the cottage, as he cannot go directly from the market to the cottage.
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is the final step for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, where he will have the medicine.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
