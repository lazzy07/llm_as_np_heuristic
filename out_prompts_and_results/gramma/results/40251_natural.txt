The bandit, having just purchased the medicine from the merchant, now seeks to maximize her coin collection. She knows that the guard is at the market and is unaware of her criminal activities. The bandit decides to take advantage of the situation.

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp where she can safely store her newly acquired medicine and any coins she may have.

2. **The bandit loots the coin from the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to collect the coins she had previously stored in the chest, thus increasing her total coin count.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she now has the coins from the chest along with the medicine she purchased.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action of walking to the bandit camp is necessary for the bandit to secure her items and avoid any confrontation with the guard.
- The second action of looting the coins from the chest is essential for the bandit to fulfill her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
