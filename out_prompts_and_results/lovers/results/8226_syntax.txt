To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that Casey (C3) has the jewelry, but it is not clear where it is located. Since we know that Casey is in the same room as Alex and Blake, we can facilitate a trade between Blake and Casey to ensure Blake gets the jewelry.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the jewelry. This action is necessary to communicate their desire and to prompt Casey to consider trading.
   
2. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R22)**: Blake and Casey trade the jewelry (I2) for the chocolates (I3). This action is crucial as it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

3. **put_down(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey puts down the chocolates in the room. This action is necessary to complete the trade and ensure that the chocolates are available in the room.

4. **pick_up(C3, I2, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry after the trade. This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)",
    "trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R22)",
    "put_down(C3, I3, R22)",
    "pick_up(C3, I2, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **tell**: This action is used to express Blake's desire for the jewelry, which is essential for initiating the trade.
- **trade**: This action is the core of the plan, allowing Blake to exchange an item they have for the item they want, thus achieving their goal.
- **put_down**: This action ensures that the item being traded is placed in the room, making it available for the other character to pick up.
- **pick_up**: This action allows Casey to acquire the jewelry after the trade, ensuring that both characters are satisfied with the outcome. 

By following this sequence, Blake successfully achieves their goal of happiness.
