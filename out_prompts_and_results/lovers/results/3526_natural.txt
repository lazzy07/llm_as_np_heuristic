To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Alex that the flowers are in the living room.** (Blake believes that Alex wants the flowers, and this action is necessary to mislead Alex into thinking the flowers are accessible.)
   
2. **Alex moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Alex believes the flowers are in the living room and wants to go there to get them.)

3. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.** (This action allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the flowers.)

4. **Alex moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to return to the bathroom after obtaining the flowers.)

5. **Alex puts down the flowers in the bathroom.** (This action is included to show that Alex has successfully obtained the flowers and can now be happy.)
