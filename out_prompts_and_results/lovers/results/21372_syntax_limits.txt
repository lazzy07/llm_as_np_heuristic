In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and it is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the jewelry from Casey. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the flowers (I3) they believe Casey has for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (jewelry) while giving Casey an item they might want (flowers).

The action sequence is as follows:

- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the flowers they believe they have for the jewelry that Casey has. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the jewelry they wanted.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (chocolates, I2).
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy as well, since they do not have the item they want (chocolates, I2).

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
