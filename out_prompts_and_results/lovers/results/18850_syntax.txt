To ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Casey is currently happy with the jewelry (I3), we can facilitate a trade between Casey and Alex. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is essential for their happiness.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will still be happy.
- Blake's happiness is not directly affected in this scenario, but since Alex is happy, it indirectly contributes to Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R12)**: This action allows Alex to get the flowers they want, achieving their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R12)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
