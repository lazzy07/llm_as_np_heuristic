To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money without resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action ensures that Bubba ends up with the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk to eliminate any threat and gain access to the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba picks up the money after shooting the clerk, achieving the goal of having the money.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba has the money and Bambi is already dead.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
