As the day progressed, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, felt a surge of determination. He knew that Ernest was in the kitchen, threatened by the bully, and he had to act quickly to ensure both of their survival. 

Roy decided to crawl back through the vent to the gym. He knew the bully was there, and he had a plan. Once he reached the gym, he quietly locked the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. The bully, realizing he was locked in, turned to confront Roy, but Roy was ready. He swiftly pulled out the knife he had stolen from the kitchen earlier that day.
