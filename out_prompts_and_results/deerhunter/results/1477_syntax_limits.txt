To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the Forest to the Bank. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to confront the bank clerk to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money, thus ensuring that Bubba can take the money without any resistance.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk. This action is the final step to achieve the goal of Bubba having the money.

By executing these actions, Bubba will end up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- The first action is necessary to get to the location where the money is held.
- The second action is essential to remove the obstacle (the clerk) and gain access to the money.
- The third action allows Bubba to take the money, achieving the goal of the story.
