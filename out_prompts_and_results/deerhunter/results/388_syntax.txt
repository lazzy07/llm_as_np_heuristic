To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now steal the money from the dead clerk. This action directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba returns to the forest with the stolen money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the clerk to access the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba takes the money from the dead clerk, achieving the goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank, concluding the story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
