**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway proceeds with the assessment. 

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect since Ross actually has Flaze. As a result, Ross dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Young. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. 

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. With a workload of 2, Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
