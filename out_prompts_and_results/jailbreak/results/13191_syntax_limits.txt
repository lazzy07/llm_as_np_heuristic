**Story Completion:**

After successfully disguising himself in civilian clothes, Roy crawls through the vents from the hallway to the highway. He knows that this is his chance to escape the prison and leave behind the threats posed by the bully and the harsh prison life. 

Once he reaches the highway, he takes a moment to ensure that no guards are in sight. With a deep breath, he steps out of the shadows and onto the open road, feeling the weight of his prison life lift off his shoulders. He has successfully escaped.
