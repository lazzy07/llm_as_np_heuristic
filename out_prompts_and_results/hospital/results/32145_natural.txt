**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Admissions, sees that both Jones and Ross are waiting. Since Young is already in Patient Room B, Hathaway decides to admit Ross to Patient Room A to assess him. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed for his symptoms.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** (This action is crucial to determine Ross's symptoms so that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** (Assuming Ross has a rash, this treatment is necessary to ensure he becomes healthy.)

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** (Assuming Young has a fever, this treatment is necessary to ensure he becomes healthy.)

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.)

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** (Assuming Jones has a fever, this treatment is necessary to ensure he becomes healthy.)
