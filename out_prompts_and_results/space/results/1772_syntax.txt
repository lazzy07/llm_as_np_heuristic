To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion. The actions will be carefully chosen to achieve the desired ending.

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are already in the same location (the cave) and not fighting, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends and ensures they are not enemies.

2. **Erupt the volcano**: After making peace, the volcano on the surface will erupt. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

3. **Zoe teleports to the surface**: Zoe will teleport from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary because it places her in the dangerous environment where the eruption will occur.

4. **Lizard remains in the cave**: The Lizard will stay in the cave, which is a safe location during the eruption. This action is implied as the Lizard's choice to remain safe while Zoe is in danger.

5. **Eruption occurs**: The volcano erupts, and since Zoe is on the surface, she will die as a result of the eruption.

The final sequence of actions is as follows:

1. make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)
2. erupt(Surface)
3. teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)

This sequence ensures that the characters achieve their goals of friendship while also leading to the eruption and Zoe's demise.
