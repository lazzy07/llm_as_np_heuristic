Tom, having just purchased the medicine, is determined to return to the cottage. He knows that the bandit is at the market, and he fears for his safety. To ensure he can safely return home, he decides to report the bandit to the guard, who is also at the market.

1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** This action is crucial because it alerts the guard to the presence of a criminal, allowing the guard to take action against the bandit. This ensures Tom's safety as he makes his way back to the cottage.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.** The guard, now aware of the bandit's presence, moves to confront her, which further secures the area for Tom.

3. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** With the guard now on the way to deal with the bandit, Tom can safely return to the cottage carrying the medicine.

By reporting the bandit, Tom ensures that he can achieve his goal of returning to the cottage without the threat of the bandit.
