**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take a risk. He crawls through the vents from the highway back into the prison. He knows that Ernest is in the kitchen and that the bully is in the gym, but he also knows that he needs to help his friend. 

Once in the hallway, Roy quickly moves to the gym and locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. The bully, surprised and furious, turns to confront Roy. However, Roy has a plan. He pulls out the knife he had stolen earlier from the kitchen. 

With the bully cornered and no way to escape, Roy takes a deep breath and kills the bully, finally freeing himself and Ernest from the threat that has loomed over them. 

Now, with the bully out of the way, Roy can safely return to the highway, put on his civilian clothes, and escape from the prison.
