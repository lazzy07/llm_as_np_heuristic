To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Young is necessary to identify if they have Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a fever (indicating Flaze), they will treat Young with antibiotics. This will make Young healthy.

3. **Walk to Exam Room C and Assess Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room C to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Hathaway identifies Jones's symptoms as a rash (indicating Jarkis), they will treat Jones with steroids, making Jones healthy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat both Young and Jones, achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
