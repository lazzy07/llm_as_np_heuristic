To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the best course of action is to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is taken to solidify the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. Since they are not fighting and have a positive relationship, this action will help them both feel safe and secure.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship. This ensures her safety, as the surface is currently dangerous.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **make_peace**: This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be friends. By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a positive relationship, which is essential for Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe. Since the surface is dangerous, returning to the spaceship ensures her health and safety.
