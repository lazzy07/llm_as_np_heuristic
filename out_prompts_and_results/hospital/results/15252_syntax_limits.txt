Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room B, where Young is assigned but not yet assessed. Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there's a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to reduce their workload and assess the patients.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This action is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to start the process.

2. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has Jarkis (rash) and treats them with steroids. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition, ensuring they become healthy.

3. **Walk to Patient Room A to assess Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross. This action is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully reduces their workload and treats Young correctly, which is a step towards achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
