To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. He is also greedy and desires money. Bambi is also in the forest, alive, and poses no immediate threat to Bubba's goals.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, being hungry and greedy, will decide to shoot Bambi. This action will result in Bambi being dead, which satisfies one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank to confront the clerk.

5. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank, achieving his goal of having money.
