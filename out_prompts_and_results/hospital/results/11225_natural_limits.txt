Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their conditions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Young to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can begin to address Young's unknown condition, which is crucial for ensuring all patients are treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient in Patient Room A, it is essential to assess him to provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will make Jones healthy. This action is critical for achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones, and Young is now assigned to an exam room for further assessment and treatment.
