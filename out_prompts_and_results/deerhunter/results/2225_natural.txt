To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and wants to have money, while the clerk has the money. Bubba is also hungry, which may influence his actions.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to have a loaded gun to either threaten the clerk or to shoot Bambi later if he decides to go back to the forest.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba needs to leave the bank to avoid any potential consequences from the clerk.

4. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - This action is taken to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the ending condition. Bubba can shoot Bambi because he has a loaded rifle.

5. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry, and now that Bambi is dead, he can eat.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Load ammunition into the rifle:** Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **Steal the money from the clerk:** Directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Go from the bank to the forest:** Moves Bubba to a new location after committing the theft.
- **Shoot Bambi:** Ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the ending condition.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** Satisfies Bubba's hunger by utilizing the dead animal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load ammunition into the rifle",
    "steal the money from the clerk",
    "go from the bank to the forest",
    "shoot Bambi",
    "decide to eat Bambi"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead, achieving the desired ending of the story.
