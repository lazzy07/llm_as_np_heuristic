To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake in diagnosis. However, we will assume that Ross has a rash (symptom of Jarkis) and Hathaway correctly assesses him.
2. **Treat Ross with steroids**: This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and it will make Ross healthy.
3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess Young.
4. **Admit Young to PatientRoomA**: This will allow Hathaway to assign Young to an exam room.
5. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms.
6. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: Assuming Young has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway will treat Young with the correct medication.

Now, let's outline the actions taken and their reasoning:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, rash, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition. Since he has a rash, Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Jarkis.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: This action treats Ross for Jarkis, making him healthy.
3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway needs to return to the admissions room to assess Young.
4. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomA)**: This action assigns Young to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to treat him.
5. **assess(Hathaway, Young, fever, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms, which we assume is a fever.
6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: This action treats Young for Flaze, making him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
