**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that there are three patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, Hathaway believes Jones is alive and will proceed to treat him with antibiotics, mistakenly thinking he has Flaze. This action reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B. Again, Ross's symptoms are unknown, but Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This also reduces Hathaway's workload to 1.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C. Young's symptoms are still unknown, but Hathaway treats him with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. This reduces Hathaway's workload to 0.

At the end of these actions, all patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully managed to treat all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring they are healthy.
