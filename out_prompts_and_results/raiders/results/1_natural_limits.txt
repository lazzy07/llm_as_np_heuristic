**Story Completion:**

Indiana Jones, realizing the danger of the Ark being in the hands of the Nazis, decides to travel to Tanis to confront them. He knows that the U.S. Army is also interested in the Ark, so he hopes to get there before the Nazis can open it.

1. **Indiana travels to Tanis.** (This action is necessary for Indiana to confront the Nazis and prevent them from opening the Ark.)
   
Upon arriving at Tanis, Indiana finds the Nazis preparing to dig up the Ark. He knows he must act quickly.

2. **Indiana takes the Ark from the Nazis by force.** (Since the Nazis are armed, Indiana must use force to take the Ark before they can open it.)

With the Ark in his possession, Indiana quickly travels back to the USA, where he knows the U.S. Army is stationed.

Once in the USA, Indiana approaches the U.S. Army and hands over the Ark.

4. **Indiana gives the Ark to the U.S. Army.** (This action fulfills Indiana's goal of ensuring the Ark is in safe hands.)

Meanwhile, the Nazis, realizing they have lost the Ark, attempt to follow Indiana back to the USA. However, they are intercepted by the U.S. Army, who are now armed and ready.

5. **The U.S. Army takes the Nazis by force.** (This action is necessary to eliminate the threat posed by the Nazis, ensuring they cannot pursue Indiana or the Ark.)

In the ensuing confrontation, the U.S. Army successfully neutralizes the Nazis, ensuring they cannot threaten anyone again.

6. **The U.S. Army kills the Nazis.** (This action ensures that the Nazis are dead, achieving the story's goal.)
