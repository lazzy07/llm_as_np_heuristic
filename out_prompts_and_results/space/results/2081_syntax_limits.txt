In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard, while the Lizard also desires safety and friendship.

To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and one character dies, we can have Zoe take the action of walking to the surface, where the volcano is erupting. This action will lead to the eruption causing danger, and since Zoe is on the surface when it erupts, she will die. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface, where the volcano is erupting. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the location where the eruption will occur.

After this action, the volcano erupts, and since Zoe is on the surface, she dies. The Lizard remains safe on the surface, and while they do not become friends in this scenario, the story ends with the eruption and Zoe's death.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcome of the volcano erupting and a character dying, while keeping the story concise.
