Tom, realizing the danger at the crossroads with the bandit present, decides to take action. He quickly walks back to the market to alert the guard about the bandit. This action is crucial because it helps Tom achieve his goal of getting the medicine from the merchant, who is now dead, but the guard can still deal with the bandit.

After reporting the bandit to the guard, the guard, armed and ready, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit. This action is necessary as it allows the guard to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit, ensuring Tom's safety.

Once the bandit is dealt with, Tom can safely return to the crossroads, where he can now retrieve the medicine from the merchant's body. This final action allows Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Tom walks from the crossroads to the market to report the bandit to the guard.
2. The guard walks from the market to the crossroads to confront the bandit.
3. The guard attacks and kills the bandit.
4. Tom walks from the crossroads to the merchant's body to retrieve the medicine.

This sequence ensures that Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine while eliminating the threat of the bandit.
