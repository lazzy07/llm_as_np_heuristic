To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The current situation shows that Alex is in the same room as Casey and Blake, and Casey is holding the jewelry. 

The simplest action to achieve Alex's goal is for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

However, since the goal is to make Alex happy, this action successfully achieves that.
