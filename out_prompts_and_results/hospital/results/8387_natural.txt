**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Jones to an exam room. She assigns him to Exam Room B. This action increases her workload to 3, but she believes it is necessary to assess all patients.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. She finds that Young is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. She treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. This reduces her workload back to 2.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Ross. She finds that Ross is also experiencing a fever, mistakenly believing he has Flaze due to her increased workload. She treats Ross with antibiotics, but since he actually has Jarkis, he unfortunately dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Jones. She finds that Jones is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. She treats Jones with steroids, successfully making him healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has treated two patients successfully, achieving her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
