Zoe looks around at the erupting surface and realizes that both she and the Lizard are in danger. To ensure their safety, she decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can be safe from the eruption. Since she and the Lizard are friends, she invites the Lizard to join her on the ship. The Lizard, understanding the urgency, agrees and they both teleport to the spaceship together.
