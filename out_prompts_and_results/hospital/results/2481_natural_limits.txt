Dr. Hathaway, realizing that all patients are still in the admissions room and experiencing unknown symptoms, decides to take action to ensure their health. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary to start the assessment and treatment process for Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. It also increases Hathaway's workload to 4, but this is acceptable for the moment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** This action allows Hathaway to manage Young's case as well, ensuring that all patients are being attended to. The workload increases to 5, but Hathaway is focused on treating the patients.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross, who is now in Patient Room A.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Given that Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the assumption that he might have either Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze with antibiotics.** Since Ross's symptoms were unknown, Hathaway takes a chance and treats him for Flaze. If Ross had Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he may not survive. However, this is a necessary risk to ensure that at least one patient is treated.

After these actions, if Ross had Flaze, he becomes healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring patient health. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Admitting Ross and Young allows Hathaway to start the treatment process.
- Walking to Patient Room A is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross.
- Assessing Ross is critical to determine the appropriate treatment.
- Treating Ross is the final step to ensure at least one patient is healthy.
