**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Roy is still in the laundry room, unaware of the danger that lurks in the gym. Meanwhile, Ernest, who is in the hallway, knows that the bully is in the gym and is a threat to both him and Roy. To ensure their safety and to get the pack of cigarettes, Ernest decides to take action.

Ernest locks the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from coming after them and gives them a moment of respite. With the bully locked away, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison.

On day two, Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
