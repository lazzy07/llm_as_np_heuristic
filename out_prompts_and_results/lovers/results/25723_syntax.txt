To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3 - jewelry), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R21, R11)**: Blake moves to the room where Casey is located (R11). This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R11)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making Casey happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is happy because they have given away the jewelry (I3) to Casey.
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions is the shortest and most efficient way to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
