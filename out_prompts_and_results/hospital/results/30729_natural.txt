**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (fever) instead of Jarkis (rash). 

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment for Flaze. However, since Young actually has Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now aware that she needs to address the other patients, walks back to the Admissions room to assess Jones.

4. **Admit Jones to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A, increasing her workload to 3 again.

5. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Jones.

6. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze.

7. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment for Flaze. Since Jones does not have Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

8. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross.

9. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze.

10. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment for Flaze. Since Ross does not have Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

At the end of the story, Dr. Hathaway has treated all patients, albeit incorrectly, but she has done her best to help them. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young, Jones, and Ross is necessary to determine their conditions, even though mistakes are made due to the high workload.
- Treating each patient is essential to attempt to cure them, even if the treatments are incorrect.
- Walking between rooms is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach each patient and perform her duties.
