To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness. The key to Rory's wealth lies in acquiring the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Rory to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can provide him with wealth.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village. This action is necessary for Rory to be in a location where he can interact with other characters and potentially secure his wealth further.

3. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body in the village. This action is necessary because it allows Rory to increase his wealth further, ensuring he has both the treasure and the money.

After these actions, Rory will have both the treasure and the money, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy. He is already happy due to his marriage to Talia, and he is not hungry since he has not taken any actions that would lead to hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is essential for Rory to gain wealth, as the treasure is the only item that can provide him with wealth.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to return to the village to interact with the money that is with Vince.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Rory to acquire the money, thus increasing his wealth.
