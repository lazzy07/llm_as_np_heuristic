To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify Young's condition and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery.
