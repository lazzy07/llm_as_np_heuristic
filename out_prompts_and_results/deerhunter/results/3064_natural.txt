To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, being hungry and wanting money, will decide to steal from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

3. **Bubba goes to the forest**: After stealing the money, Bubba will go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but serves to remove Bubba from the bank, where he might be confronted by the clerk.

4. **Bubba decides to eat**: In the forest, Bubba can decide to eat, which is a natural action for someone who is hungry. However, since Bambi is alive in the forest, this action does not lead to Bambi being dead.

5. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: Bubba, still in the forest, can shoot Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money he stole from the clerk, and Bambi is dead, satisfying both conditions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal**: Bubba's goal is to have money, and stealing is the quickest way to achieve that.
- **Steal the money**: This action directly gives Bubba the money he desires.
- **Go to the forest**: This action helps Bubba avoid potential confrontation with the clerk after stealing.
