To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Given the current situation, Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, he is hungry, and since he is in the forest with Bambi, he might consider eating.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and wants to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot Bambi, who is alive in the forest.)
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the animal to satisfy his hunger.)

Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and has also satisfied his hunger by eating. The clerk remains at the bank, and Bambi is no longer alive.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and wants to eat.
- **Shoot Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to kill Bambi, which is necessary for him to eat.
- **Eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger after he has killed Bambi.
