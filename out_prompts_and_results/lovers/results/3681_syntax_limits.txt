In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the item they desire, which is the flowers (I1). Currently, Alex is in the living room (R21) and believes that the flowers are with Casey (C3) in the same room. 

To achieve their goal, Alex can simply ask Casey to give them the flowers. Since Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy, and since Blake is not currently in the room, Casey is likely to comply with Alex's request.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy. Since Alex's happiness is the goal of the story, this single action is sufficient to achieve that.

- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This action allows Casey to give the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). By doing this, Alex receives the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
