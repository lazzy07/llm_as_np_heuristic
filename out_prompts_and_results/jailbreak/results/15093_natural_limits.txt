**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, still in the kitchen, realized he needed to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decided to sneak through the hallway to the gym, where the bully was currently occupying his time. 

Roy moved stealthily through the hallway, clutching the knife tightly. He knew that confronting the bully was risky, but it was the only way to eliminate the threat. Once he reached the gym, he locked the door behind him, ensuring they would not be interrupted. 

With the knife in hand, Roy confronted the bully. The bully, surprised by Roy's sudden appearance, attempted to threaten him, but Roy was quicker. In a swift motion, he used the knife to kill the bully, finally freeing himself and Ernest from the constant threat.

With the bully out of the way, Roy could now focus on escaping with Ernest. He quickly put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself. 

Now, with the gym door locked and the bully dead, Roy made his way back to the hallway, ready to escape to the highway with Ernest.
