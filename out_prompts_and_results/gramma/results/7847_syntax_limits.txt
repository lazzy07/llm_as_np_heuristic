To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. Since he has already looted the medicine from the merchant, he can simply walk to the Cottage to fulfill his goal.

This action is necessary because it directly leads Tom to his desired location with the medicine he needs.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the action:

Tom, having just left the market where he acquired a sword and looted some medicine from the merchant, stands at the crossroads. He knows that his ultimate goal is to return to the cottage with the medicine. Without any further conflict or need for additional actions, he decides to walk directly to the cottage.
