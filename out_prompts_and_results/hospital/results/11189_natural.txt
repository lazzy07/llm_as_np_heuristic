**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being 2. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition. However, since Jones is alive, he survives the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions to assess Ross. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Again, due to the workload being 2, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Ross survives the treatment as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is experiencing Unknown, and Hathaway, still under the mistaken belief that Young has Jarkis, treats him with steroids. Young also survives the treatment.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
