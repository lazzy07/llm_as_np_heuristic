In this story, the Merchant's goal is to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, and she prefers to be at the market. The Merchant has already taken one BanditCoin from the Bandit and is currently at the Crossroads. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks to the Market, where she can be in her preferred location and potentially find more opportunities to earn coins without engaging in criminal activity.

This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to be in a location where she can interact with other characters and conduct business, thus maximizing her chances of acquiring more coins.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)"]
}
``` 

This single action effectively fulfills the Merchant's goal of being at the Market while keeping her criminal status intact.
