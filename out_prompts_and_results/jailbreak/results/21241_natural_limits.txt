**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison comes to a close, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realizes he must act quickly. He knows that Ernest is in the cells, threatened by the bully, and he cannot let that continue. 

Roy decides to take a risk. He uses the knife he knows is in the kitchen to kill the bully. With the bully out of the way, Roy can ensure both he and Ernest are safe. 

After successfully killing the bully, Roy unlocks the gym door and rushes to the hallway. He then crawls through the vents to reach the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he escapes from the prison, finally achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
