Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to make his escape. He knows that the bully is locked in the gym and cannot threaten him while he is outside. With the knife in hand, he crawls through the vents from the kitchen to the highway. Once he reaches the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise. With the bully occupied and unable to threaten him, Ernest successfully escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Crawl through the vents to the highway**: This action allows Ernest to bypass the bully and the guards, ensuring he is not threatened during his escape.
2. **Put on the civilian clothes**: This disguises Ernest, making it safe for him to be on the highway without the risk of being recognized as a prisoner.
