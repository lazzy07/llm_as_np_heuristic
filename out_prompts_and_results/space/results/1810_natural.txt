Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and now they need to ensure their safety while also fostering their newfound friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the immediate danger of the erupting volcano. Since she is not safe on the surface, teleporting to the spaceship will protect her.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship back to the surface.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard. This action is important because Zoe wants to maintain her friendship with the Lizard and ensure that they can work together to stay safe.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - By walking to the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can find shelter from the erupting volcano. This action helps both characters stay safe and allows them to continue their friendship in a secure environment.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures they can work together to face any future challenges.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
