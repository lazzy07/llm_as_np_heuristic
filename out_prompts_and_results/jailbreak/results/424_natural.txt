**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest remains in the cell block, feeling the weight of the cigarettes in his pocket. He knows the bully is angry and that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's safety. Meanwhile, Roy, having completed his chores in the laundry room, decides to take a risk.

1. **Roy moves to the kitchen.** (Roy needs to get the knife to protect himself and Ernest from the bully.)
2. **Roy steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
3. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (Roy needs to get closer to Ernest to help him.)
4. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to surprise the bully and protect Ernest.)
5. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that Roy can confront him.)
6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to Ernest without fear. They can share the cigarettes and plan their next move together, knowing they are safe from the bully's threats.
