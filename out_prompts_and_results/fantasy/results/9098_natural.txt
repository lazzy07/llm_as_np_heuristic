To achieve Vince's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to ensure he acquires the treasure and maintains his happiness. Since Talia and Rory are already married, Vince's happiness can be achieved through wealth and not hunger. 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Vince's goal:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** (This action is necessary for Vince to reach the treasure.)
2. **Vince picks up the treasure.** (This action allows Vince to become wealthy.)
3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (This action is necessary for Vince to return to the village with the treasure.)
4. **Vince proposes to Talia.** (This action is necessary for Vince to increase his happiness through a relationship.)
5. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** (This action ensures that both characters are happy.)
6. **Vince and Talia get married.** (This action solidifies their relationship, contributing to Vince's happiness.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Traveling to the cave** is essential for Vince to access the treasure, which is crucial for his wealth.
- **Picking up the treasure** directly contributes to Vince's goal of being wealthy.
- **Traveling back to the village** is necessary for Vince to be in a location where he can interact with Talia and propose.
- **Proposing to Talia** is a step towards achieving happiness through a romantic relationship.
- **Talia accepting the proposal** is crucial for both characters to achieve happiness.
- **Getting married** finalizes the relationship, ensuring Vince's happiness is fulfilled.
