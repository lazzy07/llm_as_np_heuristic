To achieve the goal of having Bubba end up with the money or ensuring Bambi is dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he is currently located and head to the bank. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to confront the bank clerk to obtain the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he will steal the money from the bank clerk using the rifle he has. This action is essential as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten Bambi, to the bank where the clerk is located. It sets up the next action where he can confront the clerk.
  
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money, achieving the goal of the story.
