To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young's symptoms are currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Young based on the assessment.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room C. This allows Hathaway to treat Jones based on the assessment.

5. **Treat Ross**: Since Ross has already been assessed and has SymptomA, Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics, as SymptomA indicates Flaze. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: After admitting Young to Exam Room B and assessing them, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms after admitting them to Exam Room C. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
