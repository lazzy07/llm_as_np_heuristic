To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and potentially trade items.

2. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they picked up earlier with Blake for the chocolates (I2). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is I3.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R22) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and allows Blake to be in a position to potentially help Alex later.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) after the trade. This action is also not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to conclude the story with all characters in the dining room.

After these actions, Casey is happy because they have the item they wanted (I3). 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to trade items.
- **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: This is the key action that allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: While this does not directly affect Casey's happiness, it allows for a logical progression of the story.
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Similar to Blake's move, this helps conclude the story with all characters in the dining room.
