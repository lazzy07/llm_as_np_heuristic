**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so he decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This action is taken to reduce his workload and attempt to help Ross, even though it may not be the correct treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young, who is experiencing Rash. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms and treats him with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. This successfully makes Young healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to check on Ross. Since Ross was treated with antibiotics, he is not healthy and unfortunately dies. However, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young, achieving his goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
