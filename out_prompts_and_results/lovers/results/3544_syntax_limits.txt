In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I1), which they already have. However, Casey is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are currently in the dining room (R21). To help Casey, Alex can tell Blake about Casey's desire for the chocolates, which will lead to a series of actions that ultimately make everyone happy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(C1, C3, I2, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the chocolates. This is a strategic move to inform Casey about their desire, which will prompt Casey to take action to obtain the chocolates.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to get the chocolates, as they now know they want them.

3. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates from the dining room.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake, who is in the dining room.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room to be with Alex and Casey.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex, making Alex happy.

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has the jewelry, Casey has the chocolates, and Blake is happy because Alex is happy.
