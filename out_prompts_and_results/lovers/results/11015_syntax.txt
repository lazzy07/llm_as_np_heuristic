To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can outline the following actions:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake (C2) can trade the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to give away an item they do not want (I1) in exchange for an item they do want (I3).

2. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: After the trade, Casey can give the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to have the item they want, which is the flowers (I1), while also ensuring that Casey has the jewelry (I3) they desire.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake can then move to the bedroom (R22) to be closer to Alex (C1). This action is necessary for Blake to be in a position to help Alex achieve their happiness.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Finally, Blake can give the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to have the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2), thus making Alex happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- **Trade**: Blake trades chocolates for flowers with Casey.
- **Give**: Casey gives jewelry to Blake.
- **Move**: Blake moves to the bedroom.
- **Give**: Blake gives chocolates to Alex.

This sequence of actions ensures that all characters achieve their goals of happiness.
