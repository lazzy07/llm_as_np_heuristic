The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the crossroads. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is carrying a sword, the bandit decides to take a risk. She approaches the hero and, with a swift motion, she attacks the hero, aiming to kill him and take the medicine he believes the merchant has. 

The hero, caught off guard, is unable to defend himself against the bandit's attack. The bandit successfully kills the hero and loots the medicine from his corpse. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit now has the means to either sell it or use it for her own purposes, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having valuable items at the bandit camp.
