Tom, armed with the bandit's sword, stands in the market alongside the merchant and the guard. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine he desires, Tom approaches her. 

**Action:** Tom uses the bandit's sword to threaten the merchant and demands the medicine.

**Explanation:** This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of obtaining the medicine. Since he is armed, he can intimidate the merchant into giving him the medicine without resorting to violence, as he is not a criminal and wants to avoid unnecessary conflict.

After successfully obtaining the medicine from the merchant, Tom walks back to the cottage, satisfied that he has achieved his goal.
