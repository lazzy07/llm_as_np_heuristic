In the cave, Gargax is feeling hungry and desires wealth. Talia and Rory are also present in the cave, but they are preoccupied with their own goals of happiness and wealth. Vince, who has the money, is still at the village. 

To achieve his goal, Gargax decides to eat Rory, who is at the cave with him. This action will not only satisfy Gargax's hunger but also eliminate a potential obstacle to his wealth, as Rory is a competitor for the treasure.
