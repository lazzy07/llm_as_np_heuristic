To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to a conclusion where the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, and the two characters making friends. 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe realizes that the Lizard is not a threat and that they both want to be healthy and safe. She decides to approach the Lizard and make peace, which will help them become friends. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where the volcano erupts, leading to a character's demise.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, being on the surface when the volcano erupts, dies. This action is included to ensure that one character dies as a result of the eruption.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **make_peace**: This action is essential as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to overcome their initial distrust and hostility, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship. It sets the stage for a positive relationship between the two characters.

- **erupt**: This action is necessary to meet the story's requirement of the volcano erupting, which creates a sense of urgency and danger in the narrative.

- **kill**: This action is included to ensure that the Lizard, who is now friends with Zoe, meets a tragic end due to the eruption, adding emotional weight to the story and highlighting the unpredictability of their environment.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of the story, fulfilling the conditions set forth in the prompt.
