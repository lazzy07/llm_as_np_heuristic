To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). Since Alex is currently in the dining room (R12) and the flowers are in the living room (C3), Alex needs to move to the living room and pick up the flowers.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with the necessary actions:

1. **move(Alex, R12, C3)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room where the flowers are located. This action is necessary for Alex to access the flowers.
2. **pick_up(Alex, I1, C3)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
