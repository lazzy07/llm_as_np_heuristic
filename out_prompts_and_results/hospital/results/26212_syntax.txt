To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is important for the same reason as above; Hathaway needs to know Young's condition to provide the right treatment.

3. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This is crucial for Young's recovery.

5. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomB**: Finally, Hathaway will walk Jones to PatientRoomB to assess him. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated and becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are healthy.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Depending on Jones's symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with either antibiotics or steroids.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their recovery.
