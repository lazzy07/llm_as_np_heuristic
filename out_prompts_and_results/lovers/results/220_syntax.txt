1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) where Alex and the jewelry (I1) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is important because it allows Casey to help Alex by giving them an item, which may lead to a positive interaction.

4. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1) while in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial as it communicates Alex's desire directly to Casey.

5. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12) from the living room (R22) to be with Alex. This is necessary for Casey to fulfill Alex's request.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This is the final action that ensures Alex receives the item they want, making them happy.
