Tom, armed with the bandit's sword and carrying the medicine, realizes that he is now a criminal after attacking the merchant. He knows he needs to get back to the cottage without drawing the guard's attention. 

To achieve his goal of returning to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the location of the bandit (who is now dead) to the guard. This action will clear his name, as he can claim he was merely a witness and not a criminal. 

The guard, believing Tom's report, will focus on the bandit and not pursue Tom for his previous actions. With the guard distracted, Tom can safely walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard:** This action helps Tom distance himself from his criminal status by providing information about the dead bandit, thus redirecting the guard's attention away from him.

After reporting, Tom walks back to the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.
