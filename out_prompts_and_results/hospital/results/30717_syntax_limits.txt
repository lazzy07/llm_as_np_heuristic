In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat too many patients. Therefore, the focus will be on assessing and treating one patient at a time.

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide treatment accordingly.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can effectively manage their workload and ensure that both Ross and Young receive the appropriate care, ultimately achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.
