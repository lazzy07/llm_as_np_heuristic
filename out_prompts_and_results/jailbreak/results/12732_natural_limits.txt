**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, still in the laundry room, realizes that the bully is furious about the stolen cigarettes. He knows he must act quickly to protect himself and Roy. Meanwhile, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take a risk. He sneaks through the vents to the kitchen, where he finds the knife. With the knife in hand, he knows he can confront the bully if necessary.

**Action 1:** Roy crawls through the vents to the kitchen and steals the knife.  
*Explanation:* This action is necessary for Roy to arm himself against the bully, who poses a significant threat to both him and Ernest.

**Action 2:** Roy then moves back to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes, and prepares to escape.  
*Explanation:* By disguising himself, Roy can safely exit the prison without being recognized by the guards or the bully, thus overcoming the threat.

As Roy successfully escapes, he leaves Ernest behind, who remains in the laundry room, unaware of the impending danger. The bully, still believing that both Ernest and Roy are in the laundry room, is left frustrated and powerless.

**Ending:** Roy escapes from the prison, while Ernest is left to face the bully alone, leading to his demise.
