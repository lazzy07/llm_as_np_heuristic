To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit needs to leave the Market, where she currently is, to reach the Crossroads. This is necessary to move towards the next step of her plan.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After reaching the Crossroads, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This is essential for her to access the chest where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.
