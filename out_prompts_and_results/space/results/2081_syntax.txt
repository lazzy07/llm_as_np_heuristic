To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard interact in a way that leads to a friendship while also ensuring the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's demise. This outcome aligns with the goal of having a character die and two characters making friends.

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.**  
   - This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing for potential interaction and conflict resolution.

2. **Zoe attacks the Lizard.**  
   - This action initiates a fight, which is a necessary step to create tension and conflict between Zoe and the Lizard. It also allows for the possibility of a resolution through friendship later.

3. **Zoe stuns the Lizard.**  
   - Stunning the Lizard prevents it from retaliating, giving Zoe the opportunity to negotiate or resolve the conflict without further violence.

4. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.**  
   - After stunning the Lizard, Zoe can choose to make peace, which allows them to become friends. This action fulfills the requirement of the characters making friends.

5. **The volcano erupts.**  
   - This action is the climax of the story, resulting in the Lizard's death. The eruption is a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption, which creates a sense of urgency and danger.

6. **The Lizard dies.**  
   - The Lizard's death occurs as a result of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, even though the Lizard ultimately dies due to the eruption. The story highlights the themes of conflict, resolution, and the fragility of life.
