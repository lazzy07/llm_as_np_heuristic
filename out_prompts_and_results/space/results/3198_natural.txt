Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the ongoing eruptions. To ensure their safety and health, they decide to move to a safer location. 

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is taken to find safety from the eruptions. The cave is a safer location where they can avoid the dangers of the surface.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring that both characters are together in a safe location.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they remain allies in the face of danger.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard decide to stay in the cave until the eruptions cease.** - This is an implied action where they choose to remain in the cave, ensuring their health and safety.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering friendship with the Lizard.
