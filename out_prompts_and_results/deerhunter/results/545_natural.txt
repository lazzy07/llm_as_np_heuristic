To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk is at the bank with 1 money, and Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This will also eliminate Bambi, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.
   
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action is necessary to achieve the goal of having Bambi dead. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger.

4. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can now take the money that he believes she has, fulfilling his goal of having money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba's hunger drives him to consider killing Bambi for food.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the required outcomes.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** Satisfying his hunger is a priority for Bubba, and eating Bambi is a logical next step after killing her.
- **Pick up the money from Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money, as he can now take whatever resources Bambi had.
