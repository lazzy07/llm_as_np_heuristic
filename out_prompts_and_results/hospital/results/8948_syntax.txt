To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to proceed with the assessment to identify the disease.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms as well. This is crucial to ensure that both patients receive the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross with steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat him with steroids. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat him with antibiotics. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
