To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Jones has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment. This is essential for Young to become healthy.

5. **Walk Ross from Admissions to PatientRoomA**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will need to admit him to an exam room to assess and treat him.

6. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

7. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure all patients are healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
