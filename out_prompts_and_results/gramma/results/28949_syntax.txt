To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market where Tom is located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to confront Tom to achieve her goal of obtaining coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he is carrying. This action is essential for the Bandit to increase her coin count, which is part of her goal.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This is necessary to return to a location where she can either store her coins or prepare to go back to the camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has obtained and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.
