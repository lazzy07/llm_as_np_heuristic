To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - Bubba is greedy and wants to have money, so he decides to take the clerk's money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to reach the location where the money is.
- **Deciding to steal** shows Bubba's intent to take the money, which aligns with his goal of becoming greedy.
- **Stealing the money** is the final action that ensures Bubba achieves his goal of having money.
