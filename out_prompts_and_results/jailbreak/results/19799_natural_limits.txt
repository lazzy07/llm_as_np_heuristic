**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison continued, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, knew he had to act quickly. He had the knife hidden in his pocket, and he was determined to protect himself and Ernest. 

With the bully unaware of Roy's intentions, Roy took a deep breath and lunged at the bully with the knife. In a swift motion, he managed to stab the bully, who fell to the ground, no longer a threat to either him or Ernest. 

Now that the bully was incapacitated, Roy could escape. He unlocked the gym door and made his way back to the hallway. He quickly crawled through the vents to the highway, where he put on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier. Disguised and free, Roy stepped onto the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
