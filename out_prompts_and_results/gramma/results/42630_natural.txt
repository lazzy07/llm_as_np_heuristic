To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to move closer to the merchant, potentially to confront her or to strategize.

2. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - The guard, being at the market, will inform the merchant about the bandit's presence, which is crucial for the merchant to avoid any criminal activity.

3. **The merchant walks from the camp to the market.**  
   - The merchant moves to the market to avoid the bandit and to sell more items or acquire more coins.

4. **The merchant buys the hero's coin from the hero.**  
   - The merchant uses the coin she has to buy the hero's coin, thus increasing her coin count without engaging in criminal activity.

5. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to move to a safer location away from the bandit.

6. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the camp.**  
   - The merchant returns to the camp, ensuring her safety and securing her coins.

By following this sequence, the merchant successfully increases her coin count while avoiding any criminal actions.
