To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, here’s how the story can unfold:

1. **Casey tells Blake that Alex wants jewelry (I3) in the living room (R21)**. This action is necessary because it can influence Blake's actions to help Alex, which indirectly helps Casey.
   - **Action**: `tell(C3, C2, I3, R21)`

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the living room (R21)**. This is necessary because Blake needs to have an item to trade with Alex.
   - **Action**: `pick_up(C2, I2, R21)`

3. **Blake moves to the dining room (R22)**. This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate a trade.
   - **Action**: `move(C2, R21, R22)`

4. **Blake trades the chocolates (I2) for the jewelry (I3) with Alex in the dining room (R22)**. This is the key action that allows Casey to eventually get the jewelry they want.
   - **Action**: `trade(C2, I2, C1, I3, R22)`

5. **Blake moves back to the living room (R21)**. This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey to give them the jewelry.
   - **Action**: `move(C2, R22, R21)`

6. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the living room (R21)**. This final action ensures that Casey receives the item they want, achieving their goal of happiness.
   - **Action**: `give(C2, I3, C3, R21)`

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purposes:

- **Tell**: Casey informs Blake about Alex's desire for jewelry, which can motivate Blake to help Alex.
- **Pick Up**: Blake collects chocolates to have something to trade.
- **Move**: Blake moves to the dining room to be with Alex for the trade.
- **Trade**: Blake trades chocolates for jewelry with Alex, which is crucial for Casey's happiness.
- **Move**: Blake returns to the living room to be with Casey.
- **Give**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
