After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Ernest is in the kitchen with the cigarettes he stole from the bully. Roy is aware that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened by him. To ensure their safety and to help Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he sees the bully and knows he has the knife. With a surge of determination, Roy confronts the bully and kills him with the knife. This act of revenge not only eliminates the threat but also secures their safety.
