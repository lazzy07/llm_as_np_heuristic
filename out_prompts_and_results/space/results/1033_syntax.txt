To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface, which is a key event in the story.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to be closer to the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.
3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard also walks to the cave, allowing both characters to be in the same location and facilitating their interaction.
4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship.
5. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts, which will result in the death of one character. Since Zoe is on the surface when the eruption occurs, she will die.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, one character dying, and both characters making friends.

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption process, which is crucial for the story's climax.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe closer to the Lizard, setting up the opportunity for friendship.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: Ensures the Lizard is also present in the cave, allowing for interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with their goals.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, resulting in Zoe's death.
