Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is in Patient Room A and exhibiting a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis, the disease associated with that symptom. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she believes she can still correctly identify Ross's condition. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A for Jarkis.** This action is necessary because Ross is showing a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. By treating him with steroids, the correct treatment, Ross will become healthy.

After this action, Ross is treated successfully, and Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young.** This action is necessary to check on Young, who is also in Admissions and has unknown symptoms. Since Young is not currently assigned to an exam room, Hathaway needs to assess him to determine if he requires treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. If he has Flaze, Hathaway can treat him with antibiotics, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
