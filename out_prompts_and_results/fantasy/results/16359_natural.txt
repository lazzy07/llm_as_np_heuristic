To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, and Vince has the money. However, Talia's happiness is currently at 0, and she has no wealth. 

The best course of action is for Talia to take the money from Vince, which will make her wealthy. Since Talia is married to Vince, she can take the money without any conflict. This action will directly contribute to her goal of becoming wealthy. 

After Talia takes the money, she will be wealthy, which will fulfill her desire for wealth. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Talia takes the money from Vince. (This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, which is one of her goals.)

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Talia takes the money from Vince**: This action allows Talia to achieve her goal of becoming wealthy, as she now possesses the money that Vince had.

After this action, Talia will have 1 wealth, and since she has achieved her goal of becoming wealthy, she will be happy as well.
