In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - jewelry). However, Casey (C2) and Blake (C3) are not happy because they do not have the items they want (C2 wants I2 - chocolates, and C3 wants I3 - flowers). 

To ensure Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can give Casey the item they want. Since Alex is already happy, they can focus on making Casey happy.

**Action:**
- give(C1, I3, C2, R21)

**Explanation:**
- Alex gives the flowers (I3) to Casey (C2) in the living room (R21). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they wanted (I3 - flowers). 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still happy with their jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C2) is now happy with the flowers (I3).
- Blake (C3) remains unhappy with the chocolates (I2), but since the goal was for Alex to make Casey happy, Alex has achieved their goal.
