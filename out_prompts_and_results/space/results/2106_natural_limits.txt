Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano begins to rumble ominously, signaling an impending eruption. Understanding the urgency of the situation, Zoe decides to take action to ensure both their safety. 

Zoe teleports to the spaceship, leaving the Lizard on the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location, but it makes the Lizard feel abandoned and unsafe, which is contrary to their goal of making friends. However, Zoe's intention is to return with help or a plan to ensure both their safety.

After teleporting, Zoe quickly assesses the situation from the spaceship and realizes she must return to the surface to help the Lizard. She teleports back down, but the Lizard, feeling neglected, is initially wary. 

Zoe then makes peace with the Lizard again, reaffirming their friendship and commitment to each other's safety. This action is crucial as it restores trust and cooperation between them, allowing them to work together to find a solution to the erupting volcano.

In the end, Zoe and the Lizard decide to walk together to the cave, where they can find shelter from the eruption. This action ensures both characters are safe and allows them to strengthen their friendship.
