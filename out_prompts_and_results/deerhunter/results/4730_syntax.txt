To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the forest, has a rifle, and has just shot Bambi. He is hungry and has a desire for money. The bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, and Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk has no money at the moment, but Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the rifle from the clerk. This action is included to ensure that Bubba has a loaded weapon to intimidate the clerk and take the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will return to the forest with the stolen rifle. This action is necessary to create a sense of urgency and to prepare for the next step.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba will decide to get money again, reinforcing his greed and desire for wealth. This action is included to ensure that Bubba is focused on his goal.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank once more to confront the clerk.

6. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will shoot the clerk to eliminate him and take the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Ensures Bubba has a weapon to intimidate the clerk.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Creates urgency and prepares for the next step.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's greed and focus on obtaining money.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Returns Bubba to the bank for the final confrontation.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the clerk and allows Bubba to take the money.
