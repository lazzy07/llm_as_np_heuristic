To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has a symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway can admit him to an exam room. This action is necessary to start the treatment process for Jones.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Similarly, Ross is also in the admissions room and has the same symptom (SymptomA). Admitting him to an exam room is essential for his treatment as well.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young, who is currently in Exam Room C. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure they receive the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, as Young has SymptomB (the rash associated with Jarkis). This treatment is crucial for Young to become healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in Exam Room A to confirm his symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After confirming Jones has SymptomA (fever associated with Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for his condition.

7. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to confirm his symptoms.

8. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After confirming Ross has SymptomA (fever associated with Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics as well.

By following this sequence of actions, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, as will Jones and Ross.
