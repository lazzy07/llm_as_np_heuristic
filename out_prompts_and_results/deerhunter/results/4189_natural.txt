To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will attempt to steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank to avoid any potential consequences.
4. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi**: Bubba, now in the forest, sees Bambi and decides to shoot her, which aligns with the goal of potentially having Bambi dead.
5. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi**: This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is taken because Bubba wants money and has the means to take it from the clerk.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.
- **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: This is a strategic move to escape after committing the theft.
- **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi**: Bubba's greed and hunger lead him to consider Bambi as a target.
- **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The final sequence of actions is as follows:

1. Bubba decides to steal.
2. Bubba steals the money from the clerk.
3. Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.
4. Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.
5. Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.
