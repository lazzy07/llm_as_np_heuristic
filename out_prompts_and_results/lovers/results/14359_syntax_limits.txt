In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Given the current situation, Alex is in the dining room (R22) and has not yet received the jewelry. Casey is in the living room (R12) and has the jewelry. Blake can help Alex by facilitating a trade between Casey and Alex.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that Blake will take:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Alex and facilitate the trade.

2. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey for the item Casey wants (I2). This action ensures that Alex will receive the jewelry.

After this trade, Alex will have the jewelry they want, making them happy. Since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, Blake achieves their goal through this action.
