To achieve the Merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks back to the Market, where she can continue her business and potentially sell more items or trade for coins. This action is necessary for the Merchant to remain in her preferred location and maximize her opportunities for profit.

This single action allows the Merchant to stay within the bounds of legality while still pursuing her goal of acquiring coins.
