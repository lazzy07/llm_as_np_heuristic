In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit currently has Tom's coin, which is a step towards achieving her goal. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Market to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coin in her chest. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to secure her coin in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
