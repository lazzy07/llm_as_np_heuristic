To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships with Rory and Vince, who have both proposed to her. Since Talia's happiness is tied to her relationships, we can have her accept one of the proposals and then marry that character. This will make her happy, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her goals.
2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

After these actions, Talia will be happy, achieving her goal.

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **accept**: This action is crucial as it allows Talia to move from a state of uncertainty regarding her relationship with Rory to a committed one, which directly increases her happiness.
- **marry**: This action finalizes the relationship, ensuring that Talia's happiness is secured through the bond of marriage.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)",
    "marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Talia becoming happy, fulfilling her primary goal in the story.
