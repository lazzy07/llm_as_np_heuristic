To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has the rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the power to take action against Bambi. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi, which will result in Bambi being dead. This action also aligns with Bubba's goal of having money, as he may want to take Bambi's meat for food.
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her, satisfying his hunger and ensuring that Bambi is dead.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money (by potentially selling or using Bambi's meat) and that Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action is taken because Bubba is hungry, and it sets the stage for him to take further actions related to food.
- **Bubba shoots Bambi:** This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bambi's death, fulfilling one of the conditions for the story's ending.
- **Bubba eats Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger and also reinforces the outcome of Bambi being dead.
