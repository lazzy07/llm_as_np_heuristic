To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he is happy. The main goal now is to acquire the treasure from the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to acquire the treasure, which will increase his wealth.
2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, thus increasing his wealth.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goal of being wealthy and happy, as he is already married to Talia.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Rory to reach the location where the treasure is located. Without traveling to the cave, he cannot access the treasure.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, which directly contributes to his goal of becoming wealthy.
