The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant dead and realizes that the guard is now a threat. She decides to take action to secure her goal of obtaining coins. 

1. The bandit attacks the guard, killing him. This action is necessary because the guard poses a significant threat to the bandit, and eliminating him allows her to operate freely without fear of being reported or attacked.

2. The bandit loots the guard's corpse, taking his sword and any coins he may have had. This action is essential for the bandit to increase her wealth and ensure she has more weapons for future encounters.

With the guard dead and the bandit now armed with two swords, she can safely return to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins and feel secure in her criminal activities.
