To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want directly from Casey.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey (C2) will have the chocolates (I3) and will not be happy, but since Alex's happiness is the goal, this trade is sufficient.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want by trading the chocolates they have with Casey, thus achieving Alex's goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
