To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently vulnerable since he is unarmed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the bandit camp where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

The sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit robs Tom, taking the coin he had. This is the first step to achieving her goal of accumulating coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from the chest at her camp, ensuring she has coins stored safely.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in her possession.
