**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, who is at the bandit camp, decides to walk to the crossroads. This action is necessary for the merchant to move closer to the market where she can sell her items and potentially earn more coins.

2. Upon reaching the crossroads, the merchant sees the guard and the hero at the market. The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial because it helps the merchant avoid any potential conflict with the bandit and allows the guard to take action against the criminal.

3. The guard, now aware of the bandit's location, walks to the bandit camp to confront the bandit. This action ensures that the bandit is dealt with, allowing the merchant to operate freely in the market without the threat of robbery or violence.
