To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe walks to the Cave**: This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, as they are currently in different locations.
2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, which aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends with other creatures.
3. **The volcano erupts**: This action will lead to the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe moves to the Cave to be with the Lizard.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard become friends, achieving their goal of friendship.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the death of both characters since they are on the surface.

This sequence ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting and both characters dying, while also achieving the goal of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
