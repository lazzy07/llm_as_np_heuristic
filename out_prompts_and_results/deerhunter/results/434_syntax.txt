To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and potentially acquire the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the bank with the stolen money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi, killing her. This action fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, achieving both goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling the greed aspect.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba needs to return to the forest after acquiring the money to ensure he is not caught.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
