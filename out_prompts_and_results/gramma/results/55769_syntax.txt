To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the coin from Tom, who is currently unarmed and unable to defend himself. This action allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring that she has the maximum amount of coins possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal efficiently.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: By taking the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, the Bandit ensures that she has a secure stash of coins, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
