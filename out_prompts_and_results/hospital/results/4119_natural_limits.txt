Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room C. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat them. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - **Reason:** Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones and Young, who are both in Admissions, to determine their symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - **Reason:** This action allows Hathaway to identify Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. Since Jones is in Admissions, Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - **Reason:** Similar to Jones, assessing Young will help Hathaway identify his symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze (assuming Jones has Flaze).**  
   - **Reason:** If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, treating him with antibiotics will ensure he becomes healthy. This action reduces Hathaway's workload by one.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis (assuming Young has Jarkis).**  
   - **Reason:** If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, treating him with steroids will ensure he becomes healthy as well. This action also reduces Hathaway's workload by one.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
