Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A first. Since Young is already assigned to this room, Hathaway can assess their symptoms without increasing their workload. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: After identifying the disease, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for achieving the goal of making Young healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Jones to Patient Room B, preparing to assess and treat Jones next. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones can also receive care, although it does not directly contribute to the immediate goal of making Young healthy.

After these actions, Young is now healthy, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

- **Assess Young**: Identifies the disease (Flaze) to provide the correct treatment.
