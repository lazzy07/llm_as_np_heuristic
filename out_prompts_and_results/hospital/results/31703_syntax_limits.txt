To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway has already assessed Young and knows they have SymptomA, the next logical step is to assess Ross, who is in PatientRoomB. This will allow Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis, which will make him healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Ross's condition. By assessing Ross, Hathaway can identify whether he has Jarkis (rash) or Flaze (fever). This is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Assuming Ross has been assessed and diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This action is essential for ensuring Ross becomes healthy, thus achieving Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully treats Ross, contributing to the overall health of all patients in the hospital.
