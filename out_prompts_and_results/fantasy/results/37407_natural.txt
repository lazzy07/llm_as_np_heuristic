To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the village to interact with Vince, who has the money. This is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

2. **Rory proposes to Vince.**  
   - Since Rory is already married to Talia, he can propose to Vince to create a bond that will help him achieve happiness through companionship.

3. **Vince accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - Vince accepts the proposal, which makes both Rory and Vince happy. This is crucial for Rory to achieve his goal of happiness.

4. **Rory and Vince get married.**  
   - The marriage solidifies their bond, contributing to Rory's happiness.

5. **Vince gives Rory the money.**  
   - To achieve wealth, Rory needs to obtain the money from Vince, who has it.

6. **Rory's wealth increases.**  
   - With the money from Vince, Rory now has wealth, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy.

7. **Rory's hunger remains at 0.**  
   - Since there are no actions that cause Rory to become hungry, he remains not hungry.

At the end of these actions, Rory is happy (due to his marriage with Vince), wealthy (having received the money), and not hungry (as he has not taken any actions that would cause hunger).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling** allows Rory to reach Vince, which is necessary for the next steps.
- **Proposing and accepting** creates a relationship that leads to happiness.
- **Getting married** solidifies that relationship, ensuring both characters are happy.
- **Transferring money** is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.
