**Story Completion:**

After taking the Ark from the Nazis, Indiana Jones realizes the danger it poses. He knows that the U.S. Army is looking for the Ark to ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands. To protect the Ark and ensure it is safely in the hands of the U.S. Army, Indiana decides to travel back to the United States with the Ark.

1. **Indiana Jones travels from Tanis to the USA.** (This action is necessary for Indiana to bring the Ark to the U.S. Army, as they are currently in the USA.)
2. **Indiana Jones gives the Ark to the U.S. Army.** (This action is crucial for achieving the goal of the U.S. Army having the Ark.)
3. **The Nazis remain dead.** (This is a consequence of their previous actions and does not require an action to maintain the story's integrity.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of traveling from Tanis to the USA is essential because Indiana needs to physically move the Ark to where the U.S. Army is located.
- The second action of giving the Ark to the U.S. Army is the direct fulfillment of Indiana's goal to ensure the Ark is in safe hands, thus achieving the story's objective.
- The status of the Nazis being dead is a necessary condition that remains unchanged and confirms that they no longer pose a threat.
