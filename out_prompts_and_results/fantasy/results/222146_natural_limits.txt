In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to ensure she has money and treasure, as well as a supportive relationship. 

Here's the completed story:

1. Talia travels from the village to the cave. (This action is necessary for Talia to confront Vince and potentially negotiate for the money he has.)
2. Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body. (This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire the money to achieve her goal of wealth. Since Vince is dead, she can take the money without any conflict.)
3. Talia's happiness increases as she now has both the treasure and the money, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.

Explanation of actions:
- Talia's travel to the cave is essential to confront Vince and take the money he possesses.
- Taking the money from Vince's dead body is the only way for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth, as she cannot propose or accept any further proposals without the necessary resources.
