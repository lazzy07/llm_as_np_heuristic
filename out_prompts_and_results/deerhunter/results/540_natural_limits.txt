Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He looks at the bank clerk, who has the money he desires. Since Bubba has the rifle and ammunition, he loads the rifle to prepare for a confrontation. 

1. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to threaten the clerk and achieve his goal of obtaining money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry, and since he has successfully stolen the money, he can now focus on satisfying his hunger.)

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money he wanted, and Bambi remains alive in the forest, as she was not involved in this confrontation.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the rifle**: This is crucial for Bubba to assert dominance over the clerk and ensure compliance.
- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Deciding to eat**: This addresses Bubba's hunger after successfully acquiring the money.
