Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a rash, decides to treat him for Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she knows that Jones is in Patient Room A and has a rash. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** This action is necessary because Jones is showing symptoms of Jarkis (rash), and treating him with steroids will make him healthy. 

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Jones becomes healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated next, as he is currently in Admissions and needs care.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to assess him to decide on the appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** This action is necessary because, despite the unknown symptoms, Hathaway's workload is low enough that she can safely treat Ross without making a mistake. 

By treating Ross, he becomes healthy as well.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that both Jones and Ross are treated correctly, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
