To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This is necessary because Casey needs to have an item to trade with Alex.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room. This is necessary for Casey to be in a position to interact with Alex.

4. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room to meet Casey. This is necessary for Alex to be able to trade with Casey.

5. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the jewelry (I1) with Alex. This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want.

6. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to conclude the story with Alex in a comfortable space.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
