Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that to ensure her safety and to foster a friendship with the Lizard, she must act quickly. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goals of health and safety. This action is crucial as it solidifies their relationship and ensures they are no longer enemies, allowing for cooperation.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the imminent danger of the volcano. This action is necessary to protect both characters from the eruption.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Once in the cave, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety. This action is the final step in achieving her goal of being healthy and safe.

By making peace with the Lizard and moving to a safer location, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of health, safety, and friendship.
