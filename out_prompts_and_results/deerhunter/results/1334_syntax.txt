To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle loaded with ammunition, and he is hungry and greedy. Bambi is also in the forest, and the bank clerk is in the bank.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, being greedy and hungry, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger, and it also eliminates Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, but it also means Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba can go to the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba can steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action fulfills the condition of Bubba having the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba eliminates Bambi, which is necessary for the story to end with Bambi being dead.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba satisfies his hunger by eating Bambi, which is a logical action after killing her.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of having money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
