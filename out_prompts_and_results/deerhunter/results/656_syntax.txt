To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene and avoid any potential consequences.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, which indicates he is still hungry after his actions. This action is included to show that Bubba is fulfilling his basic needs after achieving his goal.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, which is a deer in the forest. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger and complete the story.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully steals the money and addresses his hunger, achieving his goals in the shortest manner possible.
