Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to be present with Young for assessment.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms, which are known to be a rash, indicating Jarkis.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B with steroids.** (This action is necessary as it matches the treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Young becomes healthy.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions.** (This action is to check on the remaining patients, ensuring all are accounted for and healthy.)

After these actions, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal.
