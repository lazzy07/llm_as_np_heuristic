To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is armed with a sword. Since Tom is not a criminal, the Bandit can successfully take the coins from him. This action helps the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired from Tom and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to commit a more violent crime, which could attract the Guard's attention.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This is necessary for the Bandit to secure her loot in a safe location, away from the market and the potential for confrontation with the Guard.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully completed her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
