To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential interactions with other characters.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room. This action is included to show Blake's involvement in the story, even though it does not directly affect Alex's happiness.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey also moves to the dining room. This action is included for the same reason as Blake's move, to show the dynamics between the characters.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters' actions do not affect Alex's happiness but help to create a more complete narrative.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the dining room to access the flowers.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: While not necessary for happiness, it allows for character interaction.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)** and **move(C3, R22, R21)**: These actions show the presence of Blake and Casey, contributing to the story's social dynamics.
