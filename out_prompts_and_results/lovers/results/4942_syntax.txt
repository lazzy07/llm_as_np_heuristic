To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure that Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is currently unhappy because they do not have the item they want. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Casey, who has the jewelry.
   - **Reason**: This action is necessary for Blake to interact with Casey and facilitate the trade.

2. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to meet Blake.
   - **Reason**: This action allows Casey to be in the same room as Blake, enabling them to trade items.

3. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I3) they have for the jewelry (I2) that Casey has.
   - **Reason**: This action allows Blake to obtain the jewelry, which is the item they want, thus making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the jewelry (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy as well, since they have received an item in exchange.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C2, R22, R12)",
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry, while also allowing Casey to be happy with the chocolates they received in the trade.
