To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and wants money, while the clerk has one unit of money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires without needing to negotiate or ask for it.

2. **Go**: After stealing the money, Bubba will go from the bank to the forest. This action is included to move Bubba away from the scene of the crime, ensuring he is not caught by the clerk.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to take action against the bank clerk.
2. He points his loaded rifle at the clerk and steals the money from him.
3. With the money in hand, Bubba quickly leaves the bank and heads into the forest to avoid any potential consequences.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while minimizing the risk of being caught.
