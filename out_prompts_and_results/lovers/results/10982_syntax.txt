To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex (C1) will trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Blake (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is the jewelry.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy if they wanted chocolates.
- Casey will still be unhappy unless they receive the item they want.

Since the goal is to ensure Alex is happy, this single trade action is sufficient to achieve that.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
```

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: This action allows Alex to exchange the chocolates they have for the jewelry they want. Since Alex's goal is to be happy, obtaining the jewelry directly fulfills that requirement. This is the only action needed to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
