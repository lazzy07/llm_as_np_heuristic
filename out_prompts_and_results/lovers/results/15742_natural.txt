To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake is currently in the living room where the flowers are located. By picking them up, Blake can then give them to Alex, helping Alex achieve their goal.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action allows Blake to transfer the flowers to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for the flowers and making Alex happy.

3. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex to achieve their goal, but it sets up the next actions for Casey to potentially achieve their own goal later.

4. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, which is what Casey wants, making Casey happy.

5. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal but allows Blake to potentially find the chocolates later.

6. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the chocolates, which is what Blake wants, making Blake happy.

7. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey.**  
   - This action allows Blake to fulfill Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, which is the goal of the story.
