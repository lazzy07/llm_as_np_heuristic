To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The current situation shows that Blake (C2) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Alex (C1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **Trade**: Blake (C2) can trade the chocolates (I2) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want directly from Alex.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the jewelry (I3), making them happy.
- Alex will have the chocolates (I2), which is not what they want, but they are not the focus of this story.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C1, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates they have for the jewelry that Alex has. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

  "plan": ["trade(C2, I2, C1, I3, R22)"]
}
```
