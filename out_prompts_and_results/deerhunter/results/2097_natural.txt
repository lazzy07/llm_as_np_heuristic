To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also alive in the forest, and Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This will also ensure that Bambi is dead.
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary to fulfill the decision made in the previous step. It will result in Bambi being dead.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba will want to eat her to satisfy his hunger.
4. **Bubba eats Bambi.** - This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and allows him to consume the animal he has killed.

At this point, Bambi is dead, and Bubba has satisfied his hunger. However, he still needs to get the money from the clerk. 

5. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
6. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk without any resistance.

Now, Bubba has both the money and has satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi.
