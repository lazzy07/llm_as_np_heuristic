To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA with Ross, the first action is to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze (indicated by a fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If he has Jarkis (indicated by a rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomB where Young is located and assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify Young's condition and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. Similar to Ross, if Young has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential for Young's recovery.

5. **Admit Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Jones to an exam room (either A, B, or C) to ensure he is assessed and treated as well. This is necessary to fulfill Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

6. **Assess Jones**: After admitting Jones, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify the correct treatment for Jones.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified. This ensures that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated appropriately and become healthy.
