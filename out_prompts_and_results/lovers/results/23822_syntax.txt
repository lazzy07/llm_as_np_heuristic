To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the bedroom (R12) after receiving the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way for Casey to return to a familiar space after receiving what they wanted.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is the item they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: While not necessary for happiness, it represents Casey's return to their original space after achieving their goal.
