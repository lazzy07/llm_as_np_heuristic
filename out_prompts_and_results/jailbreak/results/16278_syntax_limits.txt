**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Roy is still in the laundry room, unaware of the danger that Ernest is in. Meanwhile, Ernest, who has just stolen the pack of cigarettes from the bully, is now in the hallway. He knows that the bully will soon find out and threaten him. To protect himself and his friend, he decides to take action.

1. **Action: lock_gym(Ernest, Hall)** - Ernest locks the gym door from the hallway, preventing the bully from coming out and threatening him or Roy. This action is crucial as it buys Ernest time to think and plan his next move without the immediate threat of the bully.

2. **Action: next_day()** - The day ends, and the next day begins. This action signifies a transition in the story, allowing for new opportunities and strategies to unfold. 

At the start of day two, Ernest is still in the hallway, and the bully is trapped in the gym. With the bully unable to threaten them, both Ernest and Roy can now focus on their escape. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Locking the gym door is a defensive move that protects both Ernest and Roy from the bully's threats. It allows them to strategize without the immediate danger of violence.
- Transitioning to the next day opens up new possibilities for escape or revenge, as the characters can now act without the bully's influence.
