To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Jones again. Therefore, Hathaway should assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because we need to know if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway should assess Young in the admissions room. This is important to determine Young's symptoms and ensure that all patients are evaluated.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are healthy, achieving their goal.
