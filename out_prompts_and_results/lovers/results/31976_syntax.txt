To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R12)**: Blake (C2) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the item they want while also ensuring that Casey gets something in return, which aligns with their desire to make Blake happy.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: After the trade, Blake will give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
