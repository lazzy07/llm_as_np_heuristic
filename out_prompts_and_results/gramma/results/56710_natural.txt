The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, now stands at the market with the hero's coin and the merchant's sword. The guard, who is also at the market, is unaware of the bandit's criminal actions. The banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

To achieve this goal, the bandit will take the following actions:

1. **Walk from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to transport the hero's coin to the safety of the bandit camp, where it can be stored in the chest. 

2. **Put the hero's coin in the chest.** This action ensures that the bandit has successfully secured the coin, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The story is short and direct, focusing solely on the bandit's actions to achieve her goal without unnecessary complications.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking from the market to the bandit camp:** This is necessary for the bandit to move the coin away from the market, where the guard could potentially interfere.
- **Putting the hero's coin in the chest:** This secures the coin and fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.
