**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: Admissions**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis. Since Young is in the admissions room, this is the first step to understanding their condition.

2. **Admit Hathaway, Young, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: After assessing Young, Hathaway admits them to an exam room (PatientRoomA) for further examination and treatment. This action is necessary to ensure Young receives the appropriate care.

3. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment: steroids, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has Jarkis (the only other disease), Hathaway treats them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial for ensuring Young becomes healthy.

**Final Explanation:**
The actions taken ensure that Hathaway can assess and treat Young effectively. By first assessing Young, Hathaway can determine the correct treatment. Admitting Young to an exam room allows for proper treatment, and administering steroids ensures Young's recovery. This sequence of actions leads to Hathaway achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
