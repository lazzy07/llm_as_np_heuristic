The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her, she decides to take action. The bandit attacks the guard, successfully killing him. With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now loot the items from the guard's corpse, which includes the guard's sword and any coins he may have had. 

Now that the guard is dead, the bandit can safely take the medicine from the merchant's corpse, as the merchant is also dead. The bandit now has the medicine and can return to the bandit camp with her loot, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins and items as possible.
