To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her coins in the chest.

2. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Now, let's summarize the story with the actions taken:
