Tom, realizing he is unarmed and in a precarious situation at the market, quickly assesses his options. He sees the guard, who is armed and likely to be hostile towards him as a criminal. However, he also notices the bandit, who has just robbed him and is now distracted by her newfound weapons. 

To achieve his goal of getting to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take a bold action. He reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action serves two purposes: it distracts the guard from Tom and puts the bandit in danger, as the guard is likely to attack her. 

As the guard turns his attention to the bandit, Tom seizes the opportunity to grab the medicine from the dead merchant's body. With the medicine in hand, he quickly makes his way back to the crossroads and then to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard**: This action diverts the guard's attention away from Tom and puts the bandit at risk, allowing Tom to act without immediate threat.
2. **Tom loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse**: This is the key action that allows Tom to obtain the medicine he needs to fulfill his goal.
3. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads and then to the cottage**: This final movement is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine.
