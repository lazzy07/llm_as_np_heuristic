In the current situation, Blake (C1) is unhappy because they want the jewelry (I1), which is currently with Casey (C2). Casey is also unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), which is not present in the current room. Alex (C3) is happy because they have the flowers (I3). 

To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, the simplest action would be for Blake to trade their item (which is currently not specified but can be assumed to be the flowers) with Casey for the jewelry. This will make Blake happy, as they will then have the jewelry they want.

Hereâ€™s the action that Blake will take:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers (I3) they have with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it directly leads to Blake achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will still be unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), but Blake's goal is achieved.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness. It directly addresses Blake's desire for the jewelry, which is the item they want.
