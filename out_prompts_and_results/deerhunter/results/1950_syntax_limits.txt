To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is greedy and hungry, decides to shoot Bambi in the forest. This action allows Bubba to potentially eat Bambi later, satisfying his hunger, and it also results in Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions of the ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the kill.

In this scenario, Bubba does not directly acquire money from the bank clerk, but he achieves his goal of satisfying his hunger by killing and eating Bambi. The story is short and direct, with only two actions needed to reach the desired outcome.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is necessary to eliminate Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the ending. It also aligns with Bubba's greed, as he may want to consume Bambi.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi, ensuring he benefits from his actions.
