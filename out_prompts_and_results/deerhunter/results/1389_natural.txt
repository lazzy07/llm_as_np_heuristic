To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money while considering the current situation and the actions available. Hereâ€™s the shortest sequence of actions that will lead to that outcome:

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** (Bubba already wants to have money, so this action is necessary to fulfill his desire.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Deciding to get money** is a necessary action because it aligns with Bubba's goal and sets the stage for his next actions.
- **Shooting the clerk** is essential because it allows Bubba to eliminate the threat and take the money without opposition.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.
