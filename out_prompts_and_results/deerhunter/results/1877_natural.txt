To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, wanting the money, will decide to steal from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can successfully steal the money from the clerk.
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest to avoid any confrontation with the clerk.
4. **Bubba decides to eat**: Now that Bubba has the money, he can satisfy his hunger by deciding to eat.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending.
