Zoe, still aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. She decides to teleport to the surface to assess the situation and potentially find the Lizard. Upon teleporting, she finds the Lizard at the cave entrance, looking anxious about the impending eruption. 

Zoe approaches the Lizard and, instead of attacking or teleporting back, she extends a hand in friendship, expressing her desire to work together to ensure their mutual safety. The Lizard, surprised but intrigued by Zoe's gesture, agrees to make peace. They both recognize that they share the same goal of being healthy and safe, and that cooperation is essential in the face of the erupting volcano.

As they stand together, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava flows toward them. In a moment of panic, Zoe teleports back to the ship, leaving the Lizard behind. The Lizard, unable to escape in time, is caught in the eruption and perishes.

This story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, while also establishing a moment of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the tragic event.
