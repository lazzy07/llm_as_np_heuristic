To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Jones is in PatientRoomB, Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

6. **Treat Young in Admissions**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
