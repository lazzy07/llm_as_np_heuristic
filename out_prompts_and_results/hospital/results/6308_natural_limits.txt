Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway is unaware of whether he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment. 

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Fortunately, Ross actually has Flaze, and the treatment is successful, making him healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is still experiencing an unknown condition, but Hathaway can now focus on him without the risk of making a mistake due to workload.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Since Young is also experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway treats him with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Young actually has Jarkis, and the treatment is successful, making him healthy as well.

With both Ross and Young treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
