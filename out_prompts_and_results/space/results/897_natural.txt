To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can either become friends or that one of them dies due to the volcano erupting. Given the current situation, the best course of action is for Zoe and the Lizard to make peace, which will allow them to become friends, while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safe place away from the erupting surface. It also allows her to regroup and think about her next move.
  
2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is crucial as it creates a sense of urgency and danger, leading to the next actions. Since Zoe is now in the cave, she is safe from the eruption, but the Lizard, who is still on the surface, is not.

3. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe teleports back to the surface to help the Lizard, showing her willingness to befriend him and take risks for others.

4. **Zoe stuns the Lizard.** - This action is taken to prevent the Lizard from being harmed by the eruption, as Zoe needs to ensure that the Lizard is safe. Stun is a temporary action that allows Zoe to act without causing permanent harm.

5. **Zoe breaks free from being stunned.** - The Lizard, realizing that Zoe is trying to help, breaks free from the stun, allowing them to communicate.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action signifies that they have decided to become friends, aligning with both of their goals of wanting to be healthy and safe and to make friends.

7. **The volcano finishes erupting.** - This final event concludes the story, resulting in the Lizard being killed by the eruption, despite their newfound friendship.

The story ends with the Lizard dying due to the eruption, but Zoe's actions show her intent to befriend the Lizard, highlighting the themes of friendship and sacrifice.
