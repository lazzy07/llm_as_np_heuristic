To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the jewelry (I3). Since Casey is currently happy with the chocolates (I2), we can facilitate a trade between Casey and Alex, who wants the flowers (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they have for the flowers (I1) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to give away the item they currently have (which makes them happy) in exchange for an item that Alex wants, thus making Alex happy as well.

2. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Blake (C2). This action is included to ensure that Blake is happy with the flowers, which is also part of Alex's goal to make Blake happy.

3. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3). This action is included to ensure that Casey is happy with the chocolates, which is also part of Casey's goal to make Blake happy.

After these actions, the happiness status is as follows:
- Casey is happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake is happy because they have the chocolates (I2).

This sequence of actions ensures that all characters achieve their goals of happiness.
