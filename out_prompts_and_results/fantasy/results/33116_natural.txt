To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to keep the treasure without any competition for wealth. 

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money from Vince's body. This action is crucial as it allows Gargax to become wealthy, which is his goal.

3. **Gargax eats Talia**: Gargax will then eat Talia. This action is necessary because it removes Talia from the story, but since Talia has already achieved her goal of being wealthy (by picking up the treasure), her happiness is not affected by her death.

4. **Gargax becomes wealthy**: By taking the money and having the treasure, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy.

In this sequence, Talia achieves her goal of being wealthy through the treasure she picked up, and Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy by taking the money from Vince. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Vince",
    "Gargax takes the money from Vince's body",
    "Gargax eats Talia"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Vince**: This action eliminates a competitor for wealth and allows Gargax to focus on Talia.
- **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: This action is essential for Gargax to achieve his goal of wealth.
- **Gargax eats Talia**: This action, while it removes Talia from the story, does not affect her wealth status since she has already picked up the treasure. 

Thus, Talia's goal of being wealthy is achieved through her actions, and Gargax's goal of wealth is also fulfilled.
