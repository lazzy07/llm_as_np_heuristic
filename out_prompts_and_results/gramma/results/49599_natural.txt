To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero.** The bandit is armed and the hero is not, allowing the bandit to take the medicine from the hero. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to ensure that the hero does not have any items that could be used against her.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she has.

3. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action is necessary to fulfill the bandit's goal of having the medicine secured in her camp.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying the medicine and having it stored in her camp.
