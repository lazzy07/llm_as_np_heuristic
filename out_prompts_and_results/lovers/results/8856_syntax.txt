To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the room where Blake is located (R21). This is necessary because Casey needs to interact with Blake to facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This is important because Blake wants the chocolates, and by giving them away, Casey can help Blake achieve happiness.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the room where Alex is located (R22). This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve their goal.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the key action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making them happy.
