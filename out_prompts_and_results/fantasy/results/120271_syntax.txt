To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. The story will involve Talia and Vince getting married, which will increase Talia's happiness. Since Talia already has the treasure, she will also be wealthy after the marriage. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the Village to be with Vince, as they need to be in the same location to get married.
2. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married, which makes both of them happy. This action fulfills Talia's goal of happiness and also solidifies her wealth since she has the treasure.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary because Talia needs to be in the same location as Vince to marry him. It is a crucial step to achieve her goal of happiness through marriage.
  
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action directly leads to Talia's happiness and solidifies her wealth since she possesses the treasure. Marriage is a significant event that fulfills her emotional and financial aspirations.

With these two actions, Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy.
