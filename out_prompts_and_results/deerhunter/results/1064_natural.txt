To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, while the clerk has no money. Bambi is alive in the forest, and Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the clerk.

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential threat and has no money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can ensure he has no competition for the money.
   
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** This action directly results in the clerk being dead, which eliminates any chance of the clerk interfering with Bubba's plans.

3. **Bubba decides to eat.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba is still hungry. He can now eat the clerk, who is dead, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba eats the clerk.** This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and allows him to consume the body of the clerk, which is a necessary step for him to feel satisfied.

5. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** After eating, Bubba can move to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi.

6. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** Now that Bubba is in the forest, he can target Bambi, who is alive and a potential source of food.

7. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** This action results in Bambi being dead, fulfilling the condition of the story where either Bubba has the money or Bambi is dead.
