**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is still in the admissions room, decides to admit him to an exam room to assess his condition. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is already in Patient Room A.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A.** (Assuming Jones has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who has just been admitted to Patient Room C.)

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C.** (Assuming Ross has Jarkis, this action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young, who is in Patient Room B.)

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.)

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Young has Flaze, this action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.)

At the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are treated successfully, and Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
