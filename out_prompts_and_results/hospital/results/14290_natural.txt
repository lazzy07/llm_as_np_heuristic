**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assign Young to an exam room to assess and treat them. This increases the workload to 2, which is still manageable.*

2. **Young walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   *Explanation: Young needs to be in the assigned exam room for assessment and treatment.*

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates Jarkis.*

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C with steroids.**  
   *Explanation: Since Young has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), treating them with steroids will make Young healthy. This reduces the workload back to 1.*

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.**  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat Ross, who is currently in Patient Room B.*

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the information available.*

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with antibiotics.**  
   *Explanation: Since Dr. Hathaway does not know Ross's symptoms, they mistakenly treat him for Flaze. However, this is a necessary action to ensure all patients are treated, even if it may lead to a negative outcome.*

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones, who is still in Admissions.*

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to confirm Jones's symptoms, which are known to be a fever (symptom of Flaze).*

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Admissions with antibiotics.**  
    *Explanation: Since Jones has a fever, treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy.*

**Final Outcome:**  
- Young is treated successfully for Jarkis and is now healthy.  
- Jones is treated successfully for Flaze and is now healthy.  
- Ross's treatment is incorrect, but the story focuses on Hathaway's goal of ensuring patients are treated.
