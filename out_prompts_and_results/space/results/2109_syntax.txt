To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the story will focus on building a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard while avoiding any actions that could lead to danger or conflict. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they can work together for safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to further their friendship and explore the cave together.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to explore the cave together, which can lead to a safer environment.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is included to introduce a sense of urgency and danger, prompting the characters to seek safety.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action emphasizes the importance of their earlier decision to move to the cave.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also forming a friendship.
