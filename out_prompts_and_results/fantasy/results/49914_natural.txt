To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her marrying Rory, who also desires happiness and wealth, and then acquiring the treasure in the cave. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** (This action eliminates Vince, who has the money but does not contribute to Talia's happiness or wealth. By removing him, Talia can focus on her relationship with Rory and the treasure.)
2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** (With Vince out of the way, Talia can now take the treasure, which will contribute to her wealth.)
3. **Rory picks up the money.** (Rory takes the money that Vince had, which will help him achieve his goal of being wealthy.)
4. **Talia and Rory are happy.** (Since Talia is married to Rory, and they both have wealth now, they achieve happiness together.)

Now, Talia is happy because she is married to Rory, and she is wealthy because she has the treasure.
