Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is in Patient Room A, Dr. Hathaway can assess him without increasing her workload beyond the limit that could lead to a mistake.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** Assuming Young has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's potential illness, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated later, thus working towards the goal of having all patients healthy.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Young, ensuring he is healthy, and prepares to help Jones next.
