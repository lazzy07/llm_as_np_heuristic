Bubba, after shooting Bambi, realizes he is still hungry and wants to have money. He decides to go to the bank to get money from the clerk. Since the clerk believes that Bubba has no money and is unaware of the rifle's presence, Bubba can approach the clerk without fear of being shot.

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to reach the clerk to get money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money without resistance from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can now eat Bambi, which he has shot.)

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money while also addressing his hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Stealing the money**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his goal of having money.
- **Deciding to eat**: After obtaining the money, Bubba can satisfy his hunger by eating Bambi, which he has already shot.
