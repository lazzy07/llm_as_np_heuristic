To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the bank and the clerk has 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk directly.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money.
3. **Bubba picks up the money.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money that the clerk had.

Now, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Go from the bank to the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to be in a position to confront the clerk directly, which is necessary for the next action.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk as a threat and take the money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can do this.
- **Pick up the money:** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, which fulfills his goal of having 1 money.
