**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that Young is experiencing a fever, decides to treat Young for Flaze, the disease associated with fever. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently 1, there is no risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Young is showing symptoms of fever, which corresponds to the disease Flaze. By treating Young correctly, Dr. Hathaway can ensure that Young becomes healthy.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 0, and Young is now healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address the other two patients, Jones and Ross, who are still in the admissions room and have unknown conditions. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat him.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** This action is also necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

Now that both patients are assigned to exam rooms, Dr. Hathaway can assess them.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition. Since Jones's condition is unknown, Dr. Hathaway will need to assess him to find out what symptoms he is showing.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** This action is necessary for the same reason as above; Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Ross's condition.

Assuming that both patients show symptoms that can be treated (for example, if Jones has a rash indicating Jarkis and Ross has a rash indicating Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway can treat them accordingly.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** This action is necessary if Jones is found to have a rash, which corresponds to the disease Jarkis.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** This action is necessary if Ross is also found to have a rash, which corresponds to the disease Jarkis.

By treating both Jones and Ross correctly, Dr. Hathaway ensures that all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Treating Young for Flaze is essential to ensure he recovers from his fever.
- Admitting Jones and Ross to their respective exam rooms is necessary to allow for their assessment and treatment.
- Assessing both Jones and Ross is crucial to determine their conditions and provide the appropriate treatment.
- Treating both patients for Jarkis ensures that they recover from their conditions, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
