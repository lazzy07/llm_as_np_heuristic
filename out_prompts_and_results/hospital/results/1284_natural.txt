**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Young is experiencing a rash, this assessment is crucial for the next step.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B with steroids.**  
   - After assessing Young and identifying the rash, Dr. Hathaway administers the correct treatment for Jarkis, which is steroids. This action is necessary for Young to become healthy.

3. **Young becomes healthy.**  
   - As a result of receiving the correct treatment, Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The assessment of Young is essential to ensure that Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies the disease. If Dr. Hathaway had a workload of three or more, there would be a risk of misdiagnosis, but since the workload is only one, the assessment is accurate.
- The treatment with steroids is the correct response to Young's symptoms (the rash), ensuring that Young recovers and achieves their goal of being healthy.
