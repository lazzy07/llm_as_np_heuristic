To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba's goal being met without any unnecessary actions.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba is at the bank with the rifle.** (This is the current situation.)
2. **Bubba has 1 money.** (Bubba's goal is already achieved.)
3. **Bubba decides to leave the bank.** (This action is not necessary for achieving the goal but can be included to conclude the story.)

Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can end here, as Bubba is satisfied with his current state.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Bubba has 1 money:** This confirms that Bubba has achieved his goal.
- **Bubba decides to leave the bank:** This action is included to provide a sense of closure to the story, even though it does not affect the outcome.
