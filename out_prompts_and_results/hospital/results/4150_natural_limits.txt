Dr. Hathaway, at Admissions, sees that all three patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are alive but experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake if they assess too many patients. To ensure that all patients receive the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to prioritize assessing and treating one patient at a time.

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to reduce Hathaway's workload and to start the assessment process for Young, who is currently in Admissions. By admitting Young, Hathaway can focus on one patient at a time.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A.**  
   - This action allows Hathaway to reach Young in Exam Room A to assess their symptoms.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine what symptoms Young is experiencing. Since Young is alive, Hathaway can now identify if they have Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Exam Room A.**  
   - After assessing Young, Hathaway can provide the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This ensures that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, which contributes to the overall goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
