In the current situation, Casey wants to be happy and has a desire for the item I3 (which is chocolates). However, Casey is currently not happy because they do not possess the item they want. 

To achieve Casey's goal, the simplest action would be for Alex to give Casey the chocolates. Since Alex is currently holding the chocolates (I3), this action will directly fulfill Casey's desire.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(Alex, I3, Casey, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R22). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- at(C1) = R22; at(C2) = R22; at(C3) = R22; at(I1) = C3; at(I2) = R21; at(I3) = C1; happy(C1) = False; happy(C2) = False; happy(C3) = True; wants(C1) = I1; wants(C2) = I2; wants(C3) = I3; 

Casey is now happy because they have the chocolates they wanted.

### Explanation of the action:
- The action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for chocolates, which is the only item they want to achieve happiness. By giving the chocolates to Casey, Alex ensures that Casey's goal is met.
