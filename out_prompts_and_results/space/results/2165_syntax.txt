To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will initiate a peace-making action with the Lizard while they are both in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that Zoe is aware of the dangerous situation on the surface due to the volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will also walk from the cave to the surface. This action is important as it shows that the Lizard is willing to follow Zoe and stay together, reinforcing their newfound friendship.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will erupt, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now friends and have left the cave, they will be safe from the eruption. This action is included to demonstrate the danger of the environment and the importance of their previous actions in ensuring their safety.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
