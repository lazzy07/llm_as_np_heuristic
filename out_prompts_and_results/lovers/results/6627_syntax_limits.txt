In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that they desire. 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Casey achieve their goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire, which will make them happy.

3. **put_down(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I3) in the living room (R22). This action is not necessary for Casey's happiness but could be a strategic move to help Blake, as it allows Blake to potentially pick it up later.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be near Blake. This action is to ensure that Casey is close to Blake, who they want to be happy.

5. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R22). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire to make Blake happy, as Blake will now have the item they want.

After these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry, and Blake is also happy because they received the item they wanted.
