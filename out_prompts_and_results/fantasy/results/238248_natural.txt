To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and by doing so, Rory will be dead. This will allow Gargax to fulfill their desire for wealth by taking the treasure Rory has.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy.

3. **Gargax becomes wealthy**: By taking the treasure, Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy.

4. **Rory's happiness is 0**: Since Rory is dead, they cannot be happy anymore, but this does not affect Gargax's goal.

In this scenario, Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry cannot be achieved because they are eaten by Gargax. However, Gargax achieves their goal of wealth through this action.
