**Story Completion:**

Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action. She knows she needs to communicate with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** (Zoe wants to find the Lizard and make peace, and she believes that being on the surface will allow her to do that.)
   
2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard.** (Zoe wants to establish a connection and show that she means no harm.)

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (Zoe and the Lizard both want to be healthy and safe, and making peace is the best way to achieve that. This action also changes their relationship from enemies to friends.)

4. **The volcano erupts.** (As a consequence of the previous actions, the volcano erupts while Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface, leading to a critical moment.)

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** (In a moment of urgency, they both teleport to safety, avoiding the eruption.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Zoe walks to the surface to confront the Lizard and initiate a peaceful interaction, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and friendship.
- Making peace is crucial as it transforms their relationship, allowing them to work together rather than against each other.
- The eruption serves as a dramatic climax that tests their newfound friendship and cooperation.
- Teleporting to the spaceship at the end ensures both characters survive the eruption, fulfilling their desire to be healthy and safe.
