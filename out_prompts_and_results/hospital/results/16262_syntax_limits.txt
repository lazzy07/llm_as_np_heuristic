In this story, Young is currently in PatientRoomB, and Hathaway is in the same room with a workload of 3. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, Hathaway needs to assess Young's symptoms and then treat them accordingly. However, since Hathaway's workload is already at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosis. 

To minimize the risk of error and ensure Young's health, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is essential for Young to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that the correct treatment is administered.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them based on the identified symptoms. This is the final step to ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy.

Since the goal is to ensure Young is healthy, these two actions are sufficient to achieve that outcome.
