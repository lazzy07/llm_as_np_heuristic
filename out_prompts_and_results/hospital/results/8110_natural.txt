**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that she has a heavy workload and needs to assess the patients quickly, decides to first admit Ross to an exam room. She admits Ross to Patient Room A. This action increases her workload to 4, but she needs to ensure all patients are seen.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. She discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. She treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making Young healthy. This reduces her workload back to 3.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones. She finds that Jones also has a fever, indicating that Jones has Flaze as well. She treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully making Jones healthy. This reduces her workload to 2.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. She assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. She treats Ross with steroids, successfully making Ross healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
