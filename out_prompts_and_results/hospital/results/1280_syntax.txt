To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is in the admissions room and has a symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway can admit Jones to Exam Room A. This increases Hathaway's workload to 1.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Young is also in the admissions room and has a different symptom (SymptomB). Hathaway can admit Young to Exam Room B, increasing the workload to 2.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway can now assess Ross, who is already in Exam Room A. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify the symptom.

4. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Since Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway can treat Ross with antibiotics. This will make Ross healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload back to 1.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway can assess Young in Exam Room B. Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Hathaway can treat Young with steroids, which will make Young healthy and reduce Hathaway's workload back to 0.

At the end of these actions, both Ross and Young will be healthy, achieving their goals of being alive and healthy.
