To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in the Admissions room and has a workload of 2, they can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.
