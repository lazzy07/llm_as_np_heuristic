**Story Completion:**

After Roy successfully disguised himself with civilian clothes and crawled through the vents to the highway, he found himself outside the prison. He took a moment to catch his breath, feeling the weight of his situation lift as he realized he was free. 

Meanwhile, inside the prison, Ernest remained in the cell block, still threatened by the bully. He knew he had to find a way to escape as well, but for now, he focused on surviving the day without drawing the bully's ire.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**: Roy disguises himself with civilian clothes to avoid being recognized as a prisoner. This is crucial for his escape.
   
2. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway, which is the only way for him to escape the prison. This action is necessary for him to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

3. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Once on the highway, Roy successfully escapes from the prison. This is the final action that fulfills his goal of being alive and free.

Ernest remains in the prison, but since the story focuses on Roy achieving his goal, his actions are sufficient to conclude the narrative.
