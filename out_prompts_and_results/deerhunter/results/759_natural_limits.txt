Bubba, having just eaten Bambi, feels satisfied but still desires money. He knows the bank clerk has money and decides to go to the bank to take it. 

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to get the money he desires.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk using the rifle.** - Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully obtains the money he wanted.
