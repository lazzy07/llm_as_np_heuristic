**Story Completion:**

The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She sees the bandit, who is a criminal, and knows that the guard is also present. The merchant quickly approaches the guard and reports the location of the bandit. 

The guard, upon receiving the information, immediately moves to confront the bandit. The bandit, realizing she has been reported, attempts to defend herself but is ultimately overpowered by the guard. The guard kills the bandit, ensuring that the market is safer and that the merchant can continue her business without fear of criminal interference.

With the bandit gone, the merchant can now safely collect the coins from the bandit's chest without any risk of being labeled a criminal herself. She successfully achieves her goal of acquiring more coins.

2. **Guard attacks and kills the bandit:** This action eliminates the criminal threat, allowing the merchant to safely collect coins and achieve her goal.
