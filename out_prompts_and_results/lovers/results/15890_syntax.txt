To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to make a trade or help Alex in the next step.

3. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I1) with Casey for the chocolates (I2). This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to conclude the story in a logical manner.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which makes them happy.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: This action allows Casey to give Alex something, which can help in the next step.
- **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: This is the crucial action where Alex gets what they want (the jewelry) in exchange for something they received (the chocolates).
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action is to wrap up the story, showing Alex returning to the dining room after achieving their goal.
