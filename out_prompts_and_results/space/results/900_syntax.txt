To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe recognizes that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and that they both want to be healthy and safe. Instead of fighting, she decides to make peace with the Lizard, which will help them both achieve their goals of friendship and safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the surface to ensure that she is aware of the volcanic activity and can help the Lizard if needed.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard follows Zoe to the surface, as it also wants to ensure safety and observe the situation together.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now on the surface together, they can work together to find safety.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship, ensuring that they can support each other during the eruption.

This sequence of actions leads to the Lizard achieving its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
