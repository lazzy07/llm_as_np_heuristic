Zoe, aboard her spaceship, realizes that the Lizard is in danger on the surface due to the erupting volcano. Understanding that she wants to make friends with the Lizard, she decides to teleport back to the surface to help.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to reach the Lizard and offer assistance. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and help him.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes peace with him. This action is crucial as it establishes a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. By making peace, they can work together to ensure their safety.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to find a safe place to escape the eruption. This action signifies the danger they face, but it also highlights the importance of their newfound friendship in overcoming challenges.

By completing these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
