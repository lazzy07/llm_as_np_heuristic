To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will assess him next to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross also receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross and determining his symptoms, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment as well. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Young becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
