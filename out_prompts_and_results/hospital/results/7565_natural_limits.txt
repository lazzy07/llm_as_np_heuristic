**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, decides to admit Jones and Ross to the exam rooms. Since both patients are experiencing Fever, they need to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room A.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is evaluated and treated for his symptoms.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is evaluated and treated for his symptoms.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently unknown to Dr. Hathaway.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis with steroids.** (This action is necessary because Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates Jarkis. Treating with steroids will make Young healthy.)

After these actions, Young is treated correctly and becomes healthy, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Admitting Jones and Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to manage their conditions effectively, as both are experiencing Fever and need treatment for Flaze.
- Assessing Young is crucial because Dr. Hathaway needs to understand Young's condition to provide the correct treatment.
- Treating Young with steroids is the correct action based on the assessment, ensuring Young's health is restored.
