**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.

4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.  
   *Explanation: After treating Ross, Hathaway needs to check Young's symptoms to provide the appropriate treatment.*

7. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.  
   *Explanation: Assuming Jones has a fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This will make Jones healthy.*

**Final Explanation:**

The workload remains manageable, preventing any mistakes in diagnosis.
