To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to have an item to trade.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary to interact with them and facilitate a trade.

4. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **put_down(C1, I2, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to keep the room organized.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
