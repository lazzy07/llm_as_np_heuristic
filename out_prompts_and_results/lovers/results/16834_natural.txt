To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by having the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Alex moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Alex to leave the bathroom and enter the living room where Blake and Casey are, and where the jewelry is located.

2. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - Blake wants to be happy and is currently not happy. By picking up the jewelry, Blake is working towards their own happiness.

3. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - Since Casey wants the jewelry, this action helps both Blake and Casey achieve their goals. Blake becomes happy by giving away the jewelry, and Casey becomes happy by receiving it.

4. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - Casey needs to move to the dining room to get the chocolates, which are currently there.

5. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates.

6. **Casey moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Casey returns to the living room to interact with Alex.

7. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.**  
   - This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy by receiving the chocolates.

8. **Blake is now happy.**  
   - With the chocolates, Blake is now happy, fulfilling their goal.

9. **Alex moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Alex returns to the bathroom to be alone with the flowers.

10. **Alex puts down the flowers in the bathroom.**  
    - This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to show that Alex is content with the flowers.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.
