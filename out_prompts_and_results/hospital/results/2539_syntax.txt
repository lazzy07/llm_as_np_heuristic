To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to focus on getting Jones assessed and treated correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis if Hathaway assesses Jones. Therefore, we will first reduce Hathaway's workload by treating one of the other patients, which will allow for a more accurate assessment of Jones.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Ross, Admissions, ExamRoomA)**: Ross walks to Exam Room A where Hathaway is currently located. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to assess and treat Ross, which will reduce her workload.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), ExamRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), ExamRoomA)**: Depending on the symptoms assessed, Hathaway treats Ross. This action is crucial as it will either cure Ross or lead to his demise, but it will also reduce Hathaway's workload.

4. **walk(Young, Admissions, ExamRoomB)**: Young walks to Exam Room B to be assessed next. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to.

5. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), ExamRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as Ross's assessment.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), ExamRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the symptoms assessed. This will also reduce Hathaway's workload.

7. **walk(Jones, Admissions, ExamRoomC)**: Finally, Jones walks to Exam Room C. This is necessary for Jones to be assessed and treated.

8. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Now that Hathaway's workload is reduced, the assessment is more likely to be accurate.

9. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), ExamRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Jones based on the symptoms assessed. This is the final action that ensures Jones becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Jones is assessed and treated correctly, ensuring that he achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
