**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room B first, as he is currently the only patient in an exam room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, she may make a mistake, but she needs to assess Jones to proceed with treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze (due to her high workload), she administers antibiotics. If Jones actually has Flaze, he will become healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**
   - After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway needs to ensure that Ross is also seen. She admits him to an exam room to reduce her workload.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as a rash, she administers steroids, which will make Ross healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**
   - Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to an exam room to ensure he is also treated.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze, she administers antibiotics. If Young actually has Flaze, he will become healthy.

By the end of these actions, all patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to assess and treat the patients in a way that maximizes the chance of them becoming healthy.
