However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want the item I3 (flowers), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want the item I2 (chocolates). To ensure Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This will make Casey happy, as they will receive the item they want.

- Alex (C1) sees that Casey (C3) is unhappy and wants to help. They decide to trade their jewelry (I1) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. 
- After the trade, Alex gives Casey the flowers, making Casey happy. 

Now, Alex has achieved their goal of making Casey happy, even though they have given away their jewelry.
