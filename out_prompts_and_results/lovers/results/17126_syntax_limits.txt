In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the chocolates (I3). Blake (C2) has the jewelry (I1) but is not happy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are currently in the dining room (R21).

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Blake (C2) can trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the chocolates (I3) that Casey (C3) has. This will make Blake happy, and since Alex wants the jewelry (I1), they will also become happy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

- **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey in exchange for the chocolates (I3). After this trade, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates they wanted, and Alex is happy because they now have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is necessary because it allows both Blake and Alex to achieve their happiness simultaneously. Blake gets the item they want (chocolates), and Alex gets the item they want (jewelry).
