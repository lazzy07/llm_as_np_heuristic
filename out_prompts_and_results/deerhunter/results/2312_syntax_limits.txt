Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, decides to take action to fulfill his desires. He is currently at the bank, where he has already stolen a rifle from the bank clerk. Since he is hungry and has a loaded rifle, he decides to go to the forest where Bambi is located. 

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba moves to the forest to find Bambi, as he is hungry and wants to eat.

Once in the forest, Bubba spots Bambi. 

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot Bambi, fulfilling his hunger by killing the deer.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer, satisfying his hunger.
