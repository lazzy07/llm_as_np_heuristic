In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item that Casey has). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the item I3 (which is the chocolates) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake is happy because they helped Alex achieve happiness.

The final plan in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "give(C3, I3, C1, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

This story is concise and effectively demonstrates how Blake achieves their goal of happiness by ensuring Alex is happy.
