Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him yet. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to assess without making a mistake. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 3. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, even though it increases the risk of a mistake later.

Then, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C to assess Jones. Since Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot diagnose him either. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, this is a gamble, but it is the only treatment available. If Ross has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. 

This sequence of actions allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat the patients, ultimately achieving the goal of ensuring that at least one patient becomes healthy.
