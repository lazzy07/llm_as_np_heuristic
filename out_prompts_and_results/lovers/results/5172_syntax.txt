To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is in the same room as Casey (R21). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I3) they have with Casey for the jewelry (I2). This is a direct action that allows Blake to obtain the item they want.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake gives Casey the chocolates they have in exchange for the jewelry. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- at(C1) = R22; 
- at(C2) = R21; 
- at(C3) = R21; 
- at(I1) = C3; 
- at(I2) = C2; 
- at(I3) = ?; 
- happy(C1) = False; 
- happy(C2) = True; 
- happy(C3) = False; 
- wants(C1) = I1; 
- wants(C2) = I2; 
- wants(C3) = I3.

Blake is now happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
