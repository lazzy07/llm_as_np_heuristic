Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, decides to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room B. Since Ross is the only patient assigned to an exam room, Hathaway's workload remains manageable at 2. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment. 

2. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions and admits Young to Patient Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to exam rooms for assessment and treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room A. This is crucial to identify Young's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
