In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers to be happy. Since the flowers are already in the living room, Alex can simply pick them up.

**Action:**
1. Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (the flowers), which will make Alex happy. Since the flowers are already in the same room, this action is straightforward and fulfills Alex's goal.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is still not happy because they still want the jewelry.

However, the story only needs to focus on Alex achieving their goal.
