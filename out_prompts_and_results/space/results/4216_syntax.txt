To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the story will focus on the Lizard and Zoe working together to create a safe environment. The following actions will be taken:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard, sensing danger from the volcano, decides to begin an eruption to create a barrier of lava that will protect both itself and Zoe from potential threats on the surface. This action is necessary to ensure their safety.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard then causes the volcano to erupt, solidifying the barrier and ensuring that they are both safe from external dangers. This action reinforces the safety aspect of the Lizard's goal.

3. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: After the eruption, the Lizard and Zoe realize that they need to work together to survive. They make peace, solidifying their friendship. This action is crucial for the Lizard to achieve its goal of making friends.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the cave, where it can be safe from the eruption and continue to build its friendship with Zoe. This action helps the Lizard find a secure location.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe follows the Lizard to the cave, ensuring that they can continue their friendship in a safe environment. This action is necessary for Zoe to remain safe and to support the Lizard's goal.

By taking these actions, the Lizard successfully achieves its goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
