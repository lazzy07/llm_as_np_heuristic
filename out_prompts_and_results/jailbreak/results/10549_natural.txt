**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is in the gym, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to act quickly.

1. **Roy escapes from the prison.** Since he is already on the highway and wearing civilian clothes, he takes the opportunity to leave the prison grounds. This action is crucial for Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

Meanwhile, in the gym:

2. **Ernest does his chores.** Although he is threatened by the bully, he knows that completing his chores might buy him some time and lessen the bully's anger. This action is necessary for Ernest to stay alive and avoid immediate confrontation.

3. **The bully goes to the hallway.** After a while, the bully decides to leave the gym, looking for more trouble. This action is important as it removes the immediate threat to Ernest, allowing him to focus on his chores.

With the bully out of the gym, Ernest can breathe a little easier, but he still needs to find a way to escape.

4. **Ernest sneaks through the vents to the highway.** After finishing his chores, he remembers that he can use the vents to reach the highway. This action is essential for him to reunite with Roy and escape together.

5. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** Once he reaches the highway, he quickly puts on the civilian clothes that Roy had stolen earlier. This action is necessary for him to disguise himself and avoid being caught by the guards.

Finally, with both characters now on the highway and disguised:

6. **Both Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** They take advantage of their disguises and the cover of night to leave the prison grounds together. This final action ensures that both characters achieve their goal of being alive and free.
