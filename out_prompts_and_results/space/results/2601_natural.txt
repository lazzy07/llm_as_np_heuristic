3. **The Lizard agrees to make peace with Zoe.** - This action signifies that both characters have successfully established a friendship, aligning with their mutual goals of safety and health.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is inevitable given the story's setup. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to find a way to escape the eruption.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure their safety from the eruption. Since they are friends, they can cooperate to teleport together.

6. **The Lizard is killed by the eruption.** - This tragic ending occurs because the Lizard was unable to teleport in time, highlighting the danger of the situation and the consequences of the erupting volcano.
