In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. The quickest way for Gargax to achieve his goal is to eat Rory, who is currently in the cave, and then take the treasure that is located there. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary because Gargax needs to eliminate a potential threat and also gain a source of wealth (Rory's money) indirectly through the next action.

2. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Treasure)**: After eating Rory, Gargax travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Gargax to obtain the treasure, which fulfills his desire for wealth.

By performing these two actions, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger by consuming Rory, who is a living character in the cave. It also removes Rory from the story, preventing any further competition for wealth.
- **travel(Gargax, Cave, Treasure)**: This action allows Gargax to move to the location of the treasure, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of wealth.
