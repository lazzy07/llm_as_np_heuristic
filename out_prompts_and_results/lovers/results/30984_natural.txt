To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers from the bedroom.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey knows the flowers are in the bedroom and wants to help Alex by obtaining the item they want.

2. **Casey moves from the bedroom to the bathroom.**  
   - Casey needs to move to the bathroom to give the flowers to Alex, who is currently there.

3. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the bathroom.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers, which is what they want, thus making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is in the bathroom with the flowers and is happy.
- Blake is in the bathroom and is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is in the bathroom and is happy because they helped Alex.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
