To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle and is in the bank. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money.

2. **Go**: Bubba will go from the bank to the forest. This action is necessary to reach Bambi, who is in the forest.

3. **Shoot**: Bubba will shoot Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, driven by greed, uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steals the money. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having money.

2. **Go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and heads to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to confront Bambi.

3. **Shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi with the rifle. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second condition of the ending.

By executing these actions, we achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead, or both.
