To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.** - This action is necessary because Rory wants to be happy, and marrying Talia will fulfill that desire.
2. **Talia accepts the proposal.** - Talia's acceptance is crucial for both characters to achieve happiness through marriage.
3. **Rory and Talia get married.** - This solidifies their happiness as a couple.
4. **Rory picks up the money from Talia.** - Since Talia has no money, Rory can take the money from Talia after they are married, which will increase Rory's wealth.
5. **Rory becomes hungry.** - This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Rory not being hungry, as he will need to eat soon.
6. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action is the final step that allows Rory to achieve his goal of not being hungry, as Gargax will consume him.

The story concludes with Rory achieving his goal of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring Talia's money), while also addressing the hunger condition through Gargax's action.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "Rory and Talia get married",
    "Rory picks up the money from Talia",
    "Rory becomes hungry",
    "Gargax eats Rory"
  ]
}
```
