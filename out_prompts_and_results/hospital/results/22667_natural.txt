**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis, which is incorrect. However, she proceeds to treat him for Jarkis.

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway administers steroids to Jones, believing he has Jarkis. Since Jones does not have Jarkis, he dies. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address the other patients, Ross and Young, who are still in the admissions room.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing her workload to 3 again.

5. **Walk from Patient Room A to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Ross does not have Jarkis, he dies.

8. **Walk from Patient Room B to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young.

9. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

10. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. Since Young does not have Jarkis, he dies.
