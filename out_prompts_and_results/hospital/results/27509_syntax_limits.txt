**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis. This is necessary to understand the symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment: steroids, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has Jarkis (as the symptom is unknown), Hathaway treats them with steroids. If Young actually has Jarkis, this will make them healthy. If not, it will lead to Young's death, but since the goal is to ensure Hathaway's patients are healthy, this is a calculated risk.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: After treating Young, Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment next.

  ]
}

**Summary of Actions:**
- The first action is to assess Young to identify their symptoms.
- The second action is to treat Young with steroids, assuming they have Jarkis, which is a risk but necessary for Hathaway to try to ensure patient health.
