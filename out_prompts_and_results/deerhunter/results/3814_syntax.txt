To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is also greedy and wants money, he will need to go back to the bank to get money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and focus on his next goal of acquiring money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to steal the money from the clerk, as he needs to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba steals the money from the clerk. This action fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and focus on his next goal.
