To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to ensure he can safely return to the cottage without being pursued or attacked. Given the current situation, Tom is at the crossroads with the medicine, and the merchant and guard are at the market. The bandit is dead, so there is no immediate threat from her.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Tom achieving his goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk directly from the crossroads to the cottage, carrying the medicine. Since there are no threats at the crossroads and the bandit is dead, this action is safe and allows Tom to reach his goal.

This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because it allows Tom to move from his current location (the crossroads) to his desired location (the cottage) while carrying the medicine. Since there are no threats or obstacles, this action directly fulfills Tom's goal.
