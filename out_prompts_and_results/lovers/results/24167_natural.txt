To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness.

2. **Casey picks up jewelry.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Casey also has an item they want, which is the jewelry. This helps maintain the balance of happiness among the characters, even though it is not directly related to Alex's goal.

3. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to search for the chocolates, which they want. It helps to show that Blake is also pursuing their happiness.

4. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Casey to follow Blake, maintaining the connection between the characters and their goals.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is not happy yet, but they are actively seeking the chocolates.
- Casey is not happy yet, but they have the jewelry.

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness while also allowing the other characters to pursue their own happiness.
