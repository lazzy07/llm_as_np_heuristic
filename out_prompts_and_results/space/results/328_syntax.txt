To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the cave to ensure she is in a safe location away from the dangers of the surface, especially since the surface is currently dangerous.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety and health away from the dangerous surface.

This sequence of actions allows Zoe to achieve her goals of safety, health, and friendship with the Lizard without engaging in any fights or dangerous situations.
