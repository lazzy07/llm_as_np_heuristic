Zoe looks around at the dangerous surface, realizing that staying here is not safe for either her or the Lizard. She remembers that they are friends now and that they both want to be healthy and safe. To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can both be safe from the erupting volcano.

**Action Explanation:**
- **Zoe teleports to the ship from the surface.** This action is necessary because it allows both Zoe and the Lizard to escape the dangerous environment of the surface, ensuring their health and safety. Since they are friends, Zoe's action of teleporting does not anger the Lizard, and they can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.
