To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move away from the guard and the hero, who are both at the market, and to position herself closer to the crossroads where she can make further decisions.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can safely store her coins and avoid confrontation with the guard and hero.

3. **The bandit loots the coin from the chest at the bandit camp.**
