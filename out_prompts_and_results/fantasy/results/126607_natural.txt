To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, but she is not happy. To make Talia happy, we can have her propose to Rory, who is already her husband, and then have Rory accept the proposal. This will increase Talia's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Talia proposes to Rory.** - This action is necessary because it allows Talia to express her love and commitment to Rory, which is a step towards her happiness.
2. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.** - Rory accepting the proposal is crucial as it solidifies their bond and contributes to Talia's happiness.
3. **Talia and Rory get married.** - Although they are already married, this action reinforces their commitment and ensures Talia's happiness is recognized.

After these actions, Talia will be happy, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Talia proposes to Rory:** This action is essential for Talia to express her feelings and seek happiness through her relationship.
- **Rory accepts Talia's proposal:** Acceptance is necessary for Talia to feel validated in her relationship, which directly contributes to her happiness.
- **Talia and Rory get married:** This action, while redundant since they are already married, serves to emphasize their bond and Talia's happiness.
