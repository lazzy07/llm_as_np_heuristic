To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying a sword but has no coins. This action is possible because the Bandit is armed and Tom is not carrying any coins. The Bandit will take the MerchantSword from Tom.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her items.

3. **Take Bandit Coins from the Chest**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, MerchantSword, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom to take his sword. This is necessary for the Bandit to ensure she is armed and can defend herself or rob others in the future.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp. This is necessary for her to reach a safe location where she can store her items and coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by the end of these actions.
