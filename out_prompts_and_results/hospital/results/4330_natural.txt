**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that there are still patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Since Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway proceeds to assess Ross anyway. 

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross actually has an unknown condition. As a result, Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway then returns to Patient Room A to assess Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Hathaway assesses Jones and finds that he is experiencing symptoms of Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. Again, with a workload of 1, there is no risk of error. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment, and Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
