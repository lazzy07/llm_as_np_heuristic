To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants money and the clerk has it.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to be at the bank to steal the money.)
3. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (Now that the clerk is dead, Bubba can take the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and the clerk is the only one who has it.
- **Go from the forest to the bank:** Bubba must physically move to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.
- **Shoot the clerk with the rifle:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.
- **Pick up the money from the clerk:** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, fulfilling his goal.
