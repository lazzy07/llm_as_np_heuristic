To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army needs to travel to Tanis to confront the Nazis and retrieve the Ark. This action is necessary to bring the US Army into the same location as the Nazis.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: Once the US Army arrives in Tanis, they will take the Ark from the Nazis by force. This action is essential to ensure that the US Army gains possession of the Ark.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, Tanis)**: After taking the Ark, the US Army will open it. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army character who opened it. However, the goal is to ensure the Nazis are dead, and this action will lead to that outcome.

4. **status(Nazis) = Dead**: The opening of the Ark will kill the Nazis as well, fulfilling the requirement that they are dead.

The sequence of actions ensures that the US Army ends up with the Ark while the Nazis are eliminated. The US Army's belief about the Ark being dangerous is not relevant since they are willing to take the risk to eliminate the Nazis.
