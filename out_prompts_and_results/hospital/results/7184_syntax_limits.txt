**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to PatientRoomC, Hathaway, who is currently in PatientRoomA, assesses Ross in PatientRoomB. Since Hathaway's workload is at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway decides to proceed with the assessment.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomB. Given that Ross is showing symptoms of a rash, Hathaway mistakenly believes that Ross has Flaze instead of Jarkis due to the high workload. 

2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, thinking it will help with Flaze. However, since Ross actually has Jarkis, the treatment fails, and Ross dies.

3. **Walk Young to Admissions**: Young, who is in PatientRoomA, walks to the Admissions room to check on Jones. 

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway, now in the Admissions room, assesses Jones. Jones is showing symptoms of a fever, and Hathaway correctly identifies it as Flaze.

5. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze.
