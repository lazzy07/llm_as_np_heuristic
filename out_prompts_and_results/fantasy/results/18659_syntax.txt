To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory and the treasure in the cave. Since Talia is already married to Rory, their happiness is linked. Additionally, they can acquire the treasure in the cave, which will contribute to Talia's wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary because it allows them to gain wealth, which is one of Talia's goals.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with the treasure. This action is important as it allows them to take the treasure to a place where they can potentially use it or secure it.

3. **give(Rory, Talia, Treasure, Village)**: Rory gives the treasure to Talia. This action is crucial because it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, fulfilling one of her primary goals.

4. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry, which is a necessary action to set up the next event.

5. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to remove a character who does not contribute to Talia's goals and to create a scenario where Talia and Rory can focus on their wealth and happiness without interference.

6. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This action is included to ensure Talia is in a safe location after the events with Gargax.

7. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action is not necessary since they are already married, but it can be included to reinforce their bond and happiness.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, making her wealthy, and she is married to Rory, which makes her happy.
