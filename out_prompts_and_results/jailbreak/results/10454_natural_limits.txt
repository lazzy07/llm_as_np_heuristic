**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to secure his safety and get the pack of cigarettes. He quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he can access the gym. 

Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten him or Roy anymore. With the bully locked away, Ernest feels a surge of confidence. He then puts on the civilian clothes he found in the laundry room, disguising himself. 

Now disguised, Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once he reaches the highway, he escapes from the prison, finally achieving his goal of being alive and free.

1. **Lock the gym door**: This action is crucial as it prevents the bully from being able to threaten or harm Ernest and Roy, ensuring their safety.
2. **Crawl through the vents to the highway and escape**: This action allows Ernest to leave the prison, fulfilling his desire to be alive and free from the bully's threats.
