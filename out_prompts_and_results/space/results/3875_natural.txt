Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is taken to find a safer location away from the imminent danger of the volcano. The cave is a more secure place for both Zoe and the Lizard.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they stay together and can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they remain allies, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and secure.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have moved to the cave, ensuring they are safe from the eruption.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
