To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is already in Exam Room B with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Ross.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the confirmed symptoms. If Ross has Flaze (fever), he will be treated with antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis (rash), he will be treated with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Young**: Next, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

4. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Young will then walk to Exam Room C, where he will be ready for assessment.

5. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.
