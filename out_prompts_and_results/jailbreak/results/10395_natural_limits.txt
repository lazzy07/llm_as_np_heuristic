Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to secure his safety and get the pack of cigarettes. He quickly moves from the laundry room to the hallway, where he can access the gym. Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside.
