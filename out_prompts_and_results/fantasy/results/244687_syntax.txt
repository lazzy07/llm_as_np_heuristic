To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia is already engaged to Vince, and Rory has also accepted her proposal. However, since Talia's happiness is tied to her relationships, we need to ensure she marries Vince, which will make her happy. Additionally, Talia needs to acquire wealth, which can be achieved by obtaining the treasure in the cave.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure. This action is essential for her to become wealthy.
3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village with the treasure. This is necessary to finalize her relationship with Vince.
4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia marries Vince. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Travel to the Cave**: Talia needs to go to the cave to access the treasure.
- **Pick up the Treasure**: Acquiring the treasure is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.
- **Return to the Village**: Talia must return to the village to marry Vince.
