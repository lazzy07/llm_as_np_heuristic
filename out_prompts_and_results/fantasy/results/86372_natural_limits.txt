Talia, Rory, and Vince are at the village, and Gargax is at the cave. Talia wants to be happy and wealthy, while Vince has the money but does not care about being rich. To achieve her goal of happiness, Talia decides to take action.

**Action:** Talia proposes to Vince.

**Explanation:** By proposing to Vince, Talia is taking a step towards her happiness. Since Vince is already wealthy (having the money), accepting this proposal would lead to Talia's happiness, as she would be married to someone who has wealth, fulfilling her desire for both happiness and wealth.
