In this story, we want to ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we need to take actions that will allow Hathaway to assess and treat Jones effectively.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room C to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. This is necessary because we need to identify Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

By following these two actions, Jones will be assessed and treated correctly, ensuring he achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
