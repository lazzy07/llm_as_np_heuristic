To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves to the Crossroads, which is necessary for her to interact with Tom or the Merchant later.
2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit goes to the Camp to access the coins in the chest, which is part of her goal.
3. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves to the Crossroads to potentially interact with Tom or the Bandit.
4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom moves to the Market, where he believes he can find the Merchant and the Medicine.
5. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads, where he can monitor the situation and potentially confront the Bandit.
6. **rob(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the MerchantSword. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain an item while the Merchant loses her sword, making her vulnerable.
7. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Camp, fulfilling her goal of acquiring coins.
8. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves back to the Market, where she can continue her business without being a criminal.
9. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Market)**: The Guard returns to the Market, ensuring he is in a position to enforce the law.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully moved to the Market, where she can continue her trade and acquire coins without engaging in criminal activity.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit’s movements are strategic to ensure she can access the coins while also interacting with the Merchant.
- The Merchant’s movements allow her to avoid confrontation and continue her business.
- The Guard’s movements ensure he is present to maintain order and potentially confront the Bandit if necessary.
