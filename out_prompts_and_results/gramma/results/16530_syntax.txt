To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for her to move away from the area where the Guard is present, as she wants to avoid any potential conflict or suspicion.

2. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will also leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for Tom to eventually reach the Cottage with the medicine, but it also allows the Merchant to interact with him without the Guard's interference.

3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will follow Tom and the Merchant to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to maintain the tension in the story, as the Guard is still on the lookout for criminals.

4. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom. This action is necessary for the Merchant to increase her coin count without resorting to criminal activity.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Merchant will walk to the Cottage. This action is necessary for her to secure her coins in a safe location.

6. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will also walk to the Cottage. This action is necessary for him to deliver the medicine he is carrying.

7. **walk(Guard, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Guard will follow Tom and the Merchant to the Cottage. This action is necessary to maintain the narrative tension, as the Guard is still pursuing the bandit.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant will have successfully acquired a coin from Tom without engaging in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.
