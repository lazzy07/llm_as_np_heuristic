To ensure the guard achieves their goal of killing criminals, the following actions will take place:

1. The guard walks from the crossroads to the market. 
   - **Explanation**: The guard needs to be at the market to confront the merchant and ensure that no criminal activity occurs there.

2. The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant.
   - **Explanation**: By informing the merchant about the bandit's presence, the guard can ensure that the merchant is aware of the threat and can take precautions.

3. The guard walks back from the market to the crossroads.
   - **Explanation**: The guard needs to return to the crossroads to maintain a presence there and monitor any potential criminal activity.

4. The guard attacks and kills the bandit.
   - **Explanation**: The guard's primary goal is to eliminate criminals, and since the bandit is already dead, this action is not applicable. However, if the bandit were alive, this would be the final action to achieve the guard's goal.

Since the bandit is already dead, the guard's goal is effectively achieved by ensuring the market is safe and the bandit is no longer a threat.
