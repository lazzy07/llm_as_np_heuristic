**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the locked gym with the bully, he knows he must act quickly. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of the situation. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, continues to pace, waiting for the door to be unlocked. 

Roy takes a deep breath and lunges at the bully, using the knife to stab him. The bully, caught off guard, falls to the ground, lifeless. With the threat eliminated, Roy quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. 

Now, with the gym door still locked, Roy crawls through the vent to the hallway. Once in the hallway, he puts on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise. He then makes his way to the highway outside the prison, where he successfully escapes, finally free from the prison and the threats that loomed over him.
