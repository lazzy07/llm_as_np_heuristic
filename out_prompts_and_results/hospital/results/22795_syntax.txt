To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is important to identify Young's symptoms and provide the necessary treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment based on the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly, thus achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, TreatmentB, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures Ross becomes healthy.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Young to find out what symptoms he has. This is necessary to provide the right treatment.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, TreatmentC, Admissions)**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
