To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money. After this action, the clerk is dead, and Bubba can take the money without any threat.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then goes to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to reach Bambi, who is his next target.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Bubba ends up with the money from the bank and that Bambi is dead, achieving the desired outcome.
