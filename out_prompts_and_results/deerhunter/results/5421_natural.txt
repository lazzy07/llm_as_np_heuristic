To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. The story can conclude with Bubba satisfied with his current situation.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba is at the forest.** (This is where Bubba is currently located.)
2. **Bubba has 1 money.** (Bubba has already achieved his goal of having 1 money.)
3. **Bubba is hungry.** (This indicates Bubba's state but does not affect his goal of having money.)
4. **Bubba believes that he is alive.** (This is a necessary belief for Bubba to continue existing in the story.)
5. **Bubba believes that he has 1 money.** (This reinforces that Bubba has achieved his goal.)

Since Bubba already has the money he desires, he does not need to take any further actions. The story ends here, with Bubba satisfied.

### Explanation of Actions:
- No further actions are needed because Bubba has already achieved his goal of having 1 money.
- The state of being hungry does not affect his goal, so it is included to show his current condition but does not necessitate any action.
- The beliefs of Bubba are included to show his awareness of his situation, which is essential for character consistency.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
