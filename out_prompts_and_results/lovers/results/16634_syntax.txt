To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Currently, I2 is not in anyone's possession, and Casey wants I2. Since Casey is currently unhappy, we need to help them get what they want, which will also help Blake.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to check for the item they want (I2).
   - This action is necessary for Casey to access the dining room where I2 might be.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room.
   - This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake and Alex to share their happiness.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake.
   - This action allows Blake to receive the item they want, making Blake happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Casey moves to the dining room** to find the item they want.
- **Casey picks up the jewelry** to fulfill their desire.
- **Casey returns to the living room** to be with Blake and Alex.
- **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake**, ensuring Blake achieves their goal of happiness.

After these actions, all characters are happy, and Blake has achieved their goal.
