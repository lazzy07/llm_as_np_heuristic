To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently in the market and does not have a sword. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp, where she can store the coins in the chest.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is necessary for the bandit to acquire a coin without risking her own safety, as Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is essential for the bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her newly acquired coin.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in her possession.
