To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the bedroom (R22) where Alex and the jewelry are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the bedroom (R22). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom (R22) to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for further interactions if needed.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the bedroom (R22) to the dining room (R12). This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for the possibility of further interactions.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C2, R12, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "move(C3, R22, R12)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by providing them with the item they want.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it allows for potential future interactions.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Similar to Alex's move, this allows Blake to be present for any further developments in the story.
