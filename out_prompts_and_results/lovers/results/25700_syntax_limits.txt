In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that Blake has, as Blake is currently unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R11)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Alex (C1) for the chocolates (I2) that Blake (C2) has in the living room (R11). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (I3) while also ensuring that Blake receives an item they want (I2), thus making both characters happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake is now happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Alex remains happy with the flowers (I1).

This single trade action effectively resolves the desires of both Casey and Blake, achieving their goals.
