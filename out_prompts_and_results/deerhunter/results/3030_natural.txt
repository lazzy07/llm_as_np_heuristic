To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bubba already has 1 money, we can focus on confirming Bambi's death to meet the requirement of the story.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and wants to eat Bambi, who is now dead.)
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (This confirms Bambi is dead and satisfies Bubba's hunger.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to take action to satisfy that hunger.
- **Bubba eats Bambi:** This action confirms that Bambi is dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending. It also satisfies Bubba's hunger.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has 1 money, and Bambi is confirmed dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
