To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey has the jewelry, but Casey is not happy because they want the chocolates (I3). 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Blake tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I2)**: This action is necessary because it will prompt Casey to consider giving the jewelry to Blake, as Casey wants Blake to be happy.
   - Action: `tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)`

2. **Blake trades the chocolates (I3) for the jewelry (I2) with Casey**: This action allows Blake to obtain the jewelry, which is what they want, thus making them happy.
   - Action: `trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)`

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the jewelry (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy as well, since they have what they want.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is a strategic move by Blake to communicate their desire for the jewelry, which is essential for Casey to understand what Blake wants.
- The second action is a trade that directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, ensuring their happiness.
