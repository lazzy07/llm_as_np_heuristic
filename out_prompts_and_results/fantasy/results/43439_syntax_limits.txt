In this story, Rory is in the cave, and Talia is in the village. Rory wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, he needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave and ensure he is not hungry. 

1. **Action: travel(Rory, Cave, Village)** - Rory travels from the cave to the village to be with Talia, who has proposed to him. This action is necessary for Rory to engage with Talia and potentially marry her, which will contribute to his happiness.

2. **Action: marry(Rory, Talia, Village)** - Rory marries Talia in the village. This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness, as marrying Talia will make both of them happy. 

After these actions, Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy (by marrying Talia who has the potential to acquire wealth), and not hungry (as he is now with Talia who can provide for him).
