To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Rory to take the money Vince has without any competition. 

2. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body**: After Gargax eats Vince, Rory can take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve their goal of being wealthy.

3. **Rory picks up the treasure**: Rory will then pick up the treasure that is at the cave. This action further increases Rory's wealth.

4. **Rory proposes to Talia**: Rory will propose to Talia, which is a step towards achieving happiness through marriage.

5. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: Talia will accept Rory's proposal, leading to both characters being happy.
