To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22). This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey, where they can interact.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Alex engaged in the narrative.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12). This action allows Casey to be in the same room as Alex, which can lead to further interactions or resolutions in the story.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they wanted, making them happy.
