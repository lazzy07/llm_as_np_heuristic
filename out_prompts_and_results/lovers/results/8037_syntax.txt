To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is in the same room (R22) as Alex, Casey, and Blake. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has put down in the same room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want in exchange for an item they currently have.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making Alex happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what they want, but they are not the focus of this story.
- Blake will still be in the same situation, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, Blake's happiness is not a priority in this sequence.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to get the item they desire (jewelry) by giving away the chocolates they received from Casey. This directly leads to Alex achieving their goal of happiness.
