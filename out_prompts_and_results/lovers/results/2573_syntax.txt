To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) is already happy with the chocolates (I1), but both Alex (C1) and Blake (C2) are not happy. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I2). This is a necessary action to inform Alex about Blake's desire, which may influence Alex's next actions.
   
2. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I2), which is located there. This action is necessary for Alex to obtain the item that Blake wants.

3. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room. This is essential for Alex to have the item that Blake desires.

4. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R12) to give the jewelry to Blake. This action is necessary to bring the item to Blake.

5. **give(C1, I2, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This is the final action that ensures Blake receives the item they want, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be unhappy because they still want the chocolates (I1).
- Blake will be happy because they now have the jewelry (I2).
- Casey will remain happy with the chocolates (I1).

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness.
