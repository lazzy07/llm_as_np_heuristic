To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **Bandit walks from Camp to Crossroads**: The bandit needs to move to a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially rob them.

2. **Bandit walks from Crossroads to Market**: The bandit moves to the market where Tom, the merchant, and the guard are located. This is crucial as the bandit needs to find a target to rob.

3. **Bandit robs Tom**: The bandit, armed with a sword, will rob Tom, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom is carrying.

4. **Bandit takes the coin from Tom**: This action is the result of the robbery, where the bandit successfully adds Tom's coin to her collection.

5. **Bandit walks back to Camp**: After successfully robbing Tom, the bandit returns to her camp to secure her coins.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of carrying more coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to Crossroads and then to Market**: These movements are necessary for the bandit to reach the location where she can find Tom, who has a coin.
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the critical action that allows the bandit to gain a coin without any repercussions since Tom is unarmed.
- **Taking the coin**: This is the outcome of the robbery, ensuring the bandit increases her wealth.
- **Walking back to Camp**: This final action secures the bandit's coins in her camp, completing her goal.
