**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis (the rash symptom) instead of Flaze (the fever symptom). 

2. **Treat Ross for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now aware of the consequences of her mistake, walks back to the Admissions room to assess the remaining patients.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, where Jones is currently located.

5. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Jones for Jarkis**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which fails since Jones actually has Flaze, resulting in Jones dying.

7. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions. She realizes that Young is the only patient left and correctly identifies that Young has Flaze.

8. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young.
