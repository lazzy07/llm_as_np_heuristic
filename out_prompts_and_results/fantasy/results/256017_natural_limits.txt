In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to acquire wealth, which can be done by obtaining the money that Vince has. 

Here's the completed story:

1. Talia travels from the village to the cave. (This action is necessary for Talia to confront Gargax and potentially negotiate for the money.)
2. Talia proposes to Gargax. (This action is a strategic move to gain Gargax's favor and possibly convince him to give her the money.)
3. Gargax accepts Talia's proposal. (This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness through the acceptance of her proposal.)
4. Talia and Gargax get married. (This action solidifies Talia's happiness and allows her to negotiate for the money.)
5. Talia takes the money from Gargax. (This action fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.)

By marrying Gargax, Talia not only achieves happiness but also secures the money she desires, thus fulfilling both of her goals.
