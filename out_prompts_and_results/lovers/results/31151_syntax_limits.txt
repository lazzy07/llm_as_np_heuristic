In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy. Alex has the jewelry in their possession, but they are not happy because they want the flowers (I1). Blake is also not happy because they want the chocolates (I2). 

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Casey for the flowers (I1) that Casey has put down in the dining room (R22). This action allows Casey to receive the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be unhappy because they wanted the jewelry (I3).
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy because they have what they wanted.
- Blake will remain unhappy because they still want the chocolates (I2).

This single trade action is sufficient to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
