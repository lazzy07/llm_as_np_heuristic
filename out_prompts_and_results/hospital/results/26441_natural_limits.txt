Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Upon assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway observes the rash, which indicates that Ross has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Since Jones is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will need to assess Jones in the next step to determine the appropriate treatment.
