To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Decide to steal**: This action is crucial because it aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money. It sets the intention for the next action.
- **Steal the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can intimidate the clerk into compliance.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, achieving his goal.
