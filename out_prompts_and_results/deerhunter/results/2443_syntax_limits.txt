To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, House)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to go to the house to get more ammunition, which will help him in his greedy pursuit of money or to kill Bambi.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, House)**: After going to the house, Bubba can pick up the money, fulfilling his greed.
