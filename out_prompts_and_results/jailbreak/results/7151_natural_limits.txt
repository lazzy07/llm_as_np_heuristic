**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, feels a surge of hope. He knows that Ernest is still in the laundry room, threatened by the bully. Roy decides to take action to ensure both of their safety. 

Roy sneaks back through the vent into the prison, moving quickly to the hallway. He knows the bully is still in the gym, and he has a plan. He locks the gym door from the hallway, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten either of them anymore. 

With the bully locked away, Roy returns to the highway, feeling a sense of relief. He knows that he can now escape without the threat of the bully looming over them. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Lock the gym door**: This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from being able to threaten or harm either Roy or Ernest. By locking the door, Roy ensures that the bully is contained and cannot interfere with their plans.

2. **Escape to the highway**: After locking the gym door, Roy returns to the highway where he can safely escape the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
