To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then walk back to the Admissions Room and assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify Jones's condition and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This will ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat both patients effectively, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
