To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and walk to the surface where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, sensing Zoe's presence, walks back to the cave. This action is included to create a scenario where both characters are in the same location, allowing for a potential conflict or resolution.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is crucial as it sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to one of the characters dying.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of a character dying due to the eruption.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Before the eruption fully takes effect, Zoe and the Lizard make peace with each other. This action is essential to ensure that they transition from being enemies to friends, fulfilling their goal of making friends.

6. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard dies as a result of the eruption. This action is included to meet the requirement of a character dying due to the volcano's eruption.

In summary, the actions taken lead to the volcano erupting, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to make peace and become friends before the eruption occurs.
