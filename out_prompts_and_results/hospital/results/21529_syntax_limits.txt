In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat too many patients. Therefore, the best course of action is to focus on one patient at a time.

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment plan. 

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Assuming Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and it will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment plan.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that at least two patients are treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.
