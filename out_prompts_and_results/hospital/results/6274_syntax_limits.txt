**Story Completion:**

After admitting Ross to Exam Room B, Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess the other patients. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in the admissions room. Young shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes Young is healthy.
   
2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in the admissions room. Jones also shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes Jones is healthy.

3. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway returns to Exam Room B to assess Ross. Ross shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes Ross is healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: Since Hathaway believes Ross is healthy, they do not treat him, and Ross remains alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine if Young has any symptoms that require treatment. Since Young is healthy, it confirms that Hathaway's workload is manageable.

2. **Assess Jones**: Similar to Young, assessing Jones helps Hathaway confirm that Jones is also healthy, allowing Hathaway to focus on Ross.

3. **Assess Ross**: This is crucial as it directly relates to Ross's health. By assessing Ross, Hathaway can confirm that he is healthy and does not need treatment.

4. **Treat Ross**: Although Hathaway does not treat Ross because he is healthy, this action is implied as part of the process of ensuring Ross's health status is confirmed.
