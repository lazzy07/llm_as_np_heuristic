Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A, where Jones is experiencing Fever. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must treat Jones for Flaze, the disease associated with fever. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Jones is showing symptoms of Fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Jones becomes healthy. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Young's condition. Since Young is currently experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway needs to assess him to identify if he has Jarkis or Flaze.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** Assuming Young has a rash (which is a possibility since his symptoms are unknown), treating him with steroids will ensure he becomes healthy as well.

By performing these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Jones and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Treating Jones for Flaze:** This is the first and crucial step to ensure Jones becomes healthy, as he is experiencing Fever.
- **Assessing Young:** This is necessary to identify Young's condition, as he is currently experiencing Unknown symptoms.
- **Treating Young for Jarkis:** This action is based on the assumption that Young may have Jarkis, and treating him appropriately will ensure he becomes healthy.
