Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A with Jones, realizes that her workload is too high and that she needs to act quickly to ensure the health of her patients. She decides to treat Jones, who is showing symptoms of Fever, with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Jones is experiencing Fever, and treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy, which is Hathaway's goal.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases by one, allowing her to manage her remaining patients more effectively. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross and Young, who are still in Admissions and have unknown symptoms. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that Young is also assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

By treating Jones successfully and admitting the other patients, Dr. Hathaway is on her way to achieving her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

**Final Explanation:**
- The first action treats Jones, ensuring he becomes healthy.
- The next two actions admit Ross and Young to their respective exam rooms, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat them in the future.
- The story is kept short and focused on the necessary actions to achieve the goal of patient health.
