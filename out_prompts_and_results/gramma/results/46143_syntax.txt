To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob the merchant, taking the coin that Tom is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go back to the camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to gain a coin without engaging in a more dangerous confrontation with the guard or risking her own life.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move to a safe location where the bandit can store her coins without the threat of being attacked by the guard.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action secures the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, completing her objective.
