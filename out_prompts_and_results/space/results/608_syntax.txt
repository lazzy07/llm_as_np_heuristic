To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will result in one character dying. The goal is to have Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe realizes that the Lizard is not a threat and that they both want to be healthy and safe. She approaches the Lizard and suggests they work together to find a solution to the dangers of the volcano. This action is necessary to establish a friendship between them.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the story to have the volcano erupt, leading to a character's demise.

3. **kill(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: As the volcano erupts, the Lizard, in an attempt to save Zoe, pushes her out of the cave but is caught in the eruption himself. This action results in the Lizard dying, which is a necessary outcome of the story.

The final story sequence leads to Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends just before the eruption, fulfilling their mutual desire for safety and friendship, while also resulting in the Lizard's death due to the volcanic eruption.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **make_peace**: This action is essential to achieve the goal of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with both characters' desires.
- **erupt**: This action is necessary to fulfill the story's requirement of the volcano erupting.
- **kill**: This action results in the Lizard's death, which is a critical part of the story's conclusion.
