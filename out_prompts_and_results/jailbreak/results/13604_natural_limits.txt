**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he finds himself locked in with the bully and Ernest. The bully, furious about the stolen cigarettes, threatens both Roy and Ernest. However, Roy has a plan. He quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen, ready to confront the bully. 

With a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. In a desperate struggle, Roy manages to overpower the bully and kills him. With the threat eliminated, Roy turns to Ernest, who is visibly shaken but relieved. 

Now that the bully is gone, Roy and Ernest can escape together. Roy quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then unlocks the gym door, and they both make their way to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, they crawl through the vents to the highway outside the prison. With the disguise on, they successfully escape, leaving the prison behind.
