In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant has the opportunity to sell the medicine to Tom, who is at the Market and has just purchased a sword. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help the Merchant achieve her goal:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant walks to the Market to sell the medicine to Tom. This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be at the same location as Tom to conduct the sale.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant using one of the coins he has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without engaging in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- The second action is the transaction that fulfills the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins legally. By selling the medicine, she increases her wealth without breaking any laws.
