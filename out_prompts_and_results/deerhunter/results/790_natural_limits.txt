Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs to get money. He knows the clerk at the bank has money, but he also sees Bambi in the forest, and he considers that Bambi could be a source of food. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to be able to shoot either Bambi or the clerk if he decides to take their money.)
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba wants to eat, and since Bambi is a deer, he can eat her if she is dead. This action also eliminates a potential threat to Bubba's plans.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** (After shooting Bambi, Bubba can satisfy his hunger by eating her.)
4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Now that he has eaten, he can go to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.)

At the end of these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi and can now go to the bank to take the clerk's money.
