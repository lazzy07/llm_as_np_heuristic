**Story Completion:**

After stealing the pack of cigarettes from the bully, Roy finds himself in the gym with the bully, who is now aware of the theft. The bully, furious and threatening, looms over Roy. However, Roy has a plan. He discreetly pulls out the knife he also stole from the kitchen. 

In a moment of desperation, Roy decides to take revenge on the bully. He lunges forward and kills the bully with the knife. With the bully out of the way, Roy quickly checks the surroundings to ensure no guards are nearby. 

Feeling a rush of adrenaline, Roy then locks the gym door to prevent anyone from entering and alerting the guards. He knows he needs to escape before the situation escalates. 

With the gym secured, Roy takes off the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier and puts them on, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the hallway, avoiding any potential encounters with guards. 

Once in the hallway, he makes his way to the highway. With the disguise on, he confidently steps out onto the highway, successfully escaping from the prison.
