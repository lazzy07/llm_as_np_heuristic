To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will also assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that both patients are treated correctly.

3. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as a fever (indicating Flaze), he will treat Ross with antibiotics, which will make Ross healthy.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a rash (indicating Jarkis), he will treat Young with steroids, which will make Young healthy.

5. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomA**: After treating the other two patients, Hathaway will need to admit Jones to an exam room. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, he will walk to PatientRoomA.

6. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics or steroids, depending on his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
