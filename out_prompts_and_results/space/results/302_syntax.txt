To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to make friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action initiates the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface where the volcano is erupting. This action is necessary for Zoe to avoid the immediate danger of the eruption.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard also walks to the cave, following Zoe. This action is important as it brings both characters together in the cave, allowing for the potential to make peace.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can now make peace. This action signifies the resolution of their previous misunderstandings and establishes a friendship between them.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts. Since Zoe is in the cave and safe, she survives, but the eruption signifies the danger of the surface, which could lead to the Lizard's demise if he is still there.

In this sequence, the Lizard is left on the surface when the volcano erupts, leading to his death. Meanwhile, Zoe successfully avoids the eruption and makes a friend in the Lizard before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption, creating a life-threatening situation.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe to safety, allowing her to survive.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: Brings the Lizard to the cave, setting up for peace.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, resulting in the Lizard's death.
