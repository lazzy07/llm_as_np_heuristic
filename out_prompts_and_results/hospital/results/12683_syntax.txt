To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After being treated, Jones will walk to the Admissions room to check on the status of the other patients, ensuring he is aware of their conditions and can help if needed.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is essential for diagnosing Jones correctly and ensuring he receives the right treatment.

2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. This is the key action that will lead to Jones becoming healthy.

3. **Walk(Jones, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: After treatment, Jones walks to the Admissions room. This action allows him to check on the other patients and ensures he remains engaged in the hospital environment.

By following these steps, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
