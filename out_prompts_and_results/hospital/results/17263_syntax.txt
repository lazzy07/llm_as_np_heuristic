To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway will walk to the admissions room and assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross is also treated correctly.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms and treat him accordingly.
