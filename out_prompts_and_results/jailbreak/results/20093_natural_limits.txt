**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully, who is unaware of his presence. Roy quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen. With a swift motion, he lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, realizing too late what is happening, tries to fight back, but Roy is determined. In a desperate struggle, Roy manages to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he needs to get to Ernest and escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. Feeling a surge of adrenaline, he exits the gym and heads to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, Roy crawls through the vents again, this time making his way to the highway outside the prison. Once he reaches the highway, he takes a deep breath, knowing he is finally free.
