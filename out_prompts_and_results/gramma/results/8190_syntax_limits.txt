To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market and needs to move towards the Crossroads to access the path to the cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to progress towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom can now walk to the Cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine. This action completes Tom's journey to his desired location.

The story is as follows:

Tom, armed with a sword, walks from the Market to the Crossroads. Upon reaching the Crossroads, he continues on the path to the Cottage, where he successfully arrives carrying the medicine.
