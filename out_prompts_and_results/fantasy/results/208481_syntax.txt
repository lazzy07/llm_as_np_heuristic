To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as she has already accepted his proposal. The story will involve Talia marrying Vince, which will make her happy, and then they will acquire wealth together.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action makes Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

2. **take(Rory, Treasure, Vince, Cave)**: Vince takes the treasure from Rory. Since Rory has the treasure, this action allows Vince to gain wealth, which will also contribute to Talia's goal of being wealthy.

3. **take(Vince, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Vince takes the money he already has. This action further increases their wealth.

Now, Talia is happy because she is married to Vince, and they are wealthy because they have both the treasure and the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This is essential for Talia to achieve happiness, as she has accepted Vince's proposal.
