To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates. This action is necessary for Alex to have an item to trade or give away.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is necessary to interact with them and facilitate the exchange.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates to Casey. This action is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates, and by giving them away, Alex can negotiate for the flowers.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the flowers. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers. This action is necessary for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room to give the flowers to Alex. This is necessary for the final exchange.

8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action is necessary for Alex to achieve their goal of being happy.
