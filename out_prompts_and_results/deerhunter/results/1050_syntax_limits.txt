Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action. He knows that the bank clerk has money, and he wants it for himself. Since he has just shot Bambi, he picks up the deer to eat, satisfying his hunger. However, he also wants to ensure he can get the money from the bank clerk. 

To achieve his goal, Bubba goes back to the bank, where the clerk is still present. He decides to steal the money from the clerk, using the rifle he has loaded with ammunition to intimidate the clerk into compliance.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger by eating Bambi.
