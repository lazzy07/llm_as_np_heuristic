To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares Bubba to either threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi, depending on his next move.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed and achieving the goal of having the money.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome. Bubba becomes armed and then uses that armament to eliminate the clerk, allowing him to take the money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

In this story, Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining money by eliminating the bank clerk, while Bambi remains alive, as her fate is not directly impacted by Bubba's actions.
