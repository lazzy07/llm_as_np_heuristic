To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to ensure their safety and establish a friendship. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety, while the Lizard remains on the surface. After that, Zoe can return to the surface to continue building their friendship.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports to the spaceship to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary because the surface is dangerous, and Zoe wants to be safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports back to the surface to continue her efforts to befriend the Lizard. This action is necessary to re-establish contact with the Lizard.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, solidifying their friendship. This action is crucial as it fulfills Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Teleporting to the ship** ensures Zoe's safety from the erupting volcano.
- **Teleporting back to the surface** allows Zoe to continue her interaction with the Lizard.
- **Making peace** establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling both of their goals.
