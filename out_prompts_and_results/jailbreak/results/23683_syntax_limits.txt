**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, now disguised in civilian clothes, decides to make his escape. He knows that the highway is his only way out. He carefully crawls through the vents from the hallway to the highway, ensuring he remains undetected. Once he reaches the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes to blend in and successfully escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: This action allows Roy to escape the prison undetected. Since he is already in the hallway, crawling through the vents is a strategic move to avoid the bully and the guards.
2. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: By putting on the civilian clothes, Roy disguises himself, which is crucial for his escape. This action ensures that he can blend in with the outside world and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.
