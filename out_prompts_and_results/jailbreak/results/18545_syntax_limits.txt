**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened. To ensure his safety and to escape the prison, he decides to take a calculated risk. 

Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from coming after him and gives him a chance to escape without being threatened. 

With the gym door locked, Ernest quickly crawls through the vents to the highway. Once he reaches the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry, disguising himself. 

Finally, with the disguise on, Ernest escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
