**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway outside the prison. He knows that he needs to escape before the bully can threaten him or Ernest again. 

Meanwhile, Ernest is still in the laundry room, feeling threatened by the bully. He has the pack of cigarettes, which he knows the bully wants. However, he also knows that he needs to find a way to escape as well. 

Roy decides to take action. He knows that he canâ€™t help Ernest directly from the highway, but he can escape and leave the prison behind.
