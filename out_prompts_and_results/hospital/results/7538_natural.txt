To complete the story while ensuring that Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to confirm Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Fever, Dr. Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Flaze.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - This action is essential because it matches the treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to allow Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Jones, who is also experiencing Fever.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is required for Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones in Admissions.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary to confirm Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Fever, Dr. Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Flaze.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Admissions with antibiotics.**  
   - This action is essential because it matches the treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young, who is currently in Patient Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not be able to identify the disease correctly, but since Young is not showing any symptoms of Fever or Rash, it can be assumed that Young is healthy.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C with steroids.**  
   - This action is not necessary since Young is healthy, but it will not harm Young. However, it is a precautionary measure to ensure that Young remains healthy.

After these actions, all patients (Ross, Jones, and Young) will be healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
