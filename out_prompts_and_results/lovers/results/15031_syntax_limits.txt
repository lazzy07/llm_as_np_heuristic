In the current situation, Casey wants to be happy and has a desire for the jewelry (I3). However, Casey is currently not happy because they do not possess the item they want. Alex has the jewelry (I3) and wants the flowers (I1), while Blake wants the chocolates (I2) and is currently unhappy as well.

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they have with Casey for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be unhappy because they wanted the jewelry (I3).
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy because they have obtained the item they wanted.
- Blake will remain unhappy as they still do not have the chocolates (I2).

This single trade action is sufficient to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
