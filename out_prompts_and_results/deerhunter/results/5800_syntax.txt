To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Since Bubba is currently at the bank and the bank clerk is also there, he can take advantage of the situation. The following actions will help Bubba achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money, and the clerk has money that Bubba can take.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is already part of the story, but it reinforces Bubba's motivation for stealing the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to intimidate the clerk and takes the money, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: Bubba moves to a safe location to keep the stolen money.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, House)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
