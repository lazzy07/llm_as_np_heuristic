**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Flaze, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomB. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Young is already in the room assigned to them. Hathaway believes Young is alive and healthy, so they will assess Young to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action will make Young healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Flaze, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in PatientRoomC. Since Hathaway's workload is now reduced to 2 after treating Young, there is no risk of making a mistake. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. 

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy as well.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary to determine Young's condition and ensure Hathaway can provide the correct treatment. 
- The second action is crucial as it directly leads to Young's recovery, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy.
- The third action is to assess Ross after Young has been treated, ensuring Hathaway can correctly identify Ross's condition without the risk of error due to workload.
- The fourth action treats Ross correctly, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
