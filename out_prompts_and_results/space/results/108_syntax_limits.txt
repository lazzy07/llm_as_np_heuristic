Zoe, determined to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both their safety, decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is crucial because it allows her to approach the Lizard without teleporting, which would anger him. Once she reaches the cave, she initiates a conversation to make peace with the Lizard, expressing her desire for friendship and mutual safety. This action is essential as it directly addresses both characters' goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - Zoe walks to the cave to avoid angering the Lizard and to approach him directly.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, establishing a friendship and ensuring both of their safety.

By completing these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe.
