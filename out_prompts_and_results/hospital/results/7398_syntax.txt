To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Since Young is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will first assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure Young is in a room where they can be treated.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit them to Exam Room C. This is necessary for treatment.

5. **Treat Ross**: Since Ross is already in Exam Room A and has been assessed with SymptomA, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for SymptomA. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: After admitting Young to Exam Room B and assessing their symptoms, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, after admitting Jones to Exam Room C and assessing their symptoms, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
