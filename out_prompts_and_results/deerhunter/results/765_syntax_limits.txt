To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After acquiring the money, Bubba will go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome with minimal actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who has the money he desires. It is a critical step to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is implied as Bubba would need to move from the bank to the forest to find Bambi. However, since the action is not explicitly stated in the prompt, it can be assumed as part of the narrative flow.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, which is one of the conditions of the goal. It also satisfies Bubba's hunger.
