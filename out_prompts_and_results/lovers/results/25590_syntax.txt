To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake wants to have the item that Alex wants, which is I3 (chocolates). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I3) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because Blake needs to give Alex what they want (the chocolates) to make Alex happy, and in return, Blake will receive an item that they can use to achieve their own happiness.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey (C3) gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex (C1). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the chocolates, making Alex happy.

3. **give(C2, I1, C3, R22)**: Blake (C2) gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to ensure that Casey is also happy, as Casey wants the jewelry.

After these actions, the happiness status will be:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake (C2) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) is happy because they received the jewelry (I1) from Blake.

Thus, all characters achieve their happiness, but Blake's goal is specifically met.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C2, I3, C3, I1, R22)",
    "give(C3, I3, C1, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade**: This action allows Blake to give away the chocolates to Casey in exchange for the jewelry, which is a strategic move to ensure Alex gets what they want.
- **give**: This action is crucial for transferring the chocolates to Alex, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **give**: This action allows Blake to give the jewelry to Casey, ensuring that Casey is also happy, which aligns with Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy. 

This sequence of actions effectively leads to Blake achieving their goal while also considering the happiness of the other characters.
