To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to reach the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal, as he already possesses the medicine after robbing it from the merchant.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the cottage with the medicine. Since he is already at the Crossroads and the path to the Cottage is available, this action directly leads him to his goal.
