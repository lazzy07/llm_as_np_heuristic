To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the Merchant's sword after attacking her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to become armed, which is essential for her to defend herself and potentially rob or attack others in the future.

2. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot Tom's coin after attacking him. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Market to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored in the chest, further solidifying her goal of having coins.

The sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal efficiently by first arming herself, then acquiring coins from Tom, and finally securing her coins in the Bandit Camp.
