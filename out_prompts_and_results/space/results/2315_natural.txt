Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface. To achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe and healthy, Zoe needs to take the following actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and potentially form a friendship.

2. **Zoe finds the Lizard at the surface and makes peace.**  
   - Since Zoe and the Lizard are not fighting, this action allows them to establish a friendly relationship. Making peace aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be friends and ensures that they can communicate without conflict.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard discuss the dangers of the erupting surface.**  
   - This action is implied as part of their conversation after making peace. By discussing the dangers, they can work together to ensure their safety and health.

4. **Zoe teleports back to the spaceship with the Lizard.**  
   - This action ensures that both characters are safe from the erupting surface. By teleporting together, they can escape the danger and remain healthy.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard agree to explore the universe together.**  
   - This final action solidifies their friendship and sets the stage for future adventures, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

The sequence of actions leads to a successful outcome where both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety, health, and friendship.
