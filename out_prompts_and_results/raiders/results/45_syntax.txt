To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant while the Nazis are eliminated. The current situation shows that the Nazis are already dead after opening the Ark, which was dangerous. The US Army has the Ark, and Indiana Jones is alive. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the desired ending:

1. **travel(Jones, USA, USA)**: Indiana Jones remains in the USA, where he is already located. This action is redundant but emphasizes that he is still present and aware of the situation.
2. **give(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army, having the Ark, gives it to Indiana Jones. This action is included to show that the US Army acknowledges Jones's expertise and possibly his desire to protect the Ark.
3. **travel(Jones, USA, Tanis)**: Indiana Jones travels to Tanis to ensure the Ark is safe and to prevent any further attempts by the Nazis to reclaim it, even though they are dead.
4. **dig(Jones, Ark, Tanis)**: Indiana Jones digs up the Ark again in Tanis, ensuring that it is secure and confirming its location. This action is included to reinforce the idea that he is safeguarding the Ark.
5. **travel(Jones, Tanis, USA)**: Indiana Jones returns to the USA with the Ark, ensuring it is back in a secure location.
6. **open(Jones, Ark, USA)**: Indiana Jones opens the Ark, which is now safe since the Nazis are dead. This action is included to show that he has the power to control the Ark and to demonstrate his immortality.

After these actions, the US Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are confirmed dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.
