Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Young, who is currently in Patient Room A and exhibiting symptoms of Fever. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, she can safely treat Young without making a mistake.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze**: Since Young has a fever, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies the disease as Flaze and administers antibiotics. This treatment is successful, and Young becomes healthy.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B**: After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones, who is still in the admissions room, to Patient Room B. This action does not change Jones's location but prepares him for assessment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is in Patient Room C. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway will need to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, since the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, the focus remains on Young's successful treatment.

By treating Young, Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy, and she has set the stage for further actions with Jones and Ross.

### Explanation of Actions:
