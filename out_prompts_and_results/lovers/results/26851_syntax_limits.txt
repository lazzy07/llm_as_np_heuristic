In this story, Alex is currently happy because they have the item they want (I1). However, Casey and Blake are not happy because they do not have the items they want (I2 and I3, respectively). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the item Casey wants (I2) is located.

This action is necessary because it allows Alex to access the item that Casey desires, which is essential for making Casey happy. Since Alex is already happy, their goal of ensuring Casey's happiness can be achieved by simply retrieving the item Casey wants.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be in the dining room (R21) and can pick up the flowers (I2) to give to Casey.
- Casey will then be happy because they will have the item they want.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
