Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he aims at Bambi. Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. He then decides to eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger. With his hunger satisfied, Bubba now has the money he wanted, as he can take the money from the bank clerk later.
