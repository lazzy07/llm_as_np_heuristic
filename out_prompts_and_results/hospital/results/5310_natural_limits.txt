Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to an exam room. Since Young is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young in the newly assigned exam room.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Young has Jarkis, this action is necessary to administer steroids, which will make Young healthy.)

After these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
