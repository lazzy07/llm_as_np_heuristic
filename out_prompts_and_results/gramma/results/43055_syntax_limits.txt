In this story, the Merchant's goal is to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp with the Medicine and Tom is at the Crossroads with a sword. The Bandit is also at the Crossroads, and the Guard is at the Market.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Take the Medicine from the Merchant**: The Merchant can take the Medicine from her location at the Camp and move it to the Crossroads, where Tom is located. This action allows her to sell the Medicine to Tom for a coin, thus achieving her goal of acquiring more coins without engaging in criminal activity.

Here’s the complete action:

- **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads to sell the Medicine to Tom.

This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to be in the same location as Tom, who is willing to buy the Medicine. 

After this action, the Merchant can sell the Medicine to Tom for a coin, thus achieving her goal of acquiring more coins without becoming a criminal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for the Merchant to achieve her goal while adhering to the constraints of the story.
