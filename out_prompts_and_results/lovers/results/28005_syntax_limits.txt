In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I3). 

Given the current situation, Blake is in the dining room (R22) with Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). Blake has the chocolates (I2) and knows that Alex wants the flowers (I3). 

To help Alex achieve happiness, Blake can give Alex the flowers. However, since Blake does not have the flowers, they need to first move to the living room where Alex is, and then give Alex the flowers.
