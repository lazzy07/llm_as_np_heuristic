To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently in the room (R22) with them. However, Casey (C3) has put down I1 in R22, and Alex needs to pick it up.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) that Casey has put down in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because Alex wants I1 to be happy.

After this action, Alex will have the jewelry, which means Alex will be happy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
