To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1, which is jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially trade or receive the item they want.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the item they have (I2, which is chocolates) to Alex. This is a strategic move because it allows Alex to have an item, and it also keeps the interaction going between the characters.

3. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Blake for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This is crucial because it directly leads to Alex obtaining the item they want.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the room (R21) where they were initially. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way for Alex to regroup after the trade.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey and Blake to interact with them.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives chocolates to Alex, which is a step towards Alex's happiness.
- **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: This is the key action where Alex gets the jewelry they want by trading the chocolates.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: While not necessary for happiness, it shows Alex's movement back to their original space.
