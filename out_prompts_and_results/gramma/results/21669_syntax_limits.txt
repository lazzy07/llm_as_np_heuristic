To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and knows that the medicine is with the Merchant at the Market. He needs to go to the Market to retrieve the medicine.

2. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is at the Market with the medicine. She will walk to the Crossroads to meet Tom.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads after meeting the Merchant.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being at the Cottage.

However, since the goal is to keep the story as short as possible, we can combine the necessary actions into one:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom can directly walk to the Cottage, as he has already robbed the Merchant of a coin, which allows him to buy the medicine from her when he reaches the Market.

In this case, the only action needed is for Tom to walk directly to the Cottage after ensuring he has the medicine.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary because it allows Tom to reach his desired location (the Cottage) while carrying the medicine he needs. Since he has already robbed the Merchant, he can buy the medicine when he reaches the Market.
