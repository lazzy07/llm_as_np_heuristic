In the current situation, Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want item I2, which is currently unknown to them. However, they know that Alex (C1) wants item I1, which is with Casey (C3). Since Casey is already happy with item I3, Blake can help Alex by facilitating a trade that will make Alex happy.

To achieve this, Blake can tell Alex that they want item I2, which is a lie, but it will prompt Alex to think about their own desires. Then, Blake can move to the living room to find out more about item I2.

Hereâ€™s the action sequence:

1. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that they want item I2, which is a lie. This action is necessary to create a sense of urgency for Alex to act on their own desires.
2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bathroom to check for item I2. This action is necessary to explore the possibility of finding the item that Blake wants.

However, since the goal is to make Blake happy, they need to find a way to get item I2. Since the story requires a specific ending where Blake achieves their goal, we can assume that Blake will eventually find item I2 in the bathroom, making them happy.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R12)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **tell(C2, C1, I2, R22)**: This action is included to manipulate the situation so that Alex feels compelled to act, even though it is a lie. It sets the stage for further actions.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to explore the bathroom for item I2, which is crucial for achieving their happiness. 

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Blake's happiness while also considering the dynamics of the other characters.
