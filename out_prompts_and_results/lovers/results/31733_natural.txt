1. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the bathroom.** (Blake is currently in the bathroom and needs to pick up the jewelry to trade it later.)
2. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Blake needs to go to the living room to find Casey and trade items.)
3. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry.** (Blake lies to Casey to manipulate the situation, making Casey believe that Alex wants the jewelry.)
