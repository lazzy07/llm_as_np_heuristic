In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy, and they are currently not happy. Alex has the jewelry, but they are not happy either because they want the flowers (I1). Blake is also not happy because they want the chocolates (I2). 

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to trade with Alex. Since Alex has the jewelry that Casey wants, and Casey can offer the flowers that Alex desires, this trade will make both characters happy.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R21)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- Casey (C3) will be happy because they now have the jewelry (I3).
- Alex (C1) will also be happy because they now have the flowers (I1).

Blake remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R21)"]
}
