1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to give or trade items.

2. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to be with Casey. This is important for Alex to communicate and potentially trade items.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to have an item to trade.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is a crucial step as it allows Alex to have an item, which may help in achieving happiness.

5. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary for Alex to be in a position to trade or give items.

6. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room to be with Alex. This is important for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve happiness.

7. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake for the jewelry (I1). This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
