To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she makes peace with the Lizard. This action signifies that they are no longer fighting and are willing to become friends, which aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement for the volcano to erupt, leading to a character's demise.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, being on the surface when the volcano erupts, dies as a result of the eruption. This action is necessary to ensure that a character dies, fulfilling the story's requirements.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
