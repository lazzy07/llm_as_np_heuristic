To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit needs to leave the Market, where she currently is, to reach the Crossroads. This is necessary to move towards the next location where she can access the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After reaching the Crossroads, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This is essential for her to access the chest where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from her possession and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.
