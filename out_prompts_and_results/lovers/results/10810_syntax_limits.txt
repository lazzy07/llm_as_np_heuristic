To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to trade the flowers they are holding for the jewelry that Casey has. This will make Alex happy because they will have the item they want.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will not be happy, but Alex's happiness is the priority.
