To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard, as she believes that being on the same location will help her establish a connection.
   
2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation.

3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship and ensuring both characters feel safe.

4. **Erupt (Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is in the cave with the Lizard, they are safe from the eruption. This event adds urgency to their need for friendship and cooperation.

5. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship, ensuring both characters feel secure and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of them remain safe and healthy.
