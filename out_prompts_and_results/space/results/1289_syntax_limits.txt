Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she looks at the Lizard, who is also on the surface. They have just made peace, but the danger of the environment looms over them. Zoe knows that to ensure both of their safety and to foster friendship, they need to leave the dangerous surface.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave with the Lizard. This action is necessary to move to a safer location where they can continue to build their friendship without the immediate threat of the dangerous surface.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it shows the Lizard's willingness to join Zoe in a safer environment, reinforcing their budding friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it ensures that both characters achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

By moving to the cave, Zoe and the Lizard escape the dangers of the surface and strengthen their bond, achieving their goals of health, safety, and friendship.
