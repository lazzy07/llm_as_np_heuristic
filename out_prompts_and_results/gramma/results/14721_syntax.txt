To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently carrying a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The bandit, seeing Tom in the market, decides to rob him. She successfully takes the coin he was carrying.
- With the coin now in her possession, the bandit walks to the bandit camp, where she can either keep the coin for herself or store it in the chest.

At this point, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying coins.
