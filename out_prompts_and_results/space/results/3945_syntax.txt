To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures a cooperative atmosphere.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface, especially since the surface is currently dangerous. This action helps the Lizard to be safe.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are in a safe location together.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface will begin to erupt. This action is included to create a sense of urgency and danger, emphasizing the need for the characters to be in a safe location.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action highlights the importance of their previous decisions to move to the cave.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
