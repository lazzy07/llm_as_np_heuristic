To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coins he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently vulnerable since he is unarmed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has the coins she desires in her possession.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without risking her own safety, given that Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in her possession.
