**Story Completion:**

Ernest, after completing his chores in the kitchen, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, and he has the pack of cigarettes that the bully wants. To ensure his safety and to keep the cigarettes, he moves to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, Ernest takes a moment to think about his next move. He knows that he needs to secure his position and avoid any confrontation with the bully. He decides to crawl through the vents to the gym, where he can lock the bully inside. 

After crawling through the vents, Ernest finds himself in the gym. He quickly locks the gym door behind him, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. With the bully trapped, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He now has the opportunity to escape the prison without any threats looming over him.
