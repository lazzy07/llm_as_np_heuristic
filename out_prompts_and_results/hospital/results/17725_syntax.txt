To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that Jones, who is currently in the admissions room, is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Similar to Jones, Ross needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, which is still manageable but will require careful assessment to avoid mistakes.

3. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Flaze.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment for Flaze, which is antibiotics. This will make Jones healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify that he has Flaze.

6. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics, making him healthy as well.

7. **Treat Young with Steroids in Exam Room A**: Since Young has SymptomB, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, making him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
