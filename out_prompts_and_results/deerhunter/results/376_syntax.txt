To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since Bubba is greedy and wants money, he will need to go to the bank to steal from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and focus on his next goal, which is to get money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will load his rifle with ammunition. This action is crucial because it prepares him to threaten the bank clerk, ensuring he can steal the money without resistance.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the loaded rifle. This action achieves Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to threaten the clerk, ensuring he can steal the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
