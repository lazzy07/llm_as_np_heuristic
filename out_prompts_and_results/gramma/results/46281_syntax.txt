To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of his coin. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently carrying a coin. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully rob him.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in her possession, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without any risk of retaliation since Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move to a safe location where the Bandit can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in her possession.
