**Final Plan in JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "The hero walks from the crossroads to the market.",
    "The hero sees the bandit at the market.",
    "The hero picks up a sword from the ground.",
    "The hero attacks the bandit with the sword.",
    "The hero loots the bandit's corpse for the coins.",
    "The hero walks from the market to the crossroads.",
    "The hero walks from the crossroads to the cottage."
