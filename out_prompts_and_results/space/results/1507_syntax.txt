To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can interact in a way that leads to either the volcano erupting, a character dying, or both, while also allowing for the possibility of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action will initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to create a sense of urgency and danger, which can lead to a dramatic conclusion.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the volcano begins to erupt, Zoe and the Lizard can realize the imminent danger they are in. This action allows them to set aside their differences and become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and be safe.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action will finalize the eruption of the volcano, leading to the death of one of the characters. Since Zoe is currently in the cave with the Lizard, she will be safe, but the eruption will still occur.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: This action will result in the Lizard dying due to the eruption, as it is on the surface when the volcano erupts.

The sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard making peace before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation that prompts the characters to act quickly.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard realize they need to work together to survive the eruption, leading them to become friends.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface.
4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, being on the surface, is killed by the eruption.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcomes of the story.
