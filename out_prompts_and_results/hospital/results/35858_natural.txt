**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds. She mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload and treats him with steroids. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. She correctly identifies that Young has Flaze, as he is experiencing a fever. She treats Young with antibiotics, and he becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross. She correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze as well and treats him with antibiotics, making him healthy too.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and Ross, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
