To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to eat Bambi, who is already dead. By doing this, Bubba satisfies his hunger and confirms that Bambi is indeed dead, which aligns with his belief that Bambi is not alive.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi:** This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger. Although it does not directly give him money, it confirms that Bambi is dead, which is a condition that can be considered as fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Bubba decides to eat Bambi"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible action that leads to the conclusion of the story while adhering to the constraints provided.
