To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will initiate a peace-making action with the Lizard while they are both in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows them to stop any potential conflict and start building a friendship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk back to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters can be in a safe location together, as the cave is not a long-term safe place due to the volcano's threat.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe to the surface. This action reinforces their new friendship and ensures that they are both in the same safe location.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe will again make peace with the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that they both feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
