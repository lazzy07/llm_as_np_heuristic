To ensure the guard achieves their goal of killing criminals, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. The guard reports the location of the bandit to the merchant. This action is necessary because the guard needs to gather information about the bandit's whereabouts to effectively pursue and eliminate the criminal.

2. The guard walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. This action is essential as it allows the guard to confront the bandit directly, as the bandit is likely to be at the camp.

3. The guard attacks and kills the bandit. This action fulfills the guard's goal of killing a criminal, as the bandit is indeed a criminal.

The story is concise and directly leads to the guard achieving their goal without unnecessary actions or complications.
