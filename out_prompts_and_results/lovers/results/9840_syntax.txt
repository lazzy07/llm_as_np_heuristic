To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the living room (R22) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) has it in their possession. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I1) they have for the chocolates (I2) that Alex (C1) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want while giving Casey something they want in return.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey (C3) will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy.

Blake (C2) remains in the dining room (R12) and is not directly involved in this action, but since Alex is now happy, the goal is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex gets the jewelry they want, thus achieving their happiness.
