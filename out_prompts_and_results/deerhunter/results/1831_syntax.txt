To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he is hungry. The bank clerk is at the bank, and Bubba believes the clerk has money. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where the money is, and the second action enables him to take the money directly from the clerk.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential as it allows Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just shot Bambi, to the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling his greedy desire for money.
