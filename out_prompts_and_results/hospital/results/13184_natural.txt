**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Ross is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To reduce the workload and ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment, Hathaway first assesses Ross again to confirm the symptoms.

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to confirm that Ross is indeed experiencing a fever and to avoid a potential mistake due to the high workload.)
   
   - After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway confirms that Ross has a fever.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.** (This action is necessary to treat Ross for Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.)

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address the patients in Admissions, Jones and Young, who are both experiencing unknown symptoms. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room for assessment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with steroids.** (This action is necessary to treat Jones for Jarkis, assuming the rash is present.)

Finally, Dr. Hathaway needs to admit and assess Young.

6. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment.)

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.)

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C with steroids.** (This action is necessary to treat Young for Jarkis, assuming the rash is present.)

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring they are all healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to either assess or treat the patients based on their symptoms, ensuring that Dr. Hathaway does not make a mistake due to the high workload.
- The sequence of admitting, assessing, and treating is crucial to ensure that all patients receive the correct treatment for their respective diseases.
