To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry, and he needs to eat to regain energy. This action is necessary for his survival and well-being.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle and is greedy, he will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action directly helps him achieve his goal of obtaining money.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for him to achieve his goal of having money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba needs to eat to satisfy his hunger.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to eliminate the clerk, allowing him to take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money after shooting the clerk, fulfilling his goal of obtaining money.
