Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. However, the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous as the volcano begins to erupt. Both Zoe and the Lizard want to be healthy and safe, and they realize that they need to work together to survive.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action has already been taken, indicating that the volcano is starting to erupt, creating a sense of urgency for both characters.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - Zoe decides to walk to the cave, hoping to find shelter from the impending eruption. This action is necessary for her to seek safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)** - The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, recognizing that they both need to escape the danger of the eruption. This action reinforces their growing friendship as they work together for safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts while both characters are in the cave, which is a critical moment in the story. Since they are in the cave, they are safe from the eruption, but the eruption signifies the danger of the surface.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Although they have already made peace, this action can be interpreted as solidifying their friendship in the face of danger. They realize that they can rely on each other for safety and companionship.
