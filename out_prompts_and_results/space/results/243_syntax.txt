To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are not currently fighting, this action can succeed.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further their friendship and explore the Lizard's home.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will again attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger of the surface and the importance of their location.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard.
