Tom stands at the Crossroads, holding the medicine he looted from the Merchant. The Bandit, who has just attacked the Merchant, is still present and armed. Tom knows he needs to get to the Cottage with the medicine, but the Bandit poses a threat. 

To ensure his safety and achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the Bandit to the Guard. This action will alert the Guard to the Bandit's presence, allowing the Guard to take action against her. 

1. **report(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)**: Tom reports the Bandit to the Guard, ensuring that the Guard is aware of the criminal's presence. This action is crucial as it helps Tom avoid confrontation with the Bandit and allows the Guard to deal with her.

After Tom reports the Bandit, the Guard, who is already at the Crossroads, can now take action against the Bandit.

2. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard attacks the Bandit, eliminating the threat she poses. This action is necessary for Tom to safely proceed to the Cottage with the medicine.

With the Bandit defeated, Tom can now safely walk to the Cottage.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks to the Cottage, successfully carrying the medicine. This action fulfills Tom's goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.

In summary, the actions taken by Tom and the Guard ensure that Tom can safely reach his destination without the threat of the Bandit.
