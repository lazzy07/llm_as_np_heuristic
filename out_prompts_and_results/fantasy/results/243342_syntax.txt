To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted a proposal from Vince, which makes her happy, but she also needs to acquire wealth. Since Vince has money, Talia can take it from him. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels back to the cave where Vince is located. This is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as Vince to take the money from him.

2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial as it allows Talia to become wealthy, fulfilling her goal of wealth.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action ensures that Talia is happy, as she has accepted Vince's proposal earlier.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (due to her marriage to Vince) and wealthy (after taking the money from him).

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Travel**: Talia needs to be in the same location as Vince to interact with him and take the money.
- **Take**: This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.
- **Marry**: This action fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through her relationship with Vince.
