In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but they are both unhappy and have no wealth. Vince, who is at the village with the money, wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve his goal, Vince needs to travel to the cave to join Talia and Rory, and then he can pick up the treasure that is located there.

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Vince to reach Talia and Rory, as he needs to be in the same location to interact with them and access the treasure.
   
2. **Vince picks up the treasure.** - By picking up the treasure, Vince achieves his goal of becoming wealthy, which will contribute to his happiness.

With these two actions, Vince successfully becomes wealthy and can now be happy, fulfilling his desires.
