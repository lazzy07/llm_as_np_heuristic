To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must first move to the lobby, where they can then find the gun. After acquiring the gun, the secret agent can move to the office, where they can confront and kill the mastermind. Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Lobby)**: The secret agent moves from the courtyard to the lobby. This is necessary to access the gun, which is not in the courtyard.

2. **find(SecretAgent, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent finds the gun in the lobby. This action is essential because the secret agent needs the gun to kill the mastermind.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office. This is where the mastermind is located, and the secret agent needs to be in the same location to carry out the next action.

4. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent kills the mastermind using the gun in the office. This is the final action that achieves the goal of having the mastermind dead.

The sequence of actions ensures that the secret agent successfully acquires the necessary weapon and confronts the mastermind, leading to the desired outcome.
