**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that there are three patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for his actual condition. As a result, Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to the workload. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the incorrect treatment for his actual condition. As a result, Jones dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. Young becomes healthy.
