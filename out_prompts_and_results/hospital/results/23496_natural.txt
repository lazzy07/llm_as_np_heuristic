**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, decides to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. Since Ross is the only patient left unassigned, Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C. 

Once Ross is assigned to Patient Room C, Hathaway assesses him to determine his symptoms. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Ross is experiencing a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

Next, Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to assess Jones, who is in Patient Room A. Upon assessment, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, making Jones healthy as well.

Finally, Hathaway has successfully treated both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
