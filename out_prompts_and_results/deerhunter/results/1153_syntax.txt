To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, he is greedy, and he is hungry. The bank clerk is also present and has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Bubba's greed for money.
2. **Decide to eat**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steals the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After successfully stealing the money, Bubba decides to eat, addressing his hunger.

With these actions, Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also considering his hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "decide_to_eat(Bubba)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba's greed is satisfied by acquiring the money from the clerk, and it also addresses his hunger, making it a complete and efficient resolution to the story.
