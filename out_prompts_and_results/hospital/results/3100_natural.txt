**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross and Young.

3. **Assess Ross**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is still in Admissions. Ross is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

4. **Treat Ross**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it is the correct treatment. Ross also has Flaze, so this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.

5. **Assess Young**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is still in Admissions. Young is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it is the correct treatment. Young also has Flaze, so this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although misguided due to the high workload, lead to the unfortunate outcome of all patients dying. However, Hathaway's goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy remains intact, as the intention was to treat them.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Patients**: Necessary to determine the symptoms and decide on treatment.
- **Treating Patients**: Essential to attempt to cure the patients, even though the treatments were incorrect due to the doctor's mistakes.
