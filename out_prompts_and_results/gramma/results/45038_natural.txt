To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit will loot the medicine from the corpse of the merchant. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to ensure that the medicine is not left behind and can be used or sold later.

2. The bandit will walk from the market to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the bandit to return to her preferred location and secure her coins in the chest.

3. The bandit will place the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The story unfolds as follows:

- After the bandit attacks the merchant, the merchant is dead, and the bandit now has access to the medicine.
- The bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse, ensuring she has the item.
- The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins.
- Finally, the bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins secured.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

    "loot medicine from the corpse of the merchant",
    "walk from the market to the bandit camp",
    "place the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp"
  ]

Each action is chosen to ensure the bandit achieves her goal of maximizing her coin collection while also securing the medicine, which could be beneficial for her future endeavors.
