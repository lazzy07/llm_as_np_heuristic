**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, still in the kitchen, realizes that he needs to act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's survival. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and Roy is stuck there with him. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to Roy and the gym.)
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Ernest to bypass the locked door and confront the bully without being threatened.)
3. **Ernest enters the gym.** (Now in the gym, he can take action against the bully.)
4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Roy, allowing them to be safe.)
5. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (This allows Roy to exit the gym safely.)
6. **Roy exits the gym.** (Now both characters are free from the bully's threat.)
7. **Ernest and Roy put on civilian clothes.** (This disguises them, allowing them to escape.)
