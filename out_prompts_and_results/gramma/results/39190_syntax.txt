To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to move away from the scene of the attack and towards a location where she can safely store her coins.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Crossroads, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully moves to the Crossroads and takes the coins from the chest, fulfilling her objective.
