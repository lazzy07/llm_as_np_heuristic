Rory, who is currently at the cave, realizes that he needs to return to the village to achieve his goals of happiness, wealth, and not being hungry. He decides to travel back to the village where Talia and Gargax are located. 

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - This action is necessary for Rory to be in the same location as Talia and Gargax, allowing him to interact with them and potentially improve his situation.

2. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.** - Since Talia is alive and Rory wants to be happy, proposing marriage to Talia is a step towards achieving happiness. Talia, who is also married to Rory, will accept the proposal, leading to both characters being happy.

3. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** - This action solidifies their relationship and ensures that Rory's happiness increases, fulfilling one of his goals.

After these actions, Rory is happy, wealthy (due to the treasure he picked up), and not hungry, as he is now in the village where he can access food.
