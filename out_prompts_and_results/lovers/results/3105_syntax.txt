To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room to check for the chocolates.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R22)**: Casey picks up the chocolates from the dining room.
3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey returns to the living room with the chocolates.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake, making Blake happy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to go to the dining room to find the chocolates, which is necessary for Blake's happiness.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R22)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the chocolates, which is the item Blake wants.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey must return to the living room to give the chocolates to Blake.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: This final action transfers the chocolates to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire and making them happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates, which is their desired item.
