**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully lifting weights, unaware of his presence. Roy grips the knife tightly, knowing this is his chance. He quietly drops down from the vent, landing behind the bully. With a swift motion, he plunges the knife into the bully, killing him instantly. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy quickly searches the gym and finds the pack of cigarettes the bully had hidden. He takes the cigarettes and heads back to the hallway. There, he puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier from the laundry room. Disguised, he makes his way to the highway outside the prison. 

Once on the highway, Roy successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
