**Story Completion:**

After finishing their chores in the kitchen, Roy realizes he is still threatened by the bully and wants to ensure his safety. He decides to take action to secure his freedom. 

1. **Disguise (Roy, Clothes, Laundry)**: Roy goes to the laundry room to put on the civilian clothes. This action is crucial because it allows him to disguise himself, making it possible for him to escape without being recognized by the guards or the bully.

2. **Escape (Roy, Highway)**: After disguising himself, Roy makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of being alive and free, as he is no longer threatened by the bully or confined within the prison walls.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action, disguising himself, is necessary for Roy to avoid detection while escaping. Without the civilian clothes, he would be easily recognized as a prisoner.
- The second action, escaping, is the ultimate goal for Roy, allowing him to achieve his desire to be alive and free from threats.
