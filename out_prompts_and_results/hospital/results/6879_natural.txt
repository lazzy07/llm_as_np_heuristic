Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess too many patients. Therefore, Hathaway should prioritize assessing and treating one patient at a time.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to assess Ross, who is in Exam Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing "Unknown," Hathaway will not know the actual disease yet.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - This action is necessary to treat Ross for Flaze, assuming that he has it. If Ross does not have Flaze, he will die, but this is the only option available to Hathaway at this point.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to assess Jones, who is in Exam Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is also experiencing "Unknown," Hathaway will not know the actual disease yet.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - This action is necessary to treat Jones for Flaze, assuming that he has it. If Jones does not have Flaze, he will die, but this is the only option available to Hathaway at this point.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room B to Exam Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to assess Young, who is in Exam Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is also experiencing "Unknown," Hathaway will not know the actual disease yet.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics.**  
   - This action is necessary to treat Young for Flaze, assuming that he has it. If Young does not have Flaze, he will die, but this is the only option available to Hathaway at this point.

By following this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway will have assessed and treated all patients, ensuring they are healthy, assuming they all had Flaze.
