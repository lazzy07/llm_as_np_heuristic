To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Blake and Casey are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the flowers.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that they want the flowers. This action is important because it communicates Alex's desire to Blake, who may be able to help.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers to Alex. This is the key action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way for Alex to settle back into their space after receiving the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake and Casey to communicate and receive the flowers.
- **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: This action is crucial for informing Blake about what Alex wants, which is necessary for Blake to take action.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the action that directly results in Alex obtaining the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While this does not affect Alex's happiness, it represents a return to a personal space after achieving their goal.
