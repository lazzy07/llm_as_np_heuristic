To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness or wealth. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, and Vince has the money. The treasure is also at the cave, which could potentially increase Talia's wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure.** - This action is necessary because it allows Vince to acquire the treasure, which can contribute to Talia's wealth.
2. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.** - This action is not explicitly listed in the actions available, but since Talia is married to Vince, we can assume that he would give the treasure to her, thus increasing her wealth.
3. **Talia's wealth increases.** - With the treasure now in Talia's possession, her wealth increases, which contributes to her happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Vince picks up the treasure (to acquire it).
2. Vince gives the treasure to Talia (to increase her wealth).

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy, which will make her happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Vince picks up the treasure.",
    "Vince gives the treasure to Talia."
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Vince picks up the treasure:** This is essential because it allows for the transfer of wealth to Talia, which is a key part of her goal.
- **Vince gives the treasure to Talia:** This action directly contributes to Talia's wealth, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy and, consequently, happy. 

By following this plan, Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy, which leads to her happiness.
