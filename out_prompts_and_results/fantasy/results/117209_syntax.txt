To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. The quickest way to achieve Talia's happiness is for her to marry Vince, which will make both of them happy. Since Talia is already engaged to Vince, we can proceed directly to the marriage action.
