To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already at the bank and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, he can use this to intimidate the bank clerk into giving him the money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and ensure he can take the money without resistance. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money without facing opposition.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it directly fulfills his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to remove the bank clerk as a threat, allowing Bubba to take the money without any risk of being stopped or reported.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action is taken to fulfill Bubba's goal of acquiring money, which he has decided he wants.
