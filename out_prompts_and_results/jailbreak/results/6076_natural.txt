**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to get back into the prison to help Ernest.)
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to reach the gym without being seen by the bully.)
3. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him safely.)
4. **Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for Roy to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action removes the immediate threat to both him and Ernest, allowing Roy to focus on the escape.)
6. **Roy returns to the hallway.** (This is necessary for Roy to get back to the highway where he can escape.)
7. **Roy escapes from the prison using the civilian clothes disguise.** (This final action achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's safety while ultimately leading to his escape. The locking of the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from retaliating, and retrieving the knife is necessary for self-defense. Killing the bully eliminates the threat, allowing Roy to return to the hallway and escape.
