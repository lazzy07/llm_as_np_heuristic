**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of the unknown condition. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for Jones's actual condition. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, the treatment does not lead to death, but it also does not cure Jones.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. Ross, who is still in Admissions, is then assigned to Patient Room A. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Again, due to the workload of 3, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is then assigned to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. With a workload of 3, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young, however, is healthy and survives the treatment.

In the end, Jones remains alive, achieving their goal of being alive and healthy, despite the mistakes made by Dr. Hathaway.
