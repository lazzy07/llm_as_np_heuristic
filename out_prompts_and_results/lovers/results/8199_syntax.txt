To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they want I1, which is in the same room (R22) as Alex, Casey, and Blake. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want. This action is necessary because Blake needs to be happy as well, and they cannot do that while in R22.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R21). This is necessary for Blake to achieve their happiness.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey. This is important for Blake to interact with them and help Alex.

4. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they just picked up for the jewelry (I1) that Alex wants. This action is crucial because it directly helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness.

5. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex now has the jewelry (I1) they wanted, making them happy. This is the final action that ensures Alex achieves their goal.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
