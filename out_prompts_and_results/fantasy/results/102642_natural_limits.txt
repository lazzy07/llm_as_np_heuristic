In the village, Gargax, feeling increasingly hungry, decides to take action. He spots Vince, who has the money, and sees an opportunity to satisfy his hunger. Gargax eats Vince, which eliminates Vince from the story. With Vince gone, Talia, who is now free from her marriage to Vince, can focus on her own happiness and wealth. 

Gargax, having eaten Vince, now has the money that Vince possessed. Talia, realizing that she is now single and that Gargax has the money, approaches Gargax. She proposes a partnership, suggesting that they can work together to find the treasure in the cave. Gargax, now wealthy with Vince's money, agrees to Talia's proposal, which makes Talia happy as she sees a path to wealth and happiness.
