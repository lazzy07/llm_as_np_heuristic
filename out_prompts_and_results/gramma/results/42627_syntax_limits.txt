- walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, while carrying the medicine. Since there are no other characters at the cottage to interfere with him, this action allows Tom to successfully complete his goal without any conflict.
