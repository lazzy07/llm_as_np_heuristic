Zoe, at the cave, realizes that the surface is dangerous and that the Lizard, as the guardian, is in a precarious situation. Understanding that she needs to make friends with the Lizard to ensure both their safety, she decides to take action. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and show her willingness to engage with it, rather than remaining in the cave where she is safe but isolated. 

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendly relationship, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and friendship.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - This action symbolizes their newfound friendship and ensures that they are both safe from the dangers of the surface, as they can now work together to protect each other.

Through these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of making friends with Zoe, while also ensuring both characters are healthy and safe.
