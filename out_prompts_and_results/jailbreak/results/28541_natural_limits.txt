After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs to protect himself and Ernest from the bully. He quickly moves back to the kitchen, retrieves the knife, and then heads to the hallway. 

In the hallway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the gym, where the bully is still locked inside.
