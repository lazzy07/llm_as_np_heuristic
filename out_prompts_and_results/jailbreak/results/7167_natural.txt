**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway. He knows he needs to escape before the bully finds him. He takes a moment to gather his thoughts and then makes a run for it, heading towards the exit of the prison grounds.

Meanwhile, Roy is still in the laundry room, unaware of Ernest's successful disguise and escape. He decides to take a risk and heads to the hallway, hoping to find Ernest. 

**Actions:**
1. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (Ernest is already on the highway and wearing civilian clothes, so he can escape without being caught.)
2. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (Roy is trying to find Ernest, but he doesn't know where he is.)
3. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action is unnecessary for the goal since Ernest has already escaped, but it could be a precautionary measure if he encounters the bully.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's escape is the primary goal, and since he is already on the highway and disguised, he successfully leaves the prison.
- Roy's action of moving to the hallway is an attempt to find Ernest, but it does not affect the outcome since Ernest has already achieved his goal of escaping.
- Locking the gym door is a precautionary measure that does not impact the story's conclusion since Ernest is already free.
