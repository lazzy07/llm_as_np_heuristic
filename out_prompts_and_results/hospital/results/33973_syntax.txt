To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Since Young is already assigned to PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway will then walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones and Ross, who are currently there and have not been assigned to any exam room yet.

4. **Admit Jones to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will admit Jones to PatientRoomB, allowing for further assessment and treatment.

5. **Admit Ross to PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will admit Ross to PatientRoomC, allowing for further assessment and treatment.

6. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified.

8. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms.

9. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified.
