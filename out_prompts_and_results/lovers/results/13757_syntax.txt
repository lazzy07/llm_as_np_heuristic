To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey has the jewelry, and Blake knows that Alex wants the chocolates (I1). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake (C2) can trade the jewelry (I2) they want with Casey (C3) for the chocolates (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they desire while also ensuring that Casey is happy with the chocolates.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will have the jewelry (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I1) and will also be happy.
- Alex will still be unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I3), but since the goal is for Blake to be happy, this trade fulfills that requirement.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness. It directly addresses Blake's desire for the jewelry while also considering Casey's happiness.
