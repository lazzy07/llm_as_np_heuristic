To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but for the sake of this story, we will assume Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's symptoms.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment. If Jones has Flaze, he receives antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis, he receives steroids. This treatment is essential for Jones to recover and achieve his goal of being healthy.

By following these actions, Jones will successfully become healthy.
