**Story Completion:**

After finishing their chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, while Roy is in the gym with the bully. Roy, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, so he quickly moves to the hallway to access the kitchen.

2. **steal(Roy, Knife, Kitchen)**: Roy steals the knife from the kitchen. This is crucial for him to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.

3. **go(Roy, Gym)**: Roy then moves to the gym, where the bully is still engaged in recreation. This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully directly.

4. **revenge(Roy, Bully, Gym)**: Finally, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully in the gym. This action ensures that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to feel safe.
