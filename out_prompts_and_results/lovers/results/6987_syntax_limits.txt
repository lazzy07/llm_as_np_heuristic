In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy. Since Alex is in the living room (R22) and believes that the jewelry is with Casey (C3), who is also in the living room, Alex can simply give the jewelry to Casey. 

To achieve this, Alex can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the item they have (which is the flowers, I3) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I1) while also ensuring that Casey is happy with the flowers (I3).

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3) and will also be happy.

This single action allows Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
