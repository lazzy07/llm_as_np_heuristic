Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to an exam room. Since Young is experiencing a rash, Hathaway assigns Young to Patient Room C. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of Young's condition.

Next, Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and observes the rash. Recognizing the symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for the disease. This successfully makes Young healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

The actions taken are as follows:
1. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: This is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat them.
2. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: This action is crucial for identifying Young's symptoms and determining the correct treatment.
3. **Treat Young with steroids**: This action is essential for curing Young of Jarkis, thus achieving Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
