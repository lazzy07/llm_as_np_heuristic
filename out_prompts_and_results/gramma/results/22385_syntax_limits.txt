To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. Since the medicine is with the Merchant at the Crossroads, Tom can simply walk to the Cottage without needing to interact with any other characters or items. This action directly fulfills Tom's goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because it allows Tom to reach his desired location (the Cottage) where he wants to be carrying the medicine. There are no other actions needed since he is already at the Crossroads where the Merchant is located, and he does not need to engage in any conflict or transactions to achieve his goal.
