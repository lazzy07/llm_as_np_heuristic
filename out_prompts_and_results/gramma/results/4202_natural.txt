**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, believing that the hero is at the camp and wanting to maximize her coins, decides to walk from the camp to the crossroads. This action is necessary for her to reach a location where she can potentially find more customers or opportunities to sell her items.

2. Upon reaching the crossroads, the merchant sees the guard at the market and decides to report the location of the bandit. This action is crucial because it aligns with her goal of not becoming a criminal; by reporting the bandit, she distances herself from criminal activity and potentially earns favor with the guard.

3. The guard, upon receiving the information from the merchant, walks from the market to the bandit camp to confront the bandit. This action is necessary for the guard to fulfill his goal of eliminating criminals.

4. The guard arrives at the bandit camp and, believing the bandit is there, attacks and kills the bandit. This action is essential as it removes the threat of the bandit, allowing the merchant to operate freely without fear of robbery.

5. After the bandit is dead, the guard loots the banditâ€™s corpse and takes the coins from the chest. This action is necessary for the guard to fulfill his duty and also provides the merchant with a potential opportunity to negotiate or trade with the guard.

6. The guard then walks back to the crossroads, where the merchant is waiting. This action allows the guard to return to a safe location and potentially share the spoils with the merchant.

7. The merchant, now seeing the guard with the coins, offers to buy some items from him, using the hero's coin she has. This action is necessary for the merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal.

8. The merchant successfully buys the items from the guard, thus achieving her goal of maximizing her coins.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by the merchant, guard, and bandit is necessary to ensure that the merchant can achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. The merchant's decision to report the bandit is pivotal in maintaining her non-criminal status while also allowing her to profit from her dealings with the guard.
