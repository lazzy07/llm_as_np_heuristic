After Bubba shoots Bambi, he realizes he is still hungry. He decides to eat Bambi, which is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger. Since Bubba has no money and does not want to have any, he does not pursue the bank clerk for money. The story ends with Bubba having eaten Bambi, which fulfills his need for food, and Bambi is confirmed dead.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba decides to eat Bambi. (This action fulfills Bubba's hunger.)
2. Bubba eats Bambi. (This action confirms Bambi is dead and satisfies Bubba's hunger.)

The final state is:
- Bubba is alive and has eaten Bambi.
- Bambi is dead.
- Bubba has 0 money, which aligns with his desire to have 0 money.

Thus, the story ends with Bambi being dead, fulfilling the requirement.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
