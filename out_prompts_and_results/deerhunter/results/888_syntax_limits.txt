To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides a sense of closure to the story, showing Bubba escaping with the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk, who is the only one with money and poses a threat to Bubba's plan.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money, which is one of the two possible endings we are aiming for.
