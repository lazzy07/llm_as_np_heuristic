To achieve the goal of the Secret Agent, which is to kill the Mastermind, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Office to the Lobby. This is necessary because the Mastermind is believed to be in the Lobby, and the Secret Agent needs to confront them there.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Courtyard)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Courtyard. This action is included to position the Secret Agent closer to the Mastermind, as the next logical step is to confront them.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent returns to the Lobby. This is necessary to ensure that the Secret Agent is in the correct location to confront the Mastermind.

4. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent uses the Gun to kill the Mastermind in the Lobby. This is the final action that achieves the Secret Agent's goal of eliminating the Mastermind.
