Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing Young, Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room C. Since Ross is still in admissions and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway can assign them to an exam room without increasing their workload. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C and finds that Ross has a rash, indicating they have Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing them as well. 

With both Young and Ross treated and healthy, Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
