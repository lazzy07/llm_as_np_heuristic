Tom, having just looted the medicine from the merchant, realizes he needs to get back to the cottage to use it. He knows the bandit is armed and dangerous, but he also knows that the guard is nearby. 

To ensure his safety, Tom decides to report the bandit’s location to the guard. This action will alert the guard to the bandit’s presence, allowing the guard to take action against the bandit, thus clearing the way for Tom to safely return to the cottage.
