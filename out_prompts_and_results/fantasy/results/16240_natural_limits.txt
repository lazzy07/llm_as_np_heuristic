In the village, Talia and Rory are married, but Talia is unhappy and has no wealth. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and has traveled to the village. Rory has taken the money from Vince, who is dead. 

To achieve Talia's happiness or wealth, the following actions take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** This action is necessary because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Rory, Gargax can take the money Rory has, which will make Gargax wealthy. This action also removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her own goals without Rory's influence.

2. **Gargax gives Talia the money.** Gargax, now wealthy after eating Rory, decides to give Talia the money. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Talia's desire to be wealthy, which will lead to her happiness.

After these actions, Talia becomes wealthy and, as a result, happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory:** This action eliminates Rory, who has the money, and allows Gargax to fulfill his hunger and desire for wealth.
- **Gargax gives Talia the money:** This action fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, which in turn makes her happy.
