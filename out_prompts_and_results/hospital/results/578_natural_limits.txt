**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C with Jones, decides to admit Ross to an exam room. Since Ross is experiencing Fever, Hathaway assigns him to Exam Room A. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 1.

Next, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Upon assessment, Hathaway recognizes that Jones is experiencing Fever. Since Jones has Fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy and reduces Hathaway's workload back to 0.

After treating Jones, Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young, who is still there. Young is experiencing Rash, so Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B. However, since the goal is to ensure Jones is healthy, the story concludes here.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: This is necessary to ensure that all patients are being attended to, and it increases Hathaway's workload, allowing for the next steps.
2. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: This is crucial for determining Jones's symptoms and ensuring he receives the correct treatment.
3. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This is the correct treatment for Jones's Fever, ensuring he becomes healthy, which is his goal.
4. **Walk back to Admissions**: This action is included to show Hathaway's intention to continue helping other patients, but the story ends with Jones being healthy.
