Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room A. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of Young's condition. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A and observes the rash, which indicates that Young has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

This sequence of actions ensures that all patients are treated correctly, and since Young is now healthy, Hathaway achieves their goal.
