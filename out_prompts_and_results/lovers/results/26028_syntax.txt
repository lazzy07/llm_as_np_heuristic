To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Alex for the flowers (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to give away an item they do not want in exchange for an item that Alex wants, which may lead to Alex being happy and more willing to help Casey.

3. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This is the crucial action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness, as they now possess the item they want.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: This is the final action that directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
