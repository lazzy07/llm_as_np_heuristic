To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness through marriage or wealth through acquiring treasure. Since Talia is already engaged to Rory, we can take advantage of that relationship to ensure her happiness.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village to be with Talia. This action is necessary because Talia is in the Village, and for them to get married, Rory needs to be there.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married in the Village. This action makes both characters happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: This action is essential for Rory to return to Talia so they can proceed with their marriage. Without this action, they cannot be together to complete the next step.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action directly fulfills Talia's goal of becoming happy through marriage. Since she has accepted Rory's proposal, their marriage will ensure both characters achieve happiness.
