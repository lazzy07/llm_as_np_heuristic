In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Market, where she can see Tom, the Merchant, and the Guard. The Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit is armed and the Merchant is also armed, the Bandit cannot rob or attack the Merchant. However, the Bandit can take advantage of the situation by robbing Tom, who is unarmed.
