To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to have an item to offer in exchange for the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary to interact with them and facilitate the exchange.

4. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up for the jewelry (I1) with Casey. This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **put_down(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey puts down the jewelry (I1) in the living room after the trade. This action is necessary to finalize the trade and ensure that the jewelry is now with Alex.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy.
