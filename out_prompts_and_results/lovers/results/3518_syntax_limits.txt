In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item that is currently with Casey). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake achieving their goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and Casey.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy. 

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the item they want (I3).
- Blake will also be happy because they have helped Alex achieve happiness.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- The first action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex and Casey to facilitate the next action.
- The second action is the key to ensuring that Alex receives the item they want, thus achieving Blake's goal of making Alex happy.
