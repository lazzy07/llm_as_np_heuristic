**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway. He knows he needs to escape before the bully finds him. He takes a moment to gather his thoughts and then makes a run for it, heading towards the edge of the highway where he can blend in with the outside world.

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the laundry room, is unaware of Ernest's escape. He decides to take a risk and heads to the hallway, hoping to find Ernest. However, he is still vulnerable to the bully's threats.

As Ernest reaches the edge of the highway, he looks back at the prison one last time, feeling a mix of fear and exhilaration. He knows that he has successfully escaped and is now free from the threats of the bully and the confines of the prison.
