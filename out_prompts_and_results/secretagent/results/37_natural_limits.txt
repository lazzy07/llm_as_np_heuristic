The secret agent, now armed with the gun and holding the papers, realizes that the mastermind is likely hiding in the office, believing the secret agent is still at the dropbox. The secret agent decides to move to the office to confront the mastermind.

1. The secret agent moves from the cache to the office. (This action is necessary to reach the mastermind, who is believed to be in the office.)
2. The secret agent kills the mastermind with the gun. (This action fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.)

After these actions, the mastermind is dead, and the secret agent has successfully completed their mission.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Move to the office**: This is essential for the secret agent to confront the mastermind directly, as the mastermind is unaware of the secret agent's presence and believes they are safe.
- **Kill the mastermind**: This action is the ultimate goal of the secret agent, ensuring that the mastermind cannot pose a threat any longer.
