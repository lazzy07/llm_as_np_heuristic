To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of having money. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - Bubba is greedy and wants the money, so he decides to take it from the clerk.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to be in the same location as the clerk, which is necessary for the next actions.
- **Deciding to steal** indicates Bubba's intention to take the money, which aligns with his goal of acquiring wealth.
- **Stealing the money** is the final action that ensures Bubba achieves his goal of having money.
