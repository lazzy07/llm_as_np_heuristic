To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. The bandit robs the merchant to take the medicine. 
   - This action is necessary because the bandit needs to ensure that the merchant has no items that could be used against her, and it also allows the bandit to have the medicine, which could be useful later.

2. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she has.

3. The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.
   - This action is necessary to secure the medicine in a safe location, ensuring that she has it available for future use.

4. The bandit takes the coins from the chest.
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

5. The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move to a more advantageous position, potentially to interact with other characters or to escape if needed.

6. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to the market, where she can continue her activities or interact with other characters.

The final sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest and carrying the medicine.
