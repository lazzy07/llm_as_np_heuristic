1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action is necessary because it removes Talia from the story, allowing Rory to focus on his goals without the complication of Talia's presence. Since Talia is married to Rory, her death will not affect his happiness negatively, as he is already married to her.

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure.** - This action allows Gargax to fulfill his goal of becoming wealthy by acquiring the treasure.

5. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - Rory needs to return to the village to be with Talia and to ensure he is not hungry.

6. **Rory picks up the money from Vince's body.** - This action allows Rory to become wealthy by taking the money that Vince had.

7. **Rory proposes to Talia.** - This action is necessary for Rory to reaffirm his commitment to Talia, ensuring his happiness.

8. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** - This action solidifies their relationship and increases Rory's happiness.
