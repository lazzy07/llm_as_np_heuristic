In this story, Zoe is in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The volcano has begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, but their relationship is currently strained. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the story ends with the volcano erupting, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and attempt to make peace.
   
2. **Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard.** Since they are now in the same location and not fighting, Zoe can try to establish a friendship. This action is crucial for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This action is included to fulfill the requirement that the story ends with the volcano erupting. Since the surface is dangerous, this eruption will lead to a character's demise.

4. **The Lizard dies due to the eruption.** This is the consequence of the volcano erupting while the Lizard is on the surface, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

5. **Zoe is safe in the cave.** Since Zoe is not on the surface when the volcano erupts, she remains healthy and safe, but she has lost the opportunity to befriend the Lizard.

The final sequence of actions leads to the Lizard's death due to the eruption while Zoe attempts to make peace, which ultimately fails due to the circumstances.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that the story meets the specified ending conditions while maintaining the integrity of the characters' goals and actions.
