In this story, Young is in exam room C and wants to be alive and healthy. Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in exam room C with Young. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, they may make a mistake in assessing the symptoms. However, Young is already in the exam room, and Hathaway can treat them directly.

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is in exam room C, Hathaway can check for any symptoms of either Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This action is necessary to understand what treatment Young needs.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a rash, Hathaway will administer steroids for Jarkis. If Young has a fever, Hathaway will mistakenly treat them for Flaze due to their high workload, but since Young is healthy, they will still recover.

By taking these actions, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
