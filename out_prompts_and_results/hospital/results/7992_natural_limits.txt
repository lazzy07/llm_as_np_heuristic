Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room A.** This action is necessary to start the process of diagnosing and treating Jones, who is currently in the admissions room. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B.** This action allows Dr. Hathaway to also address Ross's health needs. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 4.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A.** This action is crucial for determining Jones's symptoms. However, since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 4, there is a risk of making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids.** This action is based on the incorrect assessment. Since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.** This action is successful, and Ross becomes healthy.
