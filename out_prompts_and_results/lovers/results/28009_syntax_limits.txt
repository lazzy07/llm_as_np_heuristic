In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex is currently unhappy because they want item I3, which is in the same room as Blake. To achieve their goal, Blake can give item I3 to Alex, making both of them happy.

Here’s the action Blake will take:

1. **give(Blake, I3, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives item I3 to Alex in the living room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they receive the item they want (I3). Since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, this action fulfills both of their desires.

After this action, the happiness status will be:
- happy(Blake) = True (because Blake is happy by making Alex happy)
- happy(Alex) = True (because Alex received the item they wanted)
- happy(Casey) = False (Casey remains unhappy as they still want item I2)

Blake achieves their goal of being happy by ensuring Alex is happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["give(Blake, I3, Alex, R22)"]
