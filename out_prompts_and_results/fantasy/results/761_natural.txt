To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax, who is at the cave, will eat Rory. This action is necessary because Rory is currently unhappy and wealthless, and by removing him from the equation, Talia can focus on her own happiness and wealth without the complication of Rory's presence.

2. **Talia takes the money from Rory's dead body**: After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can take the money from Rory's body. This action is crucial for Talia to increase her wealth, as she currently has no money.

3. **Talia's happiness increases**: With the treasure she already possesses and the money she has just taken, Talia's wealth increases, and she can now feel a sense of accomplishment and happiness.

4. **Talia proposes to Vince**: Talia, now wealthy and feeling happy, proposes to Vince. This action is important as it aligns with her goal of being happy.

5. **Vince accepts the proposal**: Vince, who is also not hungry and wants to be happy, accepts Talia's proposal. This action leads to both characters achieving happiness.

6. **Talia and Vince get married**: The marriage solidifies Talia's happiness and fulfills her goal of being happy.

Now, Talia is wealthy (having taken Rory's money) and happy (through her marriage to Vince), achieving her goals.
