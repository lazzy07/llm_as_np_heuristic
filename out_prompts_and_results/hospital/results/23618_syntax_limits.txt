**Story Completion:**

After assessing Jones in PatientRoomA, Hathaway realizes that Jones is showing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). However, due to Hathaway's workload being at 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. To ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Jones immediately with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action reduces Hathaway's workload by one and ensures that Jones becomes healthy.

After this action, Jones is now healthy, and Hathaway has successfully achieved their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
