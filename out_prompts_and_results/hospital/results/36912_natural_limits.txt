Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway is determined to help all patients. After assessing Ross, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to the high workload. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross actually has Jarkis. Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's demise.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Young. Upon assessment, Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Jones. Since Jones is still in Admissions and has not been treated, Hathaway assesses him and finds he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the initial mistake with Ross.
