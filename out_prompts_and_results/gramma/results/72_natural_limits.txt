**Story Completion:**

As the bandit stands at the market, she notices the merchant holding the medicine. The bandit decides to take action. 

1. The bandit, armed with her sword, approaches the merchant and robs her, taking the medicine. This action is necessary for the bandit to acquire an item of value, which aligns with her goal of carrying as many coins or valuable items as possible.

2. With the medicine in hand, the bandit quickly walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her newly acquired item. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to secure her loot and fulfill her goal of having valuable items in her possession.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (robbing the merchant) is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying valuable items, as the medicine is a significant item.
- The second action (walking back to the bandit camp) ensures that the bandit can keep the medicine safe and out of reach of the guard or any other characters who might threaten her.
