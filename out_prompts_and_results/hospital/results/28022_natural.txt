**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that there are still patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Jones to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room B. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway, now with a workload of 2, correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to check on Jones. Since Jones is still in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway assesses Jones. After determining that Jones is experiencing Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, and Jones becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young and Jones, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
