To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market and head towards the crossroads to get closer to the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom will continue on to the cottage, where he wants to be.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage with the medicine he looted from the merchant. The other characters are not involved in actions that would prevent Tom from achieving his goal, as the bandit is currently focused on her own objectives and the guard is not in a position to interfere.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **First Action (walk from Market to Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market, where he is currently located, and move towards the crossroads, which is the only path leading to the cottage.
  
- **Second Action (walk from Crossroads to Cottage)**: This action is essential for Tom to reach his final destination, the cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine.
