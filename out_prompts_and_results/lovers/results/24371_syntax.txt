To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) since they are currently in the same room.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C3) to make them happy.
5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I1) since it is in the same room.
6. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room.
7. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Casey.
8. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1), making Alex happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Casey moves to R21** to access the chocolates, which is necessary for them to help Blake.
- **Casey picks up I2** to have an item to give to Blake, which is part of their goal to make Blake happy.
- **Casey moves back to R22** to be with the other characters and facilitate the next action.
- **Casey gives I2 to C3** to ensure Blake is happy, which is part of the interconnected happiness goals.
- **Blake moves to R21** to access the jewelry, which is necessary for Alex's happiness.
- **Blake picks up I1** to have the item that Alex wants.
- **Blake moves back to R22** to be with Alex and Casey for the final exchange.
- **Blake gives I1 to C1** to fulfill Alex's desire, thus making Alex happy.

By following this sequence, Alex achieves their goal of happiness by receiving the jewelry.
