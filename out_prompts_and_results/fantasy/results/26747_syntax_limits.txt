In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She has already proposed to Rory, who has accepted her proposal, which means they are now engaged and both are happy. However, Talia also wants to be wealthy, and she currently possesses the treasure but lacks money. 

To achieve her goal of being wealthy, Talia can take the following actions:

1. **Travel from the Cave to the Village**: Talia needs to go to the Village where Vince is located, as he has the money.
2. **Take the Money from Vince**: Talia can take the money from Vince, which will make her wealthy.
