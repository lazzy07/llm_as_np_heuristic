**Story Completion:**

After Roy successfully disguises himself with the civilian clothes on the highway, he realizes that he needs to ensure Ernest can escape too. However, he knows that the bully is still a threat to both of them. 

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Highway)**: Roy locks the gym door from the outside, preventing the bully from coming out and threatening them. This action is crucial because it secures the area and keeps the bully contained, allowing Roy to focus on the next steps without immediate danger.

2. **go(Ernest, Hall)**: Roy then calls out to Ernest, encouraging him to move to the hallway. This action is necessary to get Ernest closer to the escape route.

3. **vent(Ernest, Highway)**: Once in the hallway, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is essential for Ernest to join Roy and escape the prison.

4. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: With the bully locked in the gym and Ernest now on the highway, Roy takes the final step to escape the prison. This action fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.
