In this story, Rory is currently in the cave with the money he took from Vince, who is dead. Talia is in the village, and Gargax is also in the village. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, Rory needs to secure the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will allow Rory to achieve his goal:
