To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the Clerk, who is the only character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the Bank. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can return to the Forest with the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the scene with the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where the money is.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the Clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba takes the money, achieving his goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the Bank with the money.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the story's requirements.
