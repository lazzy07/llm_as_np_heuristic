To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to be in a position to interact with Casey and Blake.
   - **Reason**: This action allows Alex to be in the same room as Casey, who has the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex.
   - **Reason**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to be with Alex and Casey.
   - **Reason**: This action allows Blake to be present with both Alex and Casey, which is important for Blake's happiness as well.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to join Alex and Blake.
   - **Reason**: This action ensures that all characters are together, which is important for their relationships and happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy. Casey will still have chocolates (I2) and Blake will have flowers (I3), but since Alex's happiness is the goal, the story ends here.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R12)",
    "move(C2, R22, R12)",
    "move(C3, R22, R12)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the crucial action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to be with Alex and Casey, which is important for their relationship.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to join the others, ensuring all characters are together, which is beneficial for their happiness. 

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
