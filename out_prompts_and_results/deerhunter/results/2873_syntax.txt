To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just shot Bambi, and is hungry. He also knows that the bank clerk has money. The most efficient way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to go to the bank and steal the money from the clerk, as he is greedy and wants money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where the money is, and the second action allows him to take the money from the clerk.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba leaves the forest where he shot Bambi and heads to the bank, where he knows the clerk has money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba uses his rifle to intimidate the clerk and steals the money.

Now, Bubba has successfully obtained money, fulfilling his goal.
