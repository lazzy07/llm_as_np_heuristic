To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and potentially make peace.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship between them, which is one of their goals.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption that will lead to a character's demise.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action is the culmination of the previous actions and results in a character dying.

5. **kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)**: Since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she dies as a result of the eruption. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

By following this sequence, we ensure that the story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying (Zoe), and the Lizard and Zoe making peace before the eruption.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe needs to approach the Lizard to interact with him.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action is essential for establishing a friendship, which is a goal for both characters.
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Initiates the volcanic eruption, which is a critical plot point.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Executes the eruption, leading to the consequences of the story.
- **kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)**: Zoe's death is a direct result of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
