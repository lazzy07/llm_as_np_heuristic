Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess each patient in their assigned exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**
   - This action is also necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Again, Hathaway's workload remains high, but assessing Jones is crucial for treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**
   - This final assessment is needed to understand Young's symptoms. By assessing all patients, Hathaway can make informed treatment decisions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**
   - Assuming Ross has Flaze (due to the high workload and potential for error), Hathaway treats him with the appropriate medication. If Ross indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids.**
   - Assuming Jones has Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate medication. If Jones indeed has Jarkis, he will become healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**
   - Assuming Young also has Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids as well. If Young has Jarkis, he will become healthy.

By assessing and treating all patients, Dr. Hathaway ensures that all patients are healthy, achieving their goal.
