To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry. This is essential as it allows Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room. This is necessary for Casey to be in a position to give the jewelry to Alex.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, making them happy.
