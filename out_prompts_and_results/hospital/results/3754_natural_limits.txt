Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on him without increasing her workload significantly. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. She discovers that Ross has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand how to treat Ross effectively.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to a room where he can be assessed and treated later.

4. **Walk from Patient Room B to Admissions**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones. This action is important as it allows Hathaway to continue her work in ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, ensuring he is healthy, and prepares to assess Jones next.
