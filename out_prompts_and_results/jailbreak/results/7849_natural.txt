**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, who is in the hallway, realizes that he needs to help Ernest. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that the gym door is locked. Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to bypass the locked door and reach Ernest without the bully being aware of his presence.)
   
2. **Roy gives the knife to Ernest.** (This action empowers Ernest to defend himself against the bully, ensuring that he is not threatened anymore.)

3. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, allowing both Ernest and Roy to feel safe.)

4. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action disguises Roy, preparing him for a potential escape.)

5. **Roy and Ernest move to the hallway.** (This action allows them to regroup and plan their escape together.)

8. **Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** (This action fulfills their goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to help Roy and Ernest eliminate the threat of the bully and ultimately escape the prison. The use of the knife is crucial for self-defense, while the civilian clothes are necessary for disguise during the escape. Crawling through the vents allows them to avoid detection and reach safety.
