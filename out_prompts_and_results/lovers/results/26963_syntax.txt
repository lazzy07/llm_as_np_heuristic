To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Action: move(C3, R22, R21)** - Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where Alex and Casey are currently located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and Casey directly.

2. **Action: tell(C3, C2, I2, R21)** - Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move because Casey currently does not have the chocolates and believes that Alex wants them. This action is meant to influence Casey's next move.

3. **Action: move(C2, R21, R22)** - Casey moves to the living room (R22) to retrieve the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to fulfill the belief that Alex wants the chocolates.

4. **Action: pick_up(C2, I2, R22)** - Casey picks up the chocolates from the living room. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **Action: move(C2, R22, R21)** - Casey returns to the dining room (R21) with the chocolates. This is necessary to give the chocolates to Alex.

6. **Action: give(C2, I2, C1, R21)** - Casey gives the chocolates to Alex. This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

7. **Action: move(C3, R21, R22)** - Blake moves back to the living room (R22) after ensuring Alex is happy. This is a transition to conclude the story.

At this point, Alex is happy because they received the chocolates, and Blake is happy because they helped Alex achieve happiness. Casey is still unhappy because they wanted the jewelry, but Blake's goal was to ensure Alex's happiness, which has been achieved.
