Ernest, knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, decides to take a risk. He moves quickly through the hallway and crawls through the vents to the gym. Once inside, he finds the bully, who is unaware of his presence. 

Ernest, with the knife in hand, confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he kills the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened. With the bully out of the way, Ernest takes a moment to catch his breath and then remembers the civilian clothes in the laundry room.
