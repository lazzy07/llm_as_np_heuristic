**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that both Jones and Ross are still in the admissions room and need to be assigned to exam rooms, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Since Jones is still in Admissions, Hathaway assesses Jones first. During the assessment, Hathaway discovers that Jones is experiencing a fever, indicating that Jones has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is also in Admissions. During the assessment, Hathaway finds that Ross has a rash, indicating that Ross has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C to check on Young, who is still in the admissions room. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that Young is experiencing a fever, indicating that Young also has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Jones, Ross, and Young—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
