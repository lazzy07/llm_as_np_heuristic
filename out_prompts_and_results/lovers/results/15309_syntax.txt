To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R22) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) has put down the jewelry in the dining room. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from Casey, who has put it down in the dining room. This action is necessary because Alex needs to obtain the item they want to be happy.

2. **move(C1, R22, R22)**: This action is redundant as Alex is already in the dining room, but it can be included to signify that Alex is now in possession of the jewelry and is in the right place to be happy.

3. **happy(C1) = True**: After picking up the jewelry, Alex is now happy because they have the item they wanted.

The other characters (Blake and Casey) are not directly involved in this sequence since the goal is solely to make Alex happy. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is the item they want to be happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R22)**: While this action does not change Alex's location, it signifies that Alex is now in the right state to be happy with the jewelry in hand. 

This sequence ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness efficiently.
