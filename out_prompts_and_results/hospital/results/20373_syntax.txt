To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Jones is in PatientRoomB, Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing Jones's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Next, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room. This will help Hathaway understand Ross's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomC to identify his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated correctly.

4. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is necessary to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered.
