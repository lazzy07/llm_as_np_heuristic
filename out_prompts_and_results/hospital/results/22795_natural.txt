**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, noticing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Jones is in Patient Room A, Hathaway administers antibiotics to treat the fever. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Jones's symptoms, ensuring he becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Ross is also in Patient Room A but is experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, he can still assess Ross without making a mistake. He assesses Ross and discovers that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is still experiencing unknown symptoms, but Hathaway can assess him next. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This is necessary because Jones has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. Treating him correctly ensures he becomes healthy.
   
2. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway's workload is still manageable, he can assess Ross without making a mistake. This is important to identify Ross's condition accurately.

3. **Treat Ross with steroids**: After assessing Ross and discovering he has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway treats him correctly, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated later.
