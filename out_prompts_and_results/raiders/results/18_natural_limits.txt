**Story Completion:**

After arriving back in the USA with the Ark, Indiana Jones realizes the imminent threat posed by the Nazis, who are also in pursuit of the Ark. Knowing that the Ark is dangerous, he decides to keep it hidden. However, the Nazis, believing the Ark is safe, confront Indiana Jones, demanding he hand it over.

1. **The Nazis take the Ark from Indiana Jones by force.** (The Nazis are armed and believe they can use the Ark to achieve immortality.)
2. **The U.S. Army arrives and confronts the Nazis.** (The U.S. Army, also armed, wants to secure the Ark for their own purposes.)
3. **The U.S. Army takes the Ark from the Nazis by force.** (The U.S. Army is armed and believes the Ark is crucial for national security.)
4. **The U.S. Army opens the Ark.** (The U.S. Army believes the Ark is safe, but it is actually dangerous, leading to the demise of the Nazis.)

In this sequence, the actions are necessary to ensure that the U.S. Army ends up with the Ark while eliminating the Nazis. The Nazis' belief in the Ark's safety leads to their downfall when the U.S. Army opens it, resulting in their deaths.
