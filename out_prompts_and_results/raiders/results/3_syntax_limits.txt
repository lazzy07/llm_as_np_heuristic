After arriving in Tanis, Indiana Jones quickly assesses the situation. He knows the Ark of the Covenant is buried nearby and that both the Nazis and the US Army are also in Tanis, each with their own intentions for the Ark. 

1. **Jones digs up the Ark.** He believes the Ark is in Tanis, and he needs to secure it before the Nazis can get their hands on it. This action is crucial as it allows him to gain possession of the Ark.
