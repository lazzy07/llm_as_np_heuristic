**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones and Ross, who are currently in the admissions room and have unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Ross will help Dr. Hathaway understand his condition and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway needs to treat him in the assigned exam room.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), this treatment will make him healthy. If he has Flaze, this would be a mistake, but the goal is to ensure Young achieves their goal.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to return to Admissions to assess Young.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - This assessment will determine Young's symptoms and allow for the correct treatment.

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.**  
   - After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway needs to treat him in the assigned exam room.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Young has a fever (symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The actions taken are focused on assessing and treating the patients in a way that maximizes the chance of them becoming healthy. Dr. Hathaway's movement between rooms is necessary to fulfill the requirements of assessing and treating each patient. The assessments are crucial to determine the correct treatment, and the treatments are aimed at ensuring the patients achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.
