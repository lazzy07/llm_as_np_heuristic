To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk from the Crossroads to the Market to confront the Merchant and take the coins she has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coins that the Merchant has. This action is possible because the Merchant is unarmed and the Bandit is armed.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will take the coins from the Merchant and then walk to the Bandit Camp to place the coins in the chest. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in the chest at her camp, fulfilling her goal.

The actions are necessary to achieve the Bandit's goal of acquiring coins without being killed or caught by the Guard. The Bandit successfully robs the Merchant and secures the coins in her camp.
