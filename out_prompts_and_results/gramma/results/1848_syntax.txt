To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently carrying a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the camp. This action is necessary to ensure that she has the coins in her possession, completing her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action (rob) is crucial for the Bandit to acquire a coin from Tom, which directly contributes to her goal of having coins.
- The second action (walk) is essential for the Bandit to move to a location where she can secure her loot.
- The third action (take) ensures that the Bandit has the coins in her possession, which is the ultimate goal.
