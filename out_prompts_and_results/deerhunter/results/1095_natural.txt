Bubba is determined to get money, and since he is currently in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, he decides to take action to achieve his goal. 

1. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to intimidate or threaten someone to get money.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located to confront him and obtain the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now threaten the clerk to hand over the money.)

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of obtaining money.
