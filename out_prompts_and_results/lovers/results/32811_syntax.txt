To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). Currently, I2 is in an unknown location, and Casey has I3 (the chocolates), which they want. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to interact with Alex to help Blake.
   
2. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I2) in the dining room (R12). This is a lie since Casey actually wants the chocolates (I3), but it will help Alex to believe that I2 is the item they need to focus on.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Blake and help them achieve their goal.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Casey in the living room (R22). This is necessary because Casey is now in possession of I2, which they can then give to Blake.

5. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake in the living room (R22). This is the final action that ensures Blake receives the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry (I2), which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to communicate.
- **tell(C3, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey lies to Alex about wanting I2 to redirect Alex's actions.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to move to Blake to give them the item.
- **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, who is now in the right room.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire.
