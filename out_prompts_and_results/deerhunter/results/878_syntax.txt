To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money rather than earning it through other means.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba will find Bambi, the deer. Since Bubba is hungry, he will eat Bambi. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

The story is concise and directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
