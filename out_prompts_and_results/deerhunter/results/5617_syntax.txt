To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is at the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is hungry, but his primary goal is to satisfy his greed by obtaining money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and return to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to have a safe place to go after committing the theft.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger after the stressful events.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger and make use of the resources available to him.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba needs money, and the clerk has it. Using the rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.
- **go**: Bubba needs to leave the bank after the theft to avoid being caught.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba is hungry and needs to address this need.
- **eat**: Consuming Bambi allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger.
