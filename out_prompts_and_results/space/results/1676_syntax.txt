Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano and the need to establish a friendship with the Lizard, decides to take action. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the importance of cooperation for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave to find a safer location away from the volcano. This action is necessary to avoid the imminent danger of the eruption.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now feeling more comfortable with Zoe after their peaceful interaction, follows her to the cave. This action reinforces their new friendship and ensures they are both safe from the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from harm. This event highlights the importance of their friendship and cooperation in ensuring their safety.

By making peace first, Zoe successfully establishes a friendship with the Lizard, which allows them both to escape the danger of the volcano together.
