To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can obtain from the bank clerk. Therefore, the next steps will involve Bubba eating Bambi and then going to the bank to confront the clerk for the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and possibly think more clearly about his next steps.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings him closer to his goal of obtaining money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the clerk using the rifle. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the clerk for money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Acquires money from the clerk, achieving Bubba's goal.
