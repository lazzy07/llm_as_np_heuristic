To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room where Casey is currently located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the item they have (I2) to Alex. This is necessary because Alex wants I1, and Casey needs to be willing to give away their item to help Alex.

3. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room with the item they just received. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps in the narrative flow.

4. **put_down(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex puts down the item (I2) in the living room. This action is not necessary for achieving Alex's goal but serves to show that Alex is now satisfied with their situation.

5. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room to check on Alex and Casey. This action is included to show Blake's concern for Alex's happiness.

6. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the item they have (I2) to Blake. This action is included to show that Alex is willing to share their happiness with Blake.

7. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R12)**: Blake trades the item they have (I1) with Casey for the item they want (I2). This action is included to show that Blake is also trying to help Casey achieve their happiness.

8. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room to be with Alex and Blake. This action is included to show that all characters are now together.

9. **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the item they have (I3) to Casey. This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy.

10. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the item they have (I2) to Alex. This action is included to ensure that Alex is happy.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the item they want (I1), and thus achieves their goal of happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R21, R12)",
    "give(C2, I2, C1, R12)",
    "move(C1, R12, R21)",
    "put_down(C1, I2, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R12)",
    "give(C1, I1, C3, R12)",
    "trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R21)",
    "give(C3, I3, C2, R21)",
    "give(C2, I2, C1, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is designed to ensure that Alex ultimately receives the item they want, leading to their happiness.
