To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Ross's condition will help Hathaway decide on the appropriate treatment for him.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Jarkis (which is indicated by a rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross's health, which indirectly supports Jones's goal since all patients need to be healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is important because it ensures that all patients are evaluated and treated, contributing to the overall health of the hospital environment.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients, including Jones, are treated properly, leading to their health and survival.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```
