Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. The clerk has 1 money, which Bubba desires. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to hand over the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Deciding to steal the money**: This is a necessary action because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk is the only character with money available. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, which is what he desires.

After these actions, Bubba will have achieved his goal of having 1 money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
