To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army travels from the USA to Tanis to confront the situation and claim the Ark. This action is necessary because the US Army needs to be present at the location where the Ark is currently held.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, Tanis)**: The US Army takes the Ark from Indiana Jones by force. This action is justified because the US Army is armed and needs to secure the Ark for their own purposes, ensuring that it does not fall into the wrong hands again.

3. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: The US Army takes the Ark from the Nazis, who are now dead after their attempt to open it. This action is necessary to ensure that the Ark is safely in the hands of the US Army and that the Nazis cannot use it for their own immortality.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the US Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead due to their failed attempt to open the dangerous Ark.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)",
    "take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, Tanis)",
    "take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential to ensure the US Army secures the Ark while eliminating the threat posed by the Nazis.
