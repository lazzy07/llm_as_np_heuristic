To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, assesses and treats both patients, Ross and Jones, correctly so that they both become healthy. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can still assess and treat both patients without making a mistake.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the goal:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.
2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
3. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in Admissions to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.
4. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway treats Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that both patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's condition and determine the correct treatment.
- **Treat Ross**: This action is essential to ensure Ross's health, as treating him with the correct medication will make him healthy.
- **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary to identify Jones's condition and determine the correct treatment.
- **Treat Jones**: This action is essential to ensure Jones's health, as treating him with the correct medication will make him healthy.
