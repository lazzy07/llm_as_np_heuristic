To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will result in a character dying. The Lizard, as the guardian of the planet, is likely to be affected by the eruption, and Zoe's actions will ultimately lead to this outcome.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will unfold:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the surface where the volcano is located, which is crucial for the eruption to affect her.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger on the surface.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important as it allows Zoe to interact with the Lizard and potentially resolve their relationship.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace. This action is crucial as it transforms their relationship from adversarial to friendly, aligning with both characters' goals of making friends.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

6. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard dies as a result of the eruption. This action concludes the story with a character dying, fulfilling the requirement of the ending.

In summary, the actions taken lead to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and the establishment of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the eruption occurs. The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that both characters achieve their goals while also leading to the required ending.
