Ernest, aware of the bully's threat, decides to take a calculated risk. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. He quickly moves to the kitchen, where he can grab the knife without being seen by the bully. Once he has the knife, he can confront the bully in the gym, where he knows the bully is currently occupied. 

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen**: This action is necessary for Ernest to obtain the knife, which is crucial for his safety and to confront the bully.
2. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen**: This action allows Ernest to arm himself, giving him a chance to defend against the bully's threats.
3. **Ernest moves to the gym**: This action is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully directly.
4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife**: This action ensures that the threat to both Ernest and Roy is eliminated, allowing them to be safe.

With the bully dead, Ernest can now focus on escaping with Roy, ensuring both of their survival.
