To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coins he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Market with coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that she has the coins stored safely, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial for the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to engage in more dangerous actions, as Tom is unarmed and vulnerable.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
