As day one continues, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows that the bully is in the gym and is currently locked in. 

1. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** This action is crucial because it allows Roy to disguise himself, making it easier for him to escape later without being recognized as a prisoner.

2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** This action is necessary for Roy to leave the prison without being seen by the guards or the bully. The highway is the only way out.

3. **Roy escapes from the prison.** This is the final action that achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free. By escaping, he ensures that he is no longer threatened by the bully or the prison environment.
