After eating Bambi in the forest, Bubba feels a surge of greed for money. He decides to go back to the bank to steal from the bank clerk, who is still there with some money. 

Bubba goes to the bank, where he can confront the clerk. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk without any resistance.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the clerk and steals the money.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where the money is, and the second action enables him to take the money from the clerk.
