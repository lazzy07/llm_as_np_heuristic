To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is necessary to shift their relationship from negative to positive, allowing them to become friends. Since they are currently not fighting, this action can be taken without any conflict.

2. **Zoe walks to the cave**: After making peace, Zoe can walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe and the Lizard together in the same location, reinforcing their new friendship.

3. **The volcano erupts**: This action will cause the volcano to erupt, which is a critical part of the story's conclusion. Since Zoe is now in the cave with the Lizard, the eruption will lead to the death of one character.

4. **The Lizard dies**: The eruption will result in the Lizard's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story.

The final sequence of actions is as follows:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe moves to the cave to be with the Lizard.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the consequences of the story.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- **make_peace**: This is essential for achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.
- **walk**: This action is necessary to bring Zoe and the Lizard together in the cave, reinforcing their friendship.
- **erupt**: This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting and results in the Lizard's death.
