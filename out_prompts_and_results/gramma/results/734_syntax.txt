To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market, where the Guard is located. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to avoid confrontation with the Guard while still being able to interact with the Merchant.

2. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit's location to the Guard. This action helps the Merchant by drawing the Guard's attention to the Bandit, which could lead to the Bandit's capture or death, allowing the Merchant to operate freely.

3. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Market)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit in the Market. This action is crucial as it eliminates the Bandit, who is a criminal and poses a threat to the Merchant's business.

4. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Market)**: After the Bandit is killed, the Merchant will loot the Bandit for any coins she may have. This action directly contributes to the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: Finally, the Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Merchant to return to her preferred location after successfully acquiring coins.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity herself.
