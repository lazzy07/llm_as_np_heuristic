To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, is hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is also present and has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money, and the clerk has it.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will go to the forest to find Bambi, who is dead, to eat. This action is necessary because he needs to find food.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary to complete his goal of eating.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba needs money, and the clerk has it. Using the rifle, he can take the money from the clerk.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba is hungry and needs to acknowledge that he wants to eat.
- **go**: Bubba needs to move to the forest where Bambi is located to find food.
- **eat**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
