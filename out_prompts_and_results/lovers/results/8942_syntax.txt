To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Alex, who is currently in the dining room and has the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the dining room (R12). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have given away the jewelry they wanted to Casey.
- Casey is happy because they received the jewelry they wanted.
- Blake remains unhappy, but the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.
