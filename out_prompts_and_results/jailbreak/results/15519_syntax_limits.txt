After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes. Roy sneaks into the hallway and moves towards the gym, where he locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. 

Meanwhile, Ernest, who is in the hallway, sees an opportunity. He knows that Roy has the cigarettes and that the bully is now locked in the gym. Ernest quickly crawls through the vents to the gym, where he finds Roy and the bully. With the knife he stole earlier, Ernest confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he kills the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened.
