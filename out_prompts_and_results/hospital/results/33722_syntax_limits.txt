**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Fever, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C. Since Young is already assigned to this room, Hathaway can check for symptoms. Young has a fever, which indicates that they may have Flaze.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomC**: After assessing Young and determining that they have Flaze, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, and as a result, Young becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions**: Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to assess and admit the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are still waiting.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Young**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine the correct diagnosis and treatment for Young. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.
  
- **Treating Young**: This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition. By administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze), Hathaway ensures that Young becomes healthy, which is the primary goal.

- **Walking to Admissions**: This action allows Hathaway to move to the Admissions room to potentially assess and treat Jones and Ross, ensuring that all patients are attended to and healthy.
