**Story Completion:**

The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the market with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the market to the crossroads, where she believes the hero is. However, she knows that the guard is also at the market and could pose a threat. 

1. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads. (This action is necessary for the bandit to reposition herself and potentially ambush the hero.)
2. The bandit then walks back to the market, where she sees the merchant. (This action allows her to confront the merchant directly.)
3. The bandit uses her sword to attack the merchant, killing her and taking the medicine. (This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring the medicine and potentially gaining coins from the merchant.)

With the merchant dead, the bandit now has the medicine and can return to her camp, satisfied with her haul.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of walking to the crossroads is to create a diversion and assess the situation, even though the hero is not there.
- The second action of returning to the market is to confront the merchant directly, as she is the only one with the medicine.
- The final action of attacking the merchant is the decisive move that allows the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring the medicine.
