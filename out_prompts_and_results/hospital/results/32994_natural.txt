**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Young is experiencing a fever, decides to treat Young for Flaze. Since Young is in Patient Room A, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy as a result of the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess the other two patients, Jones and Ross. Since both are still in Admissions and their symptoms are unknown, Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B and Ross to Patient Room C. 

After admitting them, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Since Jones's symptoms are still unknown, Hathaway cannot treat him yet. However, Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room C. If Ross is also experiencing a rash, he would be treated for Jarkis with steroids. 

Assuming Ross has a rash, Hathaway treats him with steroids, and Ross becomes healthy as well. 

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: This is necessary because Young has a fever, which indicates Flaze. Treating him correctly ensures he becomes healthy.
2. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to assess the other patients, so moving to Admissions is essential.
3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure Jones is assigned to an exam room for assessment.
4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Similar to Jones, Ross needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment.
5. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: This is necessary to determine Jones's condition, even if it remains unknown.
6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: This is necessary to determine Ross's condition and treat him if he has Jarkis.
7. **Treat Ross with steroids**: If Ross has a rash, this treatment is necessary for him to become healthy.
