To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to communicate and potentially trade items.

2. **tell(C2, C1, I1, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the flowers. This is a strategic move to inform Alex about Casey's desire, which may influence Alex's actions.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room to join Alex and Casey. This is important for Blake to be involved in the exchange of items.

4. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I2, R12)**: Alex trades the flowers (I1) with Blake for the chocolates (I2). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is what they want to be happy.

5. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room where Blake and Casey are. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the other characters after the trade.

6. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action ensures that Casey receives the item they want, which is the flowers, making both Alex and Casey happy.

After these actions, Alex has the flowers, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
