To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to acquire the flowers that Alex wants. Since the flowers are in the living room, Blake can pick them up.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to fulfill Alex's desire for the flowers, which is essential for Alex's happiness.

3. **Alex is now happy.**  
   - After receiving the flowers, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

The actions are designed to ensure that Alex gets what they want (the flowers) while also considering Blake's and Casey's desires, but the focus is on Alex's happiness.
