Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the ground tremble beneath her feet as the volcano begins to erupt. She knows she needs to act quickly to ensure both her safety and that of the Lizard. Despite the danger, she feels a connection with the Lizard and wants to solidify their friendship.

To achieve this, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goals of health and safety. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's sincerity, agrees to become friends.

This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures that they can work together to find safety from the erupting volcano. By making peace, they can focus on escaping the danger rather than fighting each other.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to find a safe location away from the volcano, ensuring their health and safety.
