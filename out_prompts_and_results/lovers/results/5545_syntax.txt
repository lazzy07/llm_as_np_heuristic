To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers (I1)** in the dining room (R12). This is a lie, but it will prompt Casey to act.
2. **Casey picks up the chocolates (I2)** in the dining room (R12). This is a necessary step for Casey to have something to trade.
3. **Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake** in the dining room (R12). This action is to facilitate a trade.
4. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey** in the dining room (R12). This is the final step that ensures Casey receives the item they want.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Action 1 (tell)**: Blake lies to Casey about what Alex wants, which creates a distraction and encourages Casey to take action.
- **Action 2 (pick_up)**: Casey needs to have an item to trade, so picking up the chocolates is essential.
- **Action 3 (give)**: By giving the chocolates to Blake, Casey is setting up for a trade that will lead to their happiness.
- **Action 4 (give)**: This is the crucial action where Casey finally receives the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

Now, here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(Blake, Casey, I1, R12)",
    "pick_up(Casey, I2, R12)",
    "give(Casey, I2, Blake, R12)",
    "give(Blake, I3, Casey, R12)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by receiving the jewelry they desire.
