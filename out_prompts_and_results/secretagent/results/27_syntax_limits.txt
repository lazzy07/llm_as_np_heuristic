The Secret Agent is currently in the Office, holding both the Papers and the Gun. The goal is to eliminate the Mastermind, who is also in the Office. Since the Secret Agent has the Gun, they can directly kill the Mastermind.

**Action:**
- kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because the Secret Agent's goal is to ensure the Mastermind is dead. Since both characters are in the same location (the Office), and the Secret Agent possesses the Gun, this action directly fulfills the Secret Agent's objective.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)"]
}
