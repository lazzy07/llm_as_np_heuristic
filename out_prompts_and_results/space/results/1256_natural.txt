Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the ongoing eruptions. To ensure their safety and health, they decide to take action together.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Since she is currently at the surface, teleporting to the spaceship will protect her from the danger.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard, recognizing the danger of the surface, decides to retreat to the cave, which is a safer location. This action ensures that the Lizard is also safe from the eruptions.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action is crucial for Zoe to be with her friend and to continue building their friendship in a safe environment.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they remain allies, which is important for their mutual goal of safety and health.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
