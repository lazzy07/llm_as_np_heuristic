To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to leave the market and head to the cottage. Since he is currently at the market with the medicine, he can simply walk to the cottage.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to leave the market, where he currently is, and head directly to the cottage, which is his desired location. Since he is already carrying the medicine, he will arrive at the cottage with it.

This is the only necessary action for Tom to achieve his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
