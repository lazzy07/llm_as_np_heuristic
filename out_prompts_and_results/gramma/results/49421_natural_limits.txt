The bandit, armed with her sword and holding the medicine, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is armed, she decides to take a risk. The bandit approaches the hero and, with a swift motion, she attacks the hero, aiming to eliminate him and secure her position. 

The bandit successfully attacks the hero, killing him. With the hero out of the way, she can now safely loot the hero's sword and any coins he may have had. However, since the hero had no coins, she only takes the sword. 

Now, with the hero dead and the market clear of threats, the bandit can return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and the sword, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the hero**: The bandit attacks the hero to eliminate him as a threat. This action is necessary for her to secure her position and ensure she can keep the medicine without interference.
2. **Loot the hero**: After successfully killing the hero, the bandit loots the hero's sword. This action is not strictly necessary for her goal of having coins, but it adds to her arsenal and ensures she is better equipped for future encounters.
