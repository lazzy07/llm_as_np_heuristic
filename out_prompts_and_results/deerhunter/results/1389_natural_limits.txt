Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He points the rifle at the bank clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money he has. Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is taken instead of shooting, as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal without unnecessary violence.
