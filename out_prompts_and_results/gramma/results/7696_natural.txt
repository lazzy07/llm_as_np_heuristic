**Story Completion:**

The bandit, having successfully looted the medicine from the hero, decides to take further advantage of the situation. She approaches the merchant, who is still at the market, and threatens her with her sword. The merchant, unarmed and frightened, hands over the hero's coin to the bandit to avoid any conflict. 

With the coin now in her possession, the bandit feels accomplished. She returns to the bandit camp, where she places the newly acquired coin in the chest alongside her other coins. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Bandit threatens the merchant:** This action is necessary for the bandit to intimidate the merchant into giving her the hero's coin without a fight, as the merchant is unarmed and cannot defend herself.
   
2. **Merchant hands over the hero's coin:** The merchant complies to avoid conflict, allowing the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring more coins.

3. **Bandit walks back to the bandit camp:** This action is essential for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest at her camp, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as possible.
