In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the chocolates (I3). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake achieving their goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R21) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the chocolates, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the chocolates they wanted.
- Blake is happy because they have helped Alex achieve happiness.
