To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the flowers.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers. This action is important because it communicates Alex's desire to Casey, who may be able to help.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21). This action is necessary for Casey to access the flowers that are in the living room.

4. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers from the living room (R21). This is crucial because it allows Casey to have the flowers that Alex wants.

5. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12) with the flowers. This is necessary for Casey to give the flowers to Alex.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the dining room (R12). This action fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
