To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room B with Jones, the first action is to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should walk to Exam Room C to assess Young. This is important to ensure that Young's condition is also understood and treated appropriately.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross. This is crucial as Ross is currently unassigned to an exam room, and understanding his symptoms will allow for proper treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on Young's symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young also becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients effectively, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is crucial to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
