**Story Completion:**

After walking back to the admissions room, Hathaway decides to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in the admissions room. Since Ross has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway can determine his symptoms. 
2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in the admissions room to check for any symptoms. 
3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing both patients, Hathaway admits Ross to exam room B, where he can be treated based on his symptoms.
