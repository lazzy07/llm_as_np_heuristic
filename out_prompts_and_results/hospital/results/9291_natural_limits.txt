Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, decides to admit Jones and Ross to the exam rooms to assess their conditions. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment. It increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is essential to start the treatment process.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to have all patients assigned to exam rooms. It also increases the workload to 4, which means there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosis.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is in Patient Room B. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze due to the increased workload.
