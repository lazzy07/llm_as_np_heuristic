To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is at the bank, has a loaded rifle, and the clerk has money that Bubba desires.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will take the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's greed and achieve the goal of him having the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by moving Bubba away from the scene of the crime.

The story can be summarized as follows:

Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, enters the bank with a loaded rifle. He sees the bank clerk and, without hesitation, shoots him to take the money. After ensuring the clerk is dead, Bubba steals the money and then decides to leave the bank, heading back to the forest.
