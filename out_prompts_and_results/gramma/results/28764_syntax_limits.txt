In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where she can see both Tom and the Merchant. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coin that Tom had just bought from her. This action is possible because the Bandit is armed with a sword, and the Merchant is not armed (as she is not carrying a sword). By taking the coin, the Bandit increases her wealth without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the law, as she is simply taking what is rightfully hers from the Merchant.

After this action, the Bandit will have the coin she desired, achieving her goal of carrying more coins.
