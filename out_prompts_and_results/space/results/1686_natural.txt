4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can work together to escape the eruption.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure their safety from the eruption. Since they are now friends, they can cooperate to escape the danger together.
