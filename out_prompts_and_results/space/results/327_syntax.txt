To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to make peace and become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe walks from the Surface to the Cave.** This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safe place to strategize and potentially communicate with the Lizard, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano.

2. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** Zoe returns to the surface to confront the Lizard and attempt to make peace, as she believes they need to resolve their differences before the volcano erupts.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard on the Surface.** This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship and safety.

4. **The volcano erupts on the Surface.** This event is triggered after the characters have made peace, leading to the death of one character. Since both characters are on the surface, they are both in danger.

5. **Zoe dies due to the eruption.** This is the final outcome of the story, where despite their newfound friendship, the eruption results in Zoe's demise.

The sequence of actions ensures that the story meets the criteria of having the volcano erupt and a character dying, while also allowing for the characters to make peace.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)",
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe needs to move to a safer location to think and plan her next steps.
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe returns to confront the Lizard and attempt to resolve their conflict.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, aligning with their goals of safety and friendship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation for both characters.
- **kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)**: Zoe dies as a result of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story. 

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome while maintaining the integrity of the characters' goals and the story's setting.
