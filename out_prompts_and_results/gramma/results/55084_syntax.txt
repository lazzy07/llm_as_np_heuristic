To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had previously robbed from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without needing to leave the Market.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will take the coin from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first robbing the Merchant to gain a coin and then taking the coin from the chest at the camp.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant to take the coin that Tom had previously taken from her. This is a strategic move to increase her coin count without engaging in a fight.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit then takes the coin from the chest at the bandit camp. This ensures that she has coins stored in the chest, which is one of her goals.

The Bandit now has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
