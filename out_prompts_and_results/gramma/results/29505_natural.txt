The bandit, having just attacked the hero, sees an opportunity to further her goal of acquiring coins. She knows that the merchant has the medicine, which she can use to her advantage. 

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to approach the merchant, who is at the market with the medicine.

2. **The bandit attacks the merchant.**  
   - The bandit is armed and the merchant is not armed, making this a viable action. By attacking the merchant, the bandit can take the medicine and potentially any coins the merchant has.

3. **The bandit loots the item from the corpse of the merchant.**  
   - After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit can loot the medicine from the merchant's corpse. This action helps the bandit achieve her goal of having valuable items.

4. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - With the medicine in hand, the bandit returns to her camp, where she can store her loot and keep the medicine safe.

5. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has secured the medicine, which is a valuable item, and she can now focus on acquiring more coins in the future.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the merchant, as this is where the merchant is located with the medicine.
- Attacking the merchant is a strategic move since the merchant is unarmed, allowing the bandit to take the medicine without risk.
- Looting the merchant's corpse ensures that the bandit successfully acquires the medicine, which is part of her goal.
- Returning to the bandit camp allows the bandit to secure her loot and prepare for future actions.
- Finally, placing the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp solidifies her success in achieving her goal of having valuable items.
