To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to have the flowers to eventually give them to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to fulfill Alex's wish for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still unhappy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is happy because they have given the flowers to Alex.

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
