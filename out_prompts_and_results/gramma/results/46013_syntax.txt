To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where Tom and the Merchant are located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to interact with Tom to achieve her goal.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coin he has. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads after robbing Tom. This is necessary to position herself for the next action.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit walks to the Market to confront Tom and rob him.
- The Bandit robs Tom to gain a coin, which is essential for her goal.
- The Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to prepare for the next step.
- Finally, the Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the camp, ensuring she has coins as per her goal.
