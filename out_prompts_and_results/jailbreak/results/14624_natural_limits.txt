**Story Completion:**

Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knows that the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is threatened in the cell block. To ensure both their safety and to achieve his goal of escaping, Roy decides to take action. He sneaks through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where the bully is currently located. 

Once in the gym, Roy locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. With the bully unable to escape, Roy then takes out the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen and confronts the bully. In a swift move, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy returns to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes, and makes his way to the highway. There, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
