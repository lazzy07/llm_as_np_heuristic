To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has loaded a rifle. The bank clerk is at the bank with some money, and Bambi is also in the forest. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi, which is a deer. This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat. By shooting Bambi, he can obtain food.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action satisfies his hunger, which is a priority for him.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while he has the loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- Shooting Bambi allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is important for his survival and well-being.
- Eating Bambi ensures that Bubba is no longer hungry, allowing him to focus on his goal of getting money.
- Going to the bank is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and take the money.
- Stealing from the clerk is the final action that fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
