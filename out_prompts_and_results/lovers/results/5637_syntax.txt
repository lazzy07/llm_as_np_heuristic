To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially trade or give items.

2. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to have the item they want, which is the jewelry.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R21) after receiving the jewelry from Alex. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Casey to potentially interact with Blake later.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the bathroom (R12) to check on Alex and Casey. This action is included to maintain the connection between characters and their interactions.

5. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy, as they want Blake to be happy.

6. **give(C3, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I3) to Alex. This action is included to ensure that Alex is happy, as they want Casey to be happy, and it also fulfills Blake's desire to make Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, fulfilling their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: This keeps the story moving and allows for further interactions.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake's movement keeps the characters connected and allows for future interactions.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: This ensures Casey's happiness, which is part of Alex's goal of wanting Casey to be happy.
