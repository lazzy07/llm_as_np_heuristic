To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and has a desire for money. He will go to the Bank where the Clerk is located, as he believes the Clerk has money. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the Clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use his loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action will result in the Clerk being killed, allowing Bubba to take the money without any resistance. This action directly fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

By executing these two actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the Clerk and attempt to acquire the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the Clerk and take the money, fulfilling the story's goal.
