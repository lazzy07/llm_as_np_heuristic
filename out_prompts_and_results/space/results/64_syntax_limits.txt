Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the ground tremble beneath her feet as the volcano begins to erupt. She knows she must act quickly to ensure her safety and that of the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Despite the danger, she feels a connection with the Lizard and wants to make friends.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action has already occurred, indicating that the volcano is starting to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both Zoe and the Lizard.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - This action has already occurred, establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. They both want to be healthy and safe, and this action solidifies their relationship, allowing them to work together.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - Zoe decides to walk to the cave, seeking shelter from the impending eruption. This action is necessary for her safety as the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)** - The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, recognizing the danger of the erupting volcano. This action shows that the Lizard is also prioritizing safety and is willing to join Zoe.

5. **erupt(Surface)** - The volcano erupts, but both Zoe and the Lizard are safe inside the cave. This action concludes the story with the eruption, while both characters have successfully made friends and avoided danger.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends while also addressing the immediate danger posed by the erupting volcano. The story ends with the eruption, but both characters are safe.
