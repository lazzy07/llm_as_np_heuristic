**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to his high workload. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, he survives the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross. Upon assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway finds that he is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is correct for Flaze, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway, still under the pressure of a high workload, mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young, however, is actually healthy and survives the treatment.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
