**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, as knowing the correct diagnosis is crucial for treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze. This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in the admissions room to check for symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment as well.

4. **Treat Young**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy, contributing to Hathaway's goal.
