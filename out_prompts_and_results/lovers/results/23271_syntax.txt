To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, here’s a concise story that leads to that outcome:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21)**: This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and it is currently in the same room as Casey.

2. **Blake tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I3)**: This action is included to create a scenario where Casey believes that Blake wants the jewelry, which may influence Casey's next actions.

3. **Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake**: This action is necessary for Casey to fulfill Blake's desire, which in turn will make Casey happy as they want Blake to be happy.

4. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey**: This action allows Casey to finally receive the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **Casey is now happy**: Since Casey has received the jewelry, they are now happy.

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Casey needs to pick up the jewelry to have it in their possession.
- **tell(C2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake's statement influences Casey's perception of what Blake wants, which is important for the next action.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R21)**: By giving the jewelry to Blake, Casey is acting on the belief that this will make Blake happy.
- **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake reciprocates by giving the jewelry back to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:
