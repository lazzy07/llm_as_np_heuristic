**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take action. He knows that Ernest is threatened by the bully and that they need to escape. 

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from coming out and threatening them. This action is crucial because it secures their immediate safety and gives Roy time to plan their next move without the bully's interference.

2. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is necessary for him to escape the prison without being detected by the guards or the bully.

3. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Once on the highway, Roy takes off his disguise and escapes from the prison. This is the final action that allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **lock_gym**: This action is taken to ensure that the bully cannot threaten either Roy or Ernest while they plan their escape.
- **vent**: Crawling through the vents is a stealthy way to bypass the prison's security and reach the outside world.
- **escape**: This is the ultimate goal for Roy, allowing him to leave the prison and be free from threats.
