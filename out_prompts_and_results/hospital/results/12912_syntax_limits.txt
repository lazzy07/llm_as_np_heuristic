In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in exam room C with Ross, who is showing symptoms of SymptomA. Jones and Young are in the admissions room, with Jones also showing symptoms of SymptomA and Young showing symptoms of SymptomB. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to treat Ross and then admit and assess Jones.

1. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for SymptomA (Flaze). This action is crucial because it directly addresses Ross's health issue, ensuring he becomes healthy.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomA)**: After treating Ross, Hathaway admits Jones to exam room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated for his symptoms, which will help him become healthy as well.

By performing these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Ross and sets up Jones for treatment, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
