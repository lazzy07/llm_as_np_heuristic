**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Ernest is in the cell block and that the bully is in the gym. Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison safely. 

Roy crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he knows the bully is. Once inside the gym, he locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening them further.
