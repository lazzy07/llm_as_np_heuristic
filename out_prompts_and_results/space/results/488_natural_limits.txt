Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially help the Lizard. She teleports from the cave to the surface, where she sees the Lizard struggling with the volcanic activity. Instead of attacking or stunning the Lizard, Zoe chooses to make peace, recognizing that they both want to be healthy and safe. The Lizard, surprised by Zoe's gesture, reciprocates, and they become friends. 

However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts violently, causing a massive explosion. Zoe, in a moment of bravery, pushes the Lizard out of harm's way but is caught in the eruption herself. The Lizard, now a friend, mourns the loss of Zoe but understands that they both wanted the same thing: safety and friendship.
