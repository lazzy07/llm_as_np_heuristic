In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are all present. Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Vince, who is at the cave. After Vince is eaten, Gargax finds the money that Vince had. Talia, now realizing that she has lost her other husband, Rory, proposes to Rory, who accepts. This leads to Talia becoming happy because she is now married to Rory.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because it eliminates one of the humans, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Rory without the distraction of Vince's presence. It also allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger.
2. **Talia proposes to Rory**: After the chaos of losing Vince, Talia takes the initiative to propose to Rory, which is a direct action towards her goal of happiness.
3. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal**: This action is crucial as it leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling her desire to be happy.

The story is kept short by focusing on the essential actions that lead to Talia's happiness without unnecessary complications.
