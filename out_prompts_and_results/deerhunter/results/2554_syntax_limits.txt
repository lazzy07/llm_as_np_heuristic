To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: After arriving at the bank, Bubba decides to shoot Bambi, who is also in the forest. This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and may want to eat Bambi, and it also fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead.

By executing these two actions, we ensure that Bubba either has the money (if he decides to steal it from the clerk after shooting Bambi) or that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the bank where he can confront the clerk and potentially steal money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to kill Bambi, satisfying the condition of having Bambi dead, and it also aligns with Bubba's hunger.
