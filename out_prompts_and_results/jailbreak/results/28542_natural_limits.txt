**Story Completion:**

Roy, after completing his chores in the kitchen, decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is locked in the gym and that Ernest is still in the cells, threatened by the bully. Roy has the knife and the civilian clothes, which he can use to help both himself and Ernest. 

Roy quickly moves to the hallway, where he puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This will allow him to move freely without being recognized. He then crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside the gym, he finds the bully, who is unaware of Roy's presence. 

With the knife in hand, Roy confronts the bully and, in a swift motion, kills him. This act not only eliminates the threat to both himself and Ernest but also allows Roy to feel a sense of power and control in a place where he has felt threatened.
