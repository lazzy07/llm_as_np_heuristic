Bubba, feeling hungry after shooting Bambi, decides to eat the deer. After consuming Bambi, he feels satisfied and realizes he still needs money. He then decides to go to the bank to confront the clerk. 

At the bank, Bubba sees the clerk and, believing he can intimidate him, he pulls out the rifle (which he still has) and demands the clerk's money. The clerk, believing Bubba is dangerous with the rifle, hands over his money to avoid confrontation. Bubba now has the money he wanted.
