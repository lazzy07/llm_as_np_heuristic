Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, and they share a mutual desire to be healthy and safe while also wanting to make friends. 

To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship, which is orbiting the planet. However, this action makes the Lizard angry, as it feels abandoned. Realizing the potential danger of the surface, Zoe quickly reassesses her decision. Instead of leaving, she suggests they both walk to the cave, a safer location where they can continue to build their friendship away from the dangers of the surface.

In the cave, they can discuss their goals and establish a stronger bond, ensuring that both Zoe and the Lizard feel safe and healthy. 

The actions taken are:
1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)** - This action is included to show Zoe's initial instinct to prioritize her safety by returning to the ship, even though it angers the Lizard.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - This action is included to demonstrate Zoe's realization that they need to work together and find a safer place, thus fostering their friendship.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - This action solidifies their friendship in a safe environment, ensuring both characters achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
