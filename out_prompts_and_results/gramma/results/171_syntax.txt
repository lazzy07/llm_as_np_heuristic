To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will leave the Bandit Camp and walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for her to interact with Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom using the coin she has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin without committing a crime, thus achieving her goal.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: After the transaction, the Merchant will return to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for her to be back at her preferred location.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired a coin without engaging in any criminal activity, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- The second action is crucial as it directly contributes to the Merchant's goal of acquiring coins legally.
- The final action returns the Merchant to her preferred location, maintaining her status as a non-criminal.
