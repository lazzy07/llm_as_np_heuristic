The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is present. The bandit knows that the guard is focused on the dead merchant and does not suspect her. 

Once at the market, the bandit attacks the guard, who is not armed with a sword, and kills him. With the guard out of the way, the bandit loots the guard's sword and takes the coins he was carrying. Now, the bandit has more coins and is able to return to her camp, where she can store her newfound wealth.
