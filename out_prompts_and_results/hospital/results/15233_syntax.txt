To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross** in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms.
2. **Assess Young** in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms.
3. **Assess Jones** in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms.
4. **Treat Ross** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
5. **Treat Young** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
6. **Treat Jones** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

### Explanation of Actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to identify whether he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This is crucial to determine the correct treatment.
   
2. **Assess Young**: Similarly, Hathaway must assess Young to find out his symptoms. This will help in deciding the right treatment for him as well.

3. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway must assess Jones to understand his condition. Since Jones is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway needs to check his symptoms to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will then treat Young based on the assessment results. The same logic applies here as with Ross.

6. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. 

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly, thus achieving the goal of making them healthy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway assesses and treats each patient correctly, leading to their health and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
