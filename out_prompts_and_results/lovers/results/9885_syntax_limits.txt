In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I3 (the item currently held by Casey). 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex directly.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the item I3 (which is currently held by Casey) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the item they wanted (I3).
- Blake is also happy because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy.

The story is complete with just these two actions, as they directly lead to Blake's happiness through Alex's happiness.
