Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship for safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, teleports to the surface to confront Zoe. 

Once on the surface, the Lizard and Zoe find themselves in a tense standoff. The volcano begins to rumble ominously, and Zoe, understanding the urgency of the situation, suggests they work together to escape the danger. The Lizard, initially hesitant, recognizes that Zoe's intentions are not hostile and agrees to make peace.

As they talk, the volcano erupts, sending lava flows towards them. In a moment of teamwork, Zoe and the Lizard help each other find a safe path to the cave. They manage to escape just in time, solidifying their newfound friendship.
