**Story Completion:**

Alex is in the dining room, holding the jewelry. Knowing that they want the flowers, Alex decides to take action. 

1. **Alex moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Alex to reach the flowers, which are located in the living room.

2. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is the flowers.

3. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey in the dining room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex to achieve their goal but helps Casey to become happy, which aligns with Alex's desire for Casey's happiness.

Now, Alex has the flowers and is happy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (moving to the living room) is essential for Alex to access the flowers.
- The second action (picking up the flowers) directly fulfills Alex's goal of being happy.
- The third action (giving jewelry to Casey) is included to show Alex's selflessness, but it is not required for Alex's happiness.
