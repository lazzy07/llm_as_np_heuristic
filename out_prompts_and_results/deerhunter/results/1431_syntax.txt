To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary because he needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, and Bambi remains alive since Bubba's actions did not involve Bambi.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
