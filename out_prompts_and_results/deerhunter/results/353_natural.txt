To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has the money but is not in the forest, so Bubba cannot steal it from the clerk directly. However, Bubba can use the rifle to shoot Bambi, which would allow him to eat and potentially satisfy his hunger.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded rifle to shoot Bambi.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to fulfill his hunger by eating Bambi, and it also leads to Bambi being dead.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is one of his goals.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba is no longer hungry, and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Load ammunition into the rifle:** This is essential for Bubba to be able to shoot Bambi.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a secondary goal but important for his character's development.
