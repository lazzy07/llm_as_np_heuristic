In this story, we want to ensure that Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. To do this, we need to ensure that Young is assessed and treated correctly by Dr. Hathaway. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them based on the identified symptoms. If Young has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze; if they have a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Hathaway walks into Exam Room B where Young is located and assesses them. Let's say Young shows symptoms of a rash, indicating Jarkis.
- Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Young becomes healthy.

Now, Young has achieved their goal of being alive and healthy.
