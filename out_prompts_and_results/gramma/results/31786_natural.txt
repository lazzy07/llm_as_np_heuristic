The bandit, having just attacked both the hero and the merchant, now stands at the market with the hero's coin and the merchant's sword. The guard, who is also at the market, is unaware of the bandit's criminal activities. The banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

To achieve this goal, the bandit will take the following actions:

1. **Walk from the market to the bandit camp.** This action is necessary for the bandit to transport the coins she has looted to her safe location, the bandit camp.

2. **Put the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action ensures that the bandit has successfully stored the coin in a secure location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The story unfolds as follows:

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.
2. The bandit puts the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
