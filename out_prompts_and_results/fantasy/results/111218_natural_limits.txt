Talia, who is currently at the cave with Rory and Gargax, realizes that she needs to secure her happiness and wealth. Since she already has the treasure, she decides to take action to ensure her wealth increases. 

**Action: Gargax eats Talia.**

This action is necessary because Gargax, the dragon, is at the cave and is hungry. By eating Talia, Gargax will become wealthy (as he will take the treasure from Talia), and Talia will no longer be alive, which paradoxically fulfills her desire for happiness and wealth in a twisted way. 

After this action, Talia's wealth will be transferred to Gargax, and since Talia is no longer alive, she will not experience hunger or unhappiness. 

**Final Explanation:**
- Gargax eats Talia: This action results in Talia's death, which paradoxically fulfills her goal of being wealthy (as she had the treasure) and happy (as she is no longer alive to feel unhappiness).
