Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, having established a peaceful relationship. However, the surface is dangerous, and both characters want to ensure their safety while also making friends. 

To achieve this, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safer place and to further her relationship with the Lizard.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters are no longer in a state of conflict, which is essential for achieving their goals of safety and friendship.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action is crucial for her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she needs to ensure she is in a secure location.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface. This action allows the Lizard to maintain its role as the guardian of the planet while also ensuring it is safe.

5. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Finally, the Lizard makes peace with Zoe again on the surface. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are aligned in their goals of safety and companionship.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.
