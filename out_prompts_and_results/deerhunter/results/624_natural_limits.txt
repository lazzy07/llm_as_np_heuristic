Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He knows the bank clerk has the money he desires. Since he has the rifle and ammunition, he can use them to intimidate the clerk. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** This action is necessary because it prepares Bubba to use the rifle as a threat, making the clerk more likely to comply with his demands.
   
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now threaten the clerk into giving him the money he wants.

After these actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining 1 money.
