**Story Completion:**

After admitting Young to Exam Room C, Hathaway, who is currently in Exam Room C, decides to assess Young's symptoms. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C to determine if they are showing any symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway believes Young is alive and healthy. 

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing that Young has Flaze, which is a mistake due to the workload. However, since Young is actually healthy, the treatment does not harm them.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Young, now feeling better after the treatment, walks to the Admissions room to check on the other patients, ensuring they are alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Young's condition. Even though there is a risk of misdiagnosis, it is essential for the treatment process.
  
- **Treat Young**: This action is crucial as it represents Hathaway's attempt to help Young. Even though the treatment is incorrect, Young is healthy, so they do not suffer any consequences.

- **Walk to Admissions**: This action allows Young to check on the status of other patients, fulfilling their goal of being alive and healthy while also ensuring the well-being of others.
