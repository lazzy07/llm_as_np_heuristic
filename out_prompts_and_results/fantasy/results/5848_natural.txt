To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who is at the village, will eat Vince, who is also at the village. This action is necessary because it allows Gargax to gain wealth (by taking the money Vince had) and also eliminates Vince, who is a competitor for Talia's affections and wealth.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax will take the money from Vince's body. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy, but it also indirectly helps Rory because it removes Vince from the equation, allowing Rory to focus on Talia.

3. **Talia picks up the treasure**: Talia, who is at the cave, will pick up the treasure. This action is necessary for Talia to have something of value, which can help in her relationship with Rory.

4. **Rory proposes to Talia**: Rory, who is at the cave, will propose to Talia. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve happiness, as it allows him to express his feelings and intentions towards Talia.

5. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: Talia will accept Rory's proposal. This action is necessary for both characters to achieve happiness through their union.

6. **Rory and Talia get married**: Rory and Talia will get married. This final action solidifies their relationship and ensures Rory's happiness.

At the end of these actions, Rory will have achieved his goal of being happy, wealthy (through the indirect acquisition of wealth from Gargax), and not hungry (as he is not in a situation where he is hungry).
