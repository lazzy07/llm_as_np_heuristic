Zoe, realizing the danger the Lizard is in on the surface, decides to help. She teleports from the ship to the surface to offer her assistance. Upon arriving, she finds the Lizard and sees that it is in a precarious situation due to the erupting volcano. Instead of fighting, Zoe extends a hand of friendship, and the Lizard, recognizing her intentions, accepts. They both work together to find a safe path away from the volcano, ensuring their safety and forming a bond.
