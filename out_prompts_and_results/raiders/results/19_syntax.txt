To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **take(Nazis, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The Nazis, armed and believing the Ark is with Jones, will take the Ark from Indiana Jones by force. This action is necessary because the Nazis need the Ark to achieve their goal of immortality.

2. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: After taking the Ark, the Nazis will open it. Since the Ark is not dangerous (as indicated), this action will grant them immortality.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is crucial because the Nazis cannot achieve their goal without possessing the Ark. They are armed and can take it from Indiana Jones, who is currently in the same location.
- The second action is essential as it directly leads to the Nazis achieving their goal of immortality. Since the Ark is safe, opening it will not result in death, but rather grant them the immortality they seek.
