To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially find more opportunities to steal or acquire coins.

2. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant leaves the Camp and heads to the Crossroads to meet with Tom and the Bandit.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom of his coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count, but it also indirectly benefits the Merchant by removing Tom from the equation.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market, where she can sell her items or interact with the Guard.

5. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: The Merchant uses the coin she acquired from robbing Tom to buy the medicine from herself. This action allows her to gain an item of value while also ensuring she has not committed a crime.

6. **walk(Merchant, Market, Camp)**: The Merchant returns to the Camp with the medicine, completing her goal of acquiring an item while ensuring she remains within the bounds of legality.
