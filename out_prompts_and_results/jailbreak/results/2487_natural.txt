**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knows he must act quickly to help both himself and Ernest. He decides to sneak through the vents from the hallway to the kitchen, where the knife is located. 

1. **Roy crawls through the vents to the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to obtain the knife, which he needs to confront the bully.)
   
2. **Roy steals the knife from the kitchen.** (Roy needs the knife to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)

3. **Roy crawls back through the vents to the hallway.** (This action allows Roy to return to a safe location with the knife.)

4. **Roy locks the gym door again.** (This ensures that the bully remains trapped inside the gym, preventing him from threatening either Roy or Ernest.)

5. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (Roy needs to confront the bully now that he has the knife.)

6. **Roy kills the bully with the knife in the gym.** (This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)

7. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes in the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to disguise himself for the escape.)

8. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows Roy to reach the highway where he can escape.)

9. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This is the final action that achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at either obtaining the knife to confront the bully or ensuring his own safety and eventual escape. The locking of the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from retaliating while Roy prepares to confront him. The final escape is the culmination of all actions taken to ensure Roy's survival and freedom.
