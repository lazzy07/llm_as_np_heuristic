To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Ross's symptoms to decide on the appropriate treatment. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Similarly, Hathaway must assess Young to understand their symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as with Ross.

3. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment as well. This is also necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating both patients, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Jones.

6. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms, which is necessary to provide the correct treatment.

7. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the assessment. This is the last step to ensure all patients are healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
