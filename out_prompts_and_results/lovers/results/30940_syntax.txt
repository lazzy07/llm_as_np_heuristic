To achieve Blake's goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Blake's Goal**: Blake wants to be happy, which means they need to have the item they want. Since Blake's happiness is not directly stated, we can infer that Blake's happiness is tied to Alex's happiness, which is linked to Alex wanting item I1 (jewelry).

2. **Current Situation**: 
   - Alex (C1) is in R12 and wants I1 (jewelry).
   - Casey (C3) is in R12 and wants I3 (flowers).
   - Blake (C2) is in R12 and has I1 (jewelry) with them.

3. **Actions to Take**:
   - **Trade**: Blake can trade I1 (jewelry) with Casey for I3 (flowers). This will make Casey happy because they will receive the flowers they want, and it will also make Alex happy since they will have the jewelry they desire.

### Story Sequence:
1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R12)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey for the flowers (I3). This action is necessary because it allows both Casey and Alex to be happy. After this trade, Blake will have I3 (flowers), Casey will have I1 (jewelry), and Alex will be happy because they will receive the jewelry they want.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that both Casey and Alex are happy. Since Blake's happiness is indirectly tied to Alex's happiness, by ensuring Alex gets what they want, Blake achieves their goal of being happy as well.
