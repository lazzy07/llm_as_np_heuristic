To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up earlier with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the flowers.

2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: After the trade, Alex will move to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but sets up the next action for Casey.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey (C3) will give the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the same room (R22). This action is necessary to ensure that Alex has the flowers, which is what they want.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, making them happy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Alex trades chocolates for flowers with Casey.
2. Alex moves to the dining room.
3. Casey gives the flowers to Alex.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to exchange the chocolates they have for the flowers they want, directly addressing their goal of happiness.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: While this action does not directly contribute to Alex's happiness, it prepares for the next step where Casey can give Alex the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action ensures that Alex receives the flowers, fulfilling their desire and making them happy. 

By following this sequence, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
