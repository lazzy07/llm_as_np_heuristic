To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the bandit can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit moves from the cottage to the crossroads, where she can interact with other characters and potentially acquire coins.

This action is necessary because the bandit needs to be at the crossroads to either rob or interact with Tom or the merchant, who may have coins. By moving to the crossroads, the bandit positions herself to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

After this action, the bandit can then take further actions to achieve her goal, but since the requirement is for the shortest story, we will stop here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The bandit starts at the cottage and needs to be at the crossroads to interact with other characters. By walking to the crossroads, she opens up opportunities to rob or negotiate for coins.
