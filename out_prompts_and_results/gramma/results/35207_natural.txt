To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage, where he can carry the medicine.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is implied as part of Tom's goal of carrying the medicine. It signifies that he has successfully completed his objective.

The story is very short because Tom's goal is straightforward: he needs to get to the cottage with the medicine. The other characters do not interfere with his goal, and since Tom is not armed, he cannot engage in any conflict.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.",
    "Tom uses the medicine."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom achieves his goal efficiently and without unnecessary complications.
