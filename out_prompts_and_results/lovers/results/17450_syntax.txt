To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom to the bathroom. This is necessary for Alex to be closer to the other characters and items.
2. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bathroom to the dining room. This is where the flowers are located, and Alex needs to be in the same room to pick them up.
3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This is the item Alex wants, and picking it up is essential for their happiness.
4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bathroom. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but allows for potential interactions with other characters.
5. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom. This is where Alex can be alone with the flowers, ensuring they can enjoy their happiness.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, which means they are happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
