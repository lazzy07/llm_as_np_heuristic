**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy decides to check on Ernest. He believes Ernest is still in the hallway, but he is unaware that Ernest has already crawled through the vents to the highway and disguised himself in civilian clothes. 

Meanwhile, Ernest, now on the highway and disguised, feels a sense of relief. He knows he has the pack of cigarettes, which he can use to negotiate his safety. However, he also knows that he must escape before the bully or the guards find him. 

Ernest takes a moment to gather his thoughts and then makes a decisive move. He walks along the highway, looking for an opportunity to escape. He knows that if he can just get far enough away from the prison, he will be safe. 

As he reaches a point where he can see the open road, he takes a deep breath and runs towards freedom. He successfully escapes from the prison, leaving behind the threats and dangers of prison life.
