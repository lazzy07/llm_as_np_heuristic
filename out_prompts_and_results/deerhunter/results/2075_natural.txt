To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential target.

2. **Bubba picks up the rifle.**  
   - This action is included to ensure Bubba has a weapon to intimidate or threaten the bank clerk if needed. However, since Bubba already has the rifle, this action is redundant and can be omitted.

3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba returns to the bank to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

4. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - This action is necessary to prepare the rifle for use, making it a threat to the clerk.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now threaten the clerk and take the money, achieving his goal.
