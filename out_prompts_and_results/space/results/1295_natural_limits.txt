Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano nearby rumbles ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she believes that being on the spaceship will protect her from the imminent threat of the volcano. 

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** The Lizard chooses to walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the surface's dangers. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being safe.

3. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** Although this action makes the Lizard angry, Zoe believes that she can help her new friend and ensure they can both be safe together. 

In this short story, the Lizard achieves its goal of being safe by moving to the cave, while Zoe's actions reflect her desire to help her friend, even if it puts her in danger momentarily.
