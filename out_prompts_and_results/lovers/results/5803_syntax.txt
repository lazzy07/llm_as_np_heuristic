To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This is a lie, as Alex actually wants the chocolates (I2). However, this action is necessary to create a misunderstanding that will lead to a trade.
   
2. **tell(C2, C3, I1, R12)**: Casey, believing Alex, tells Blake that Alex wants the flowers (I1). This reinforces the misunderstanding and sets up the next action.

3. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R12)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) they picked up from the room with Blake for the jewelry (I3). This is the key action that allows Casey to obtain the item they want.

4. **put_down(C2, I1, R12)**: After the trade, Casey puts down the flowers (I1) in the dining room. This action is necessary to reflect that Casey no longer holds the flowers.

5. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the room where the jewelry is located, ensuring they are in the right place to be happy with their new item.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry (I3), making them happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two "tell" actions create a false belief that leads to a trade, which is essential for Casey to get the jewelry.
- The "trade" action is the pivotal moment where Casey achieves their goal by obtaining the jewelry.
- The "put_down" action is necessary to show that Casey no longer has the flowers after the trade.
- The "move" action is included to signify that Casey is now in a position to enjoy their happiness with the jewelry.
