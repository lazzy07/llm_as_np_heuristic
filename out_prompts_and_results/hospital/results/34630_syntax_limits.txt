In this story, we will focus on Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy. Given the current situation, Hathaway has a workload of 3, which means they are at risk of making a mistake. To avoid this, Hathaway should first assess the patients in the exam rooms to determine their symptoms before treating them.

### Story Completion:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, ensuring the correct treatment can be administered.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway moves to Exam Room A to assess Young. This step is necessary to gather information about Young's condition, which is essential for providing the right treatment.

3. **Treat Ross with the Correct Treatment**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is vital to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Ross**: This action is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis due to Hathaway's high workload. It helps Hathaway understand Ross's condition accurately.
- **Assessing Young**: Similar to assessing Ross, this action is needed to gather information about Young's health status, ensuring Hathaway can treat him correctly later.
- **Treating Ross**: This action is the culmination of the assessments. By treating Ross correctly, Hathaway fulfills their goal of ensuring the health of the patients.
