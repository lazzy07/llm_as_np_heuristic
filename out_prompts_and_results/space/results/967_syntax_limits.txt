Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship, while the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is in a cave on the surface. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, but their relationship is currently strained. To achieve her goal of friendship, Zoe decides to teleport to the surface of the planet, where the Lizard is located.

1. **Action: teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)** - Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to approach the Lizard directly. This action is necessary for Zoe to initiate contact and work towards friendship.

2. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)** - Once on the surface, Zoe makes a peace offering to the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety and health. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring safety.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully establishes a friendship with the Lizard, allowing both characters to feel safe and healthy together.
