To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomB with Jones, the first action is to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should walk to PatientRoomA to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms as well, ensuring that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Ross. This is important to determine Ross's symptoms and provide the necessary treatment.

6. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is necessary to identify the correct disease and treatment for each patient.
- **Treating patients**: This is the ultimate goal of Hathaway, to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.
- **Walking between rooms**: This is required to reach each patient and perform assessments and treatments.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment_for_Jones, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_Young, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_Ross, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, the specific treatments for Jones, Young, and Ross would depend on the symptoms assessed, but the actions ensure that Hathaway can achieve their goal of making all patients healthy.
