To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the Forest to the Bank. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the Bank to confront the Clerk and obtain the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the Clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the Clerk into giving him the money. This action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
