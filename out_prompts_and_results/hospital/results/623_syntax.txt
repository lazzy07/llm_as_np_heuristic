To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully assesses and treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room B with Ross**: This will allow Hathaway to assess Ross, who is currently in the admissions room.
2. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will check Ross for symptoms to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis.
3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment to ensure he becomes healthy.
4. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room A with Jones**: This will allow Hathaway to assess Jones, who is currently in the admissions room.
5. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will check Jones for symptoms to determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis.
6. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment to ensure he becomes healthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Ross, ExamRoomB)**: This action is necessary to move Ross from the admissions room to an exam room where he can be assessed.
2. **Assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, ExamRoomB)**: This action is crucial for Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms, which will inform the treatment decision.
3. **Treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, ExamRoomB)**: This action is essential to provide the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified, ensuring Ross's health.
4. **Admit(Hathaway, Jones, ExamRoomA)**: This action allows Hathaway to move on to the next patient, Jones, who also needs assessment and treatment.
5. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, ExamRoomA)**: Similar to Ross, this action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms for proper treatment.
6. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, ExamRoomA)**: This final action ensures that Jones receives the correct treatment based on his symptoms, leading to his recovery.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will successfully assess and treat both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
