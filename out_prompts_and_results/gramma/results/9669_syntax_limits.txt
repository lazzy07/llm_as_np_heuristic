To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. Since he is already at the Crossroads and has the medicine, this action directly fulfills his goal.

This is the only action needed because Tom already possesses the medicine and is in a position to move to his desired location without any obstacles.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it allows Tom to reach the cottage, which is his goal. He is already equipped with the medicine, so there are no additional actions required to achieve his objective.
