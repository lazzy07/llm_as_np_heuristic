In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item they want (I1 - flowers). However, Casey (C3) is not happy because they want the item I3 (jewelry), and Blake (C2) is also not happy because they want the item I2 (chocolates). To ensure Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3) in the room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for happiness by providing them with the item they want (I3 - jewelry). 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will no longer have the flowers (I1) and will be unhappy.
- Casey (C3) will now be happy because they received the flowers (I1), which they wanted.
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy, but Alex's goal of making Casey happy is achieved.

Thus, the story concludes with Alex successfully making Casey happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving the flowers to Casey is the only necessary action to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy. Since Alex already has what they want, they can sacrifice their happiness for the sake of Casey's happiness.
