To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit loots the coin from Tom's corpse. This action is necessary because Tom is dead, and the Bandit can take the coin to increase her wealth.

2. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit loots the sword from the Merchant's corpse. This action is necessary for the Bandit to arm herself, which will help her in future confrontations and solidify her status as a criminal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by looting the coins from Tom and the sword from the Merchant, and then taking the coins from the chest at the camp.
