To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R21)**: Alex (C1) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C2) for the chocolates (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because Alex wants the chocolates to be happy, and Casey wants the jewelry, which Alex has.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I1) and will also be happy since they got what they wanted.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R21)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the chocolates they desire by giving away the jewelry they have. This is the only action needed to ensure Alex's happiness.

Now, here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Alex achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.
