To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will be taken to achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Blake to potentially interact with Alex later.

4. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey also moves back to the dining room (R12). Similar to Blake's action, this keeps the characters in motion and allows for future interactions.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C2, R22, R12)** and **move(C3, R22, R12)**: These actions are not necessary for Alex's happiness but help maintain the flow of the story and keep the characters engaged.
