To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, she will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After picking up the treasure, Talia will travel back to the village. This is necessary for her to interact with Rory and Vince, who are both in the village.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia will marry Rory. Since she has already accepted his proposal, this action will make both of them happy. Talia's happiness is now achieved.

4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia will also marry Vince. Since she has accepted his proposal as well, this action will further increase her happiness.

At this point, Talia has achieved her goals of being happy (through marriage to both Rory and Vince) and wealthy (by picking up the treasure). 

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **pickup**: This action is essential for Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her primary goals.
- **travel**: This action is necessary for Talia to return to the village where she can marry both Rory and Vince.
- **marry**: Marrying Rory and Vince fulfills Talia's desire for happiness, as she is now in a relationship with both of them.
