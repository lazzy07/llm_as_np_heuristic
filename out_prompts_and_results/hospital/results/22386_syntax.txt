To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Since Jones has already been assessed and is showing symptoms of SymptomA, Hathaway needs to treat Jones. After treating Jones, Hathaway can then assess and treat the remaining patients, Ross and Young, to ensure they are also healthy.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze (the disease associated with SymptomA). This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

2. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting to be assigned to an exam room.

3. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Ross to exam room B. This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to a room where he can be assessed and treated.

4. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Young.

5. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Young to exam room C. This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to a room where he can be assessed and treated.

6. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway walks to exam room B to assess Ross.

7. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and finds he has SymptomB (which is associated with Jarkis). This action is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Ross.

8. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

9. **walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks to exam room C to assess Young.

10. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young and finds he has SymptomC (which is also associated with Jarkis). This action is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Young.

11. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are treated correctly and are healthy.
