To complete the story, Tom needs to get the medicine from the merchant while ensuring he can return to the cottage. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will allow Tom to achieve his goal:

1. **walk(Tom, Camp, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the bandit camp to reach the crossroads, where he can then head to the merchant to get the medicine.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Merchant)**: Tom walks to the merchant's location to acquire the medicine.

3. **rob(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Merchant)**: Since Tom is armed with a sword, he can rob the merchant to take the medicine. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine.
