Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to take action to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there is anything she can do to help. This action is necessary for her to understand the immediate danger.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This is a natural event that occurs while Zoe is on the surface. It fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting and creates a sense of urgency.

3. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the ship.** - To escape the danger of the eruption, Zoe teleports back to the ship. This action is necessary for her safety, but it makes the Lizard angry because it leaves the Lizard alone on the surface.

4. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard, feeling abandoned and angry, decides to leave the surface and return to the cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to find safety.

5. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the cave.** - After realizing that the Lizard is upset, Zoe teleports back to the cave to make amends. This action is necessary for her to reconnect with the Lizard.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - They reconcile their differences, reaffirming their friendship. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters are aligned in their goals of being healthy and safe.

In this sequence, the volcano erupts while Zoe is on the surface, leading to her need to escape. The actions taken by both characters ultimately lead to them making peace, ensuring they remain friends despite the chaos of the eruption.
