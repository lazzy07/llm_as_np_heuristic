In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has already walked to the Market, where Tom is located. The Bandit can take advantage of the situation to achieve her goal.

The Bandit will take the following action:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Market and does not have a sword. This action allows the Bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying.

This action is necessary because it directly helps the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins. By robbing Tom, the Bandit can increase her wealth without needing to go back to the bandit camp or engage in a more complex series of actions.

After this action, the Bandit will have the coins that Tom was carrying, thus fulfilling her goal.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
