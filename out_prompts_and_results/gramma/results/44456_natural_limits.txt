The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is present. The bandit knows that the guard is focused on the aftermath of the merchant's attack and believes she can quickly grab the coins from the merchant's chest before the guard notices. 

Once at the market, the bandit attacks the guard, who is not armed with a sword, and kills him. With the guard out of the way, the bandit returns to the crossroads, where she can safely access the chest containing the coins. 

Finally, the bandit loots the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
