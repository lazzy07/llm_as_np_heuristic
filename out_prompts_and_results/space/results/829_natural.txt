1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to meet the Lizard directly and establish a connection. Since she believes the Lizard is at the cave, this is the best way to find him.

2. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to show the Lizard that she is not afraid of the surface and is willing to face the danger together. This action also allows her to demonstrate her bravery and willingness to help.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendship. This is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk back to the cave.** - This action ensures that both characters are safe from the erupting surface. It also reinforces their new friendship as they work together to find safety.
