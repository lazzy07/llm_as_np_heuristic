To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation shows that I2 is in the dining room (R21), and Blake is currently in the dining room (R22) with Alex and Casey. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room. This action is essential for Blake to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room with the chocolates. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but allows Blake to be with Alex and Casey after obtaining the chocolates.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex. This action is necessary because Alex wants to be happy, and by giving the chocolates to Alex, Blake can ensure that Alex is happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex will also be happy because they received the item they wanted.
