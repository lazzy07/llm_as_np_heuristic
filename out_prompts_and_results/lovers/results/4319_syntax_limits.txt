In this story, Alex is currently happy because they have the item they want (I1 - flowers). However, Casey and Blake are not happy because they do not have the items they want (Casey wants I3 - jewelry, and Blake wants I2 - chocolates). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex needs to help Casey obtain the jewelry.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to facilitate further actions.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still happy with the flowers.
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake remains unhappy because they still do not have the chocolates.

However, since Alex's goal is to make Casey happy, this sequence of actions successfully achieves that.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome of making Casey happy, fulfilling Alex's goal.
