In this story, Talia is at the cave with Rory and Gargax, while Vince is at the village with the money. Talia has the treasure, which is valuable, but her happiness is currently at 0. To achieve her goal of becoming happy or wealthy, Talia can take the following action:

1. **Talia proposes to Gargax.** This action is taken because Gargax, being a dragon, is wealthy and does not care about happiness. If Gargax accepts Talia's proposal, they can get married, which will make Talia happy due to the marriage and the potential wealth from Gargax.

After Talia proposes to Gargax, the story concludes with Talia becoming happy through the marriage, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Talia proposes to Gargax:** This action is necessary because it allows Talia to potentially marry Gargax, who is wealthy. Since Talia's goal is to be happy and Gargax does not care about happiness, he is likely to accept the proposal, leading to Talia's happiness.
