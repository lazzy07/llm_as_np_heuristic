To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to Rory, and Rory is also married to Talia. Since Talia's happiness is currently at 0, we can increase her happiness by having Rory propose to her again, which will reaffirm their bond and make her happy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia becoming happy:

1. **Rory proposes to Talia again.** - This action is taken to reaffirm their relationship and increase Talia's happiness. Since they are already married, this proposal will still have a positive effect on Talia's emotional state.

2. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** - Talia accepts the proposal, which will make her happy. This is a necessary step to ensure that the proposal has a positive outcome.

3. **Talia and Rory get married again.** - Although they are already married, this action symbolizes their renewed commitment to each other, further solidifying Talia's happiness.

After these actions, Talia's happiness will increase, fulfilling the goal of the story.
