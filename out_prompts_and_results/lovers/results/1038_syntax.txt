To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary for Alex to interact with them and potentially get the flowers.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Casey to potentially interact with the chocolates (I2) later.

4. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21). This keeps the characters together and allows for further interactions.

At this point, Alex has received the flowers and is happy. The other characters can continue their interactions, but Alex's goal has been achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake and Casey to receive the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the flowers they want.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)** and **move(C3, R22, R21)**: These actions are not necessary for Alex's happiness but help maintain the flow of the story and keep the characters engaged.
