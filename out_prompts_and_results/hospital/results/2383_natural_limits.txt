Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway decides to treat Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This action is risky, but Hathaway's workload is still low enough to avoid a mistake.

Next, Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 2. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms, but Hathaway treats him with steroids, assuming he might have Jarkis. 

Finally, Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C and assesses him. Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms as well, but Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, again assuming he might have Flaze. 

In this scenario, Hathaway's actions are aimed at treating all patients, even with the risk of misdiagnosis due to the Unknown symptoms. The goal of ensuring all patients are treated is achieved, even if not all treatments are correct.
