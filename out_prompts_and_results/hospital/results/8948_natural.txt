**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is too high, decides to first assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. She walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to gather information about the patients who are currently in the admissions room, which will help her assess their conditions.

Once in Admissions, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and Young to identify their symptoms.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.**
   - This action is crucial to determine if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, allowing Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**
   - Similarly, this action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms, ensuring that Hathaway can treat him appropriately.

After assessing both patients, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross has a rash (indicating Jarkis) and Young has a fever (indicating Flaze). 

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C and Young to Patient Room A for treatment.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is needed to assign Ross to a room where he can receive treatment for Jarkis.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.**
   - This action is necessary to assign Young to a room for treatment of Flaze.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross and Young in their respective rooms.

6. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C with steroids.**
   - This action is essential as it matches Ross's symptoms of Jarkis, ensuring he becomes healthy.

7. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**
   - This action is also crucial as it matches Young's symptoms of Flaze, ensuring he becomes healthy.

With both patients treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway has achieved her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (walking and assessing) were necessary to gather information about the patients' conditions.
- The next two actions (admitting) were required to assign the patients to the correct rooms for treatment.
- The final two actions (treating) were essential to provide the correct medical care based on the identified symptoms, leading to the patients' recovery.
