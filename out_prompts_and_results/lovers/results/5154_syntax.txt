To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room to interact with them.

2. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Casey actually wants the flowers (I3). However, this action is necessary to create a misunderstanding that will lead to the next actions.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R21) to check on Casey. This is necessary for Blake to be able to interact with Casey and Alex.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex also moves to the living room (R21) to follow Blake. This keeps all characters in the same room for the next actions.

5. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey for the chocolates (I2). This is the key action that allows Blake to achieve their goal of being happy, as they now have the item they want.

6. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) after the trade. This is not necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to keep the characters in their respective locations.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2), which is what they wanted.
