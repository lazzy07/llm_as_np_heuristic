Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the care he needs, as he is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Ross also receives the care he needs, as he is in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is now in Patient Room A.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.** (This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms so that he can be treated appropriately.)

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.** (Assuming Ross has Jarkis, this action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy, as steroids are the correct treatment for Jarkis.)

After these actions, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, ensuring he is healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway will assess Young in Patient Room B and treat him accordingly, but since the goal is to ensure at least one patient is healthy, the story ends here.
