Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the danger surrounding them due to the erupting volcano. They have successfully made peace and become friends, which is a significant step toward achieving their goals of safety and friendship.

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safe location away from the erupting surface. The cave is a safer environment where they can discuss their next steps without the immediate threat of volcanic activity.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to the cave, ensuring they remain together as friends. This action reinforces their bond and allows them to collaborate on finding a solution to their safety concerns.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace in a safe location strengthens their relationship and ensures that they can work together effectively.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard discuss ways to ensure their safety and health.** - This action is implied as they are in a safe location and can strategize together. They decide to stay in the cave until the volcanic activity subsides, ensuring both of them remain healthy and safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave until the volcano stops erupting.** - This action is crucial as it allows them to avoid danger and ensures their health and safety. They can use this time to bond further and learn more about each other.

By the end of these actions, Zoe has achieved her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
