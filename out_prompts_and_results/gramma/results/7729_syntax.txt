To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk from the Market to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, which is one of her goals.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from her inventory and place them in the chest. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by securing the coins in the chest at the camp, which is the desired outcome.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- The first action is essential for the Bandit to leave the Market, where she is currently located, and go to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to place her coins in the chest, thus achieving her goal of having coins secured.
