To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Alex moves from the living room to the dining room.**

2. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which is the flowers.

3. **Alex moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Alex's goal since they already have the flowers. However, it can be included to show Alex's movement back to the living room.

4. **Alex gives the flowers to Casey.**  
   - This action is included to show that Alex is willing to share their happiness with Casey, which aligns with Alex's desire for Casey to be happy.

5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.**  
   - This action is included to show that Casey is also willing to share their happiness with Blake, which aligns with Casey's desire for Blake to be happy.

6. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.**
