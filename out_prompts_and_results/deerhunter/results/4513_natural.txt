Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has it. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money.

After this action, Bubba will have the money he desires, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money. The clerk is alive and has money, making this the most direct route to fulfill Bubba's desire.
