**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway. He knows he needs to escape before the bully finds him. He takes a moment to gather his courage and then makes a run for it, heading towards the edge of the highway where he can blend in with the outside world.

Meanwhile, Roy is still in the laundry room, unaware of Ernest's successful disguise. He knows he is threatened by the bully but feels trapped. He decides to stay put for now, hoping that Ernest will find a way to help them both.

As Ernest reaches the edge of the highway, he looks back at the prison one last time. He knows that he has to keep moving to ensure his safety. With a deep breath, he steps off the prison grounds and into freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes in the highway**: This action is crucial as it allows Ernest to disguise himself, making it possible for him to escape without being recognized by the guards or the bully.
   
2. **Ernest escapes from the prison**: This is the final action that fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free. By escaping, he ensures that he is no longer threatened by the bully or the prison environment.

Roy remains in the laundry room, but since the story focuses on Ernest achieving his goal, his actions are not necessary for the completion of the story.
