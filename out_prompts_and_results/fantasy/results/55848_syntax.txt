To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her acquiring the treasure and ensuring her happiness through her marriage to Rory. Since Talia is already married to Rory, she is happy. The next step is for Talia to travel to the cave, pick up the treasure, and then return to the village.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to find the treasure. This action is necessary for her to access the treasure, which is essential for her goal of becoming wealthy.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia returns to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary to complete her journey and ensure she is back in a location where she can enjoy her wealth.

After these actions, Talia will have achieved her goal of being happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (by acquiring the treasure).
