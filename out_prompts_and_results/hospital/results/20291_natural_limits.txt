Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to accurately assess him without making a mistake. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C. Ross is still in Admissions and has unknown symptoms, but Hathaway's workload is now back to 1 after treating Jones, allowing for accurate assessment and treatment. 

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C and discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, successfully curing him as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young is still in Admissions and has unknown symptoms, but Hathaway's workload is now back to 1 after treating Ross, allowing for accurate assessment and treatment.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B and discovers he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him.
