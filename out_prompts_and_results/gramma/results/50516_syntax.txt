To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will leave the Market and head to the Crossroads. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to move away from the guard and the dead merchant to a safer location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential as it allows the Bandit to reach her camp where she can store the coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from her inventory and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by moving to a safe location and securing her coins.
