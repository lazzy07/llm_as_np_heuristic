In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp. The Bandit has already attacked Tom, who is now dead, and the Bandit has the opportunity to loot Tom's body for the coin he was carrying.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)** - The Bandit loots Tom's body to take the coin he was carrying.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins. Since Tom is dead, the Bandit can take the coin without any risk of retaliation.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.
