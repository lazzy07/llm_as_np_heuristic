**Story Completion:**

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B, which increases their workload to 3. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

2. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can determine their symptoms. This is crucial for diagnosing the patient correctly.

3. **Assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. This allows Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms, which is essential for providing the correct treatment.

4. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has Flaze (fever) and treats them with antibiotics, which cures Young. This action is vital for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

5. **Treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway determines that Ross has Jarkis (rash) and treats them with steroids, which cures Ross. This further ensures that all patients are healthy.
