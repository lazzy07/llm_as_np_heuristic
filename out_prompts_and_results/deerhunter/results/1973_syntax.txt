To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and potentially steal the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can steal the money from the Clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can return to the Forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the Bank with the stolen money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi in the Forest. This action fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead, which is one of the goals of the story.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the Clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to escape with the stolen money, ensuring he has it in his possession.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second condition of the story.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)"
