Zoe and the Lizard are at the surface of the planet, and they are friends. However, the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, they need to take action quickly.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate threat of the eruption.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs after Zoe has teleported to the spaceship, ensuring that she is safe. The eruption is a critical plot point that demonstrates the danger of the surface.

3. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard, realizing the danger of the eruption, moves to a safer location, the cave, to avoid being harmed.

4. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - After ensuring the volcano has erupted and the danger has passed for her, Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action is taken to maintain their friendship and ensure they are together in a safe location.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they were already friends, this action reinforces their bond after the danger has passed. It symbolizes their mutual understanding and desire for safety and friendship.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully avoids the eruption, while the Lizard also escapes to safety. Their actions lead to a stronger friendship, and the volcano erupts, fulfilling the story's requirements.
