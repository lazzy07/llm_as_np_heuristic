**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to accurately assess Young without making a mistake. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy as a result of the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Since both are still in Admissions and their symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones first. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Jones has a rash, indicating that Jones has Jarkis. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. Jones becomes healthy as a result of the treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross also has a rash, indicating that Ross has Jarkis as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, and Ross becomes healthy.

At this point, all patients—Young, Jones, and Ross—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
