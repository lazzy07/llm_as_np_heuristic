In the current situation, the Bandit is already in the Market, where she has just attacked both Tom and the Merchant. Since Tom is dead and the Merchant is also dead, the Bandit can now loot the Merchant's corpse to obtain the medicine. This action will help the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she can now take the medicine and potentially sell it later for coins.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)** - The Bandit loots the medicine from the Merchant's corpse in the Market.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire the medicine, which she can use to further her goals of obtaining coins, either by selling it or using it as leverage.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible story where the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying more items, specifically the medicine, after successfully eliminating both Tom and the Merchant.
