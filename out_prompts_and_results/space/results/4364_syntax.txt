To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the best course of action is to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship for safety. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard are currently not fighting, and they have a positive relationship. By making peace, Zoe can solidify their friendship and ensure that both characters feel safe and healthy. This action aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be friends.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe can teleport back to the spaceship. This action is necessary for her safety, as the surface is currently dangerous.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **make_peace**: This action is crucial as it helps Zoe achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard, ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy.
- **teleport_to_ship**: This action is necessary for Zoe's safety, allowing her to leave the dangerous surface and return to the safety of her spaceship.
