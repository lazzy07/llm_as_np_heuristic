Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware that the surface is dangerous, and they want to ensure their safety and health while also fostering a friendship.

To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship from the cave. This action ensures her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she can continue her exploration from the safety of her ship.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
