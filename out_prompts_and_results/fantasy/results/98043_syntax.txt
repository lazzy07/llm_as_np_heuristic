To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia is already engaged to both Rory and Vince, she can leverage this situation to gain wealth. The key is for Talia to marry one of them, which will make her happy, and then she can take the money from Vince, who currently possesses it.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory, which makes her happy. This is essential for her goal of happiness.
2. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for her to access the treasure.
3. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince, who is in the village. This action is crucial for her to achieve wealth.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Marrying Rory**: This action fulfills Talia's need for happiness, as she is now in a committed relationship. 
- **Traveling to the Cave**: This action is necessary for Talia to access the treasure, which is a part of her goal to be wealthy.
- **Taking Money from Vince**: This action directly contributes to Talia's wealth, as she now possesses the money.

With these actions, Talia achieves her goals of being both happy and wealthy.
