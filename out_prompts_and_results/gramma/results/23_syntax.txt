To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **Action: walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)** - The bandit is currently at the Crossroads and prefers to be at the Bandit Camp. This action allows the bandit to move to her preferred location.

2. **Action: take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)** - Once at the Bandit Camp, the bandit can take the coins from the chest. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The story is short because the bandit is already in a position to achieve her goal without needing to interact with other characters or items. The bandit simply moves to her camp and takes the coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary for the bandit to reach her preferred location, where she can access the coins.
- The second action is the culmination of her goal, as it allows her to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
