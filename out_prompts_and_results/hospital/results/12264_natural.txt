**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room B, where Jones is currently located. Since Dr. Hathaway is overwhelmed, there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosing Jones. To ensure Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions are taken:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. However, due to Dr. Hathaway's high workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis (due to the high workload), they administer steroids instead of antibiotics. This is a critical moment because if the treatment is incorrect, Jones could die. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, we will assume that the treatment is effective for the sake of the story.

3. **Jones walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is taken to ensure that Jones is in a different room, possibly to avoid any further complications or to prepare for a follow-up.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room A.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway follows Jones to continue monitoring their health and ensure they are recovering.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones again in Patient Room A.**  
   - This final assessment confirms that Jones is healthy after the treatment.

Through these actions, Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, despite the potential for misdiagnosis.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The assessment and treatment of Jones are crucial for determining and addressing their health condition.
- The movement between rooms allows for continuity of care and monitoring.
- The final assessment ensures that Jones's health status is confirmed as healthy.
