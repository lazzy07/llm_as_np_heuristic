To achieve Bubba's goal of having 1 money, he needs to take actions that will allow him to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba already has 1 money, he needs to ensure that he can keep it and not lose it to the clerk. The simplest way to achieve this is for Bubba to shoot the clerk, ensuring that he can take the clerk's money without any resistance.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action is necessary because it eliminates the clerk as a threat and allows Bubba to take the clerk's money without any opposition.
2. **Bubba decides to take the clerk's money.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk has, which will fulfill his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **Shooting the clerk**: This is essential for Bubba to secure the money without any risk of being stopped or confronted by the clerk.
- **Taking the clerk's money**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal.
