Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Ross with steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking it will help with the assumed Jarkis. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies. 

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room A, where they can be assessed next. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has assessed one patient, treated one patient (albeit incorrectly), and admitted another patient, which helps to reduce the workload and allows for further assessment of Young in the next steps.

**Explanation of Actions**:
- Assessing Ross is necessary to determine his condition, even though it leads to a mistake due to the high workload.
- Treating Ross is a direct action to help him, even though it results in his death due to the misdiagnosis.
- Admitting Young is essential to ensure that all patients are being attended to, which is part of Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
