**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Exam Room B. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients assigned to Exam Room A and Exam Room C. 

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.
   
2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Assuming Ross has Flaze (due to the fever symptom), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway then assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify Young's condition and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: Assuming Young has Jarkis (due to the rash symptom), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is essential to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify Jones's condition and provide appropriate treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Assuming Jones has Flaze (due to the fever symptom), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each assessment is necessary to identify the symptoms of the patients, which is critical for providing the correct treatment.
- Each treatment is based on the assumption of the disease corresponding to the symptoms identified during the assessment.
- The sequence of actions is designed to minimize the workload and ensure that Hathaway does not make a mistake due to being overworked.
