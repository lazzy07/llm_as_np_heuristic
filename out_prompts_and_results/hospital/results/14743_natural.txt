**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A and confirms he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room B. Young walks to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and finds he has no visible symptoms, but since he is still in the admissions room, he is not treated yet. 

Dr. Hathaway then returns to Patient Room C to assess Jones. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Jones has no visible symptoms either. Since both Young and Jones are not showing any symptoms, they remain in the admissions room without treatment.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, and all patients are alive and healthy, achieving their goal.
