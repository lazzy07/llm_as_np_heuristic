To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank with the rifle loaded and has a desire for money. The bank clerk is also present in the bank, and Bubba is greedy, which means he wants to take the clerk's money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the clerk's money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his position and possibly hide the money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba will decide to eat, fulfilling his hunger. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking care of his needs after acquiring the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money and being alive, which satisfies the goal.
