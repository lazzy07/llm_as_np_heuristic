Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money to satisfy his hunger. He knows the clerk at the bank has money, but he also sees Bambi in the forest, who he could potentially eat. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to be able to shoot either Bambi or intimidate the clerk if he decides to go back to the bank.)
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (Bubba wants to eat, and since Bambi is alive, this action allows him to fulfill his hunger by killing Bambi.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** (After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer, satisfying his hunger.)
4. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** (Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can take the money that he believes Bambi has, achieving his goal of having money.)

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba being satisfied both in terms of hunger and greed, as he ends up with the money and has eaten Bambi.
