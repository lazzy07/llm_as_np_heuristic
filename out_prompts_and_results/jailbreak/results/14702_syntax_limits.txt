**Story Completion:**

After stealing the pack of cigarettes, Roy is caught in the laundry room and the guards confiscate the cigarettes, punishing him by making him clean the highway. Meanwhile, Ernest remains in the cell block, feeling threatened by the bully who is in the gym. 

On day two, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, manages to escape from the highway. However, he knows that Ernest is still in danger. He decides to return to the prison to help his friend. 

Roy sneaks back into the prison through the vents and finds himself in the hallway. He knows he needs to act quickly to save Ernest from the bully. He moves to the gym and locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside.
