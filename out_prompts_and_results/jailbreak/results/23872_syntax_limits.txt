**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest, who is currently in the gym, realizes that he is threatened by the bully. He knows he needs to act quickly to ensure his survival and to secure a pack of cigarettes. Since he has already stolen a knife from the kitchen, he decides to take a bold step. 

Ernest locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, giving Ernest a chance to confront him without the risk of being interrupted or attacked by others. 

Next, with the knife in hand, Ernest takes revenge on the bully. This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring his safety and allowing him to enjoy his time in prison without fear. 

With the bully dead, Ernest can now take the pack of cigarettes that Roy has, as he knows Roy is safe in the laundry room.
