In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the jewelry, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey also wants the jewelry. 

To achieve his goal, Blake decides to take action. He picks up the jewelry from the living room and gives it to Casey. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to be happy, which in turn makes Blake happy since he wants Alex to be happy and knows that Casey is also seeking the jewelry.
