To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. The bandit loots the merchant's corpse to take the hero's coin.
2. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp to place the coin in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Looting the Merchant's Corpse**: The bandit takes advantage of the situation where the merchant is dead. Since the merchant had the hero's coin, this action allows the bandit to acquire a coin without any risk of being attacked, as the merchant is no longer a threat.
   
2. **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: After acquiring the coin, the bandit moves to the bandit camp. This action fulfills the bandit's goal of either carrying coins or placing them in the chest at the camp. By placing the coin in the chest, the bandit ensures that the coin is secured and contributes to her goal of having coins.
