In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (chocolates) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with item I3 (jewelry). Blake (C2) has item I1 (chocolates) but wants item I2 (flowers) to be happy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I1) they have with Alex for the flowers (I2) that they want. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the chocolates they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have chocolates (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have flowers (I2) and will be happy.
- Casey will still have jewelry (I3) and will remain happy.

This single action effectively fulfills Alex's goal of happiness.
