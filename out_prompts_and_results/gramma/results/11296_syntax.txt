To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently carrying the TomCoin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count, as she wants to have as many coins as possible.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the BanditCoin and place it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully stored her coins, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then secures her coins in the chest, achieving her goal without any further conflict.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: This action is essential for the Bandit to acquire more coins, which is her primary goal. Tom is an easy target since he is armed but not a criminal, making him vulnerable to robbery.
  
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to secure her coins in a safe location, ensuring that her goal of having coins in the chest is met.
