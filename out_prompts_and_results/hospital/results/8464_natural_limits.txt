Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, assesses Young in Patient Room A. She observes that Young has a fever, which indicates that Young has Flaze. However, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Young has Jarkis instead. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Young is actually suffering from Flaze, this treatment is incorrect. However, the story must ensure that Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. 

Fortunately, the incorrect treatment does not lead to Young's death, as the story allows for a positive outcome despite the mistake. Young remains alive and healthy after the treatment, achieving their goal.
