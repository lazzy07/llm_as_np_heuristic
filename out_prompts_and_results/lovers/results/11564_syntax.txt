To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates, which are currently in the dining room.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) as well. This is important because Blake needs to be present to facilitate the trade of items.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the flowers (I1). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to give the flowers to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for the flowers.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) with the flowers. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex to give them the flowers.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is their desired item.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the dining room to access the chocolates.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to be in the dining room to facilitate the trade.
- **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: This action allows Casey to obtain the flowers that Alex wants.
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to return to the living room to give the flowers to Alex.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.
