**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, feeling threatened by the bully. Meanwhile, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is outside on the highway, ready to escape. 

To ensure his safety and achieve his goal of escaping, Roy decides to take action. He knows that the bully is still in the cells and that Ernest is in the laundry, but he cannot help Ernest directly without risking his own safety. 

**Action 1:** Roy chooses to escape from the prison while he is disguised in civilian clothes. This action is crucial because it allows him to leave the prison without being recognized, thus achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Action 2:** Since Roy has successfully escaped, he can no longer be threatened by the bully, and he leaves the prison behind, ensuring his safety.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **escape(Roy, Highway)** - This action is necessary for Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free. By escaping, he removes himself from the threat posed by the bully and the prison environment.
2. **next_day()** - This action signifies the end of Day 1 and the beginning of Day 2, but it is implicit in the story that Roy has successfully escaped and is no longer in danger.
