Bubba is determined to get money, and he is currently hungry. He has the rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the power to take action against the bank clerk. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.**

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having 1 money.
