To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom at the Crossroads to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the market or engage in more complex actions.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins there.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit successfully robs Tom of his coin. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count, moving her closer to her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her newly acquired coins. This action is necessary to ensure that the coins are secured in the chest at the Bandit Camp.

At the end of these actions, the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying coins or having them in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
