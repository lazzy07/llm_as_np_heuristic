To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory obtaining both wealth and happiness while ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the Cave to the Village to be closer to Talia and Vince, who are both in the Village. This is necessary for Rory to interact with them and potentially improve his happiness.

2. **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory accepts Talia's proposal. This action makes both Rory and Talia happy, which is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of happiness.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures Rory's happiness.

4. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the Money that is with Vince. This action increases Rory's wealth, which is another goal he wants to achieve.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is necessary to show that Rory is not currently hungry, as he has just picked up money and is not in a state of hunger yet.

By following these actions, Rory achieves his goals of happiness (through marriage with Talia) and wealth (by picking up the money). He remains not hungry throughout the process.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to be in the Village to interact with Talia and Vince.

- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Marriage is a significant step that ensures Rory's happiness.
- **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Picking up the money increases Rory's wealth, fulfilling another part of his goal.
- **get_hungry(Rory)**: This action is included to show that Rory is not hungry, as he has just achieved his wealth and happiness.
