To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to leave the market and head to the cottage. Since he has already looted the medicine from the merchant, he can simply walk to the cottage.

Here’s the complete story with the necessary action:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the market to the cottage, successfully reaching his destination while carrying the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. No other actions are needed since Tom already has the medicine.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
