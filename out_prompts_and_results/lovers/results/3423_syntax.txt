To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to Casey and Blake, who are currently in the same room with the jewelry.
2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to follow Alex, as they want to be near their friends.
3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which means they will be happy. 

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- The first two moves are necessary to bring Alex and Casey into the same room where the jewelry is located, allowing for the transfer of the item.
- The give action is essential as it directly results in Alex obtaining the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
