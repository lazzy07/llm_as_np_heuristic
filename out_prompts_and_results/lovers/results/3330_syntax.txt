To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially get the item.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because Casey wants to make Blake happy, and by giving away the chocolates, Casey can help Alex in the process.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the bathroom (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Blake and potentially get the jewelry.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which means Alex is happy. 

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.
- **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Casey gives chocolates to Alex, which is a step towards making Alex happy, even if it doesn't directly fulfill Alex's desire.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to move to Blake's location to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:
