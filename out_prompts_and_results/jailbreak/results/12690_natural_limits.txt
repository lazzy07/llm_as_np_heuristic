**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Ernest, still in the laundry room, realizes that the bully is furious about the stolen cigarettes. He knows he must act quickly to protect himself and Roy. He decides to sneak through the vents to the gym, where he believes Roy is being threatened by the bully.

Meanwhile, in the gym, Roy is cornered by the bully, who is demanding the return of the cigarettes. Roy, feeling trapped, knows he needs to find a way to escape or fight back. He remembers that the knife is in the kitchen, but he has no way to get there without being caught.

Ernest crawls through the vents and emerges in the gym, surprising both Roy and the bully. He quickly assesses the situation and realizes that the only way to ensure their safety is to confront the bully. With a surge of courage, he grabs the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously planned to retrieve, and uses it to kill the bully in a desperate act of self-defense.
