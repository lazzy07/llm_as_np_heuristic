To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank and is greedy, wanting money. The bank clerk is also present and has money. Bubba is hungry, but his primary goal is to acquire money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, having a loaded rifle, can steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is included to show that Bubba is moving away from the bank after successfully stealing the money.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is already dead (as indicated by the previous events), Bubba can eat Bambi. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a secondary goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go**: This action shows Bubba leaving the bank after the theft, indicating he is moving to a new location.
- **eat**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger by consuming Bambi, who is already dead.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money from the clerk, and Bambi will be dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
