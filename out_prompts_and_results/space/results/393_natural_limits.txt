Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to take action to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to assess the situation on the surface and to understand the threat posed by the volcano. 

2. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting. 

3. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action allows Zoe to escape the danger of the eruption, ensuring her safety. However, it makes the Lizard angry, which is a consequence of her action but does not lead to a fight since they are friends.

In this short story, Zoe successfully navigates the danger of the erupting volcano while maintaining her friendship with the Lizard, even though her teleportation angers him.
