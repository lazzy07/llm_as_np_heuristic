In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp with the Medicine, while Tom is at the Market. The Bandit is at the Crossroads, and the Guard is at the Market. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is at the Market and has a coin. This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be near Tom to potentially sell him the Medicine for a coin.

After this action, the Merchant can then sell the Medicine to Tom, thus achieving her goal of acquiring a coin without becoming a criminal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant walking to the Crossroads allows her to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is the only character with a coin. This is a strategic move to ensure she can sell the Medicine and gain a coin.
