To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard. Given the current situation, the volcano is dangerous, and both characters are on the surface. The best course of action is for Zoe to make peace with the Lizard and then teleport back to the spaceship for safety.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action solidifies the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends with other creatures.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe can safely teleport back to the spaceship. This action is crucial because the surface is dangerous due to the volcano, and Zoe needs to ensure her safety.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **make_peace**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends and ensuring that the Lizard is no longer seen as an enemy.
- **teleport_to_ship**: Ensures Zoe's safety by moving her away from the dangerous surface, fulfilling her goal of being healthy and safe.
