To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to acquire the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and potentially take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk using the threat of his loaded rifle, ensuring that he ends up with the money.
