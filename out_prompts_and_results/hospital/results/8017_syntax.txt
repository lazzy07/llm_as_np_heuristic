To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake in diagnosing Jones. However, we will assume that Hathaway correctly assesses Jones and finds that he has a symptom of Flaze (fever). This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Jones.

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Jones healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Next, Hathaway will assess Young, who is also in Exam Room A. Assuming Young has a symptom of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will correctly identify this.

4. **Treat Young with Steroids in Exam Room A**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Young healthy.

5. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is in Exam Room C. Assuming Ross has a symptom of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will correctly identify this.

6. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Ross healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
