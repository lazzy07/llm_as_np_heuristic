To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with the bank clerk, and he is hungry. He has already stolen the rifle from the clerk, which gives him power over the situation. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and take control of the bank. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to access the money without any opposition.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and also allows him to take the money that the clerk had.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to take the money from the clerk after eating him. This action is necessary to fulfill his greed and achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk. This action completes his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take control of the situation.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to take the clerk's money.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's intention to acquire money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finalizes the acquisition of money, achieving Bubba's goal.
