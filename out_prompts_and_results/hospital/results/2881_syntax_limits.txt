In this story, Jones is in Patient Room A, and Hathaway is also in Patient Room A. Ross and Young are in the admissions room. Hathaway has a workload of 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if she assesses or treats a patient. To ensure Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. Since we want to ensure Jones achieves his goal, we will assume Hathaway correctly identifies the disease and treats him appropriately.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk Ross to Exam Room A. This action is not strictly necessary for Jones's goal but helps to ensure that Ross can also receive care, which is consistent with Hathaway's goal of wanting all patients to be healthy.

4. **Walk Young to Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will walk Young to Exam Room B. Similar to Ross, this action ensures that Young can also receive care, maintaining the theme of health for all patients.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Jones)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for identifying the correct treatment.
2. **Treat(Jones)**: Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment. This is the key action that ensures Jones becomes healthy.
3. **Walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway walks Ross to Exam Room A to ensure he can also receive treatment.
4. **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway walks Young to Exam Room B to ensure he can also receive treatment.

By following these actions, Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, and the other patients are also positioned to receive care.
