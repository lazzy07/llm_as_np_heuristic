To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters take actions that lead to the volcano erupting, while also allowing for the possibility of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both characters. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending danger and to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting.

2. **attack(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attacks the Lizard. This action is taken because, despite their initial non-fighting status, the eruption creates a sense of urgency and fear, leading Zoe to act defensively. This action will escalate the relationship to a negative state, but it is a necessary step to create tension.

3. **stun(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard stuns Zoe in response to her attack. This action is taken to show that the Lizard is defending itself and to create a moment of vulnerability for Zoe, which is crucial for the next steps.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, killing Zoe. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying and adds a dramatic conclusion to the story.

5. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: After the eruption, the Lizard reflects on the events and realizes that Zoe was acting out of fear. In a moment of understanding, the Lizard makes peace with Zoe, despite her death. This action symbolizes the potential for friendship that was lost due to the circumstances.
