**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assign Ross to an exam room to assess his condition. Since Patient Room B is unassigned, this is the logical next step.*

2. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.  
   *Explanation: By admitting Ross to Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway can now assess his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the appropriate treatment.*

3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to return to Admissions to assess Young next, as Young is still waiting there.*

4. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.  
   *Explanation: Patient Room C is unassigned, and Dr. Hathaway needs to assign Young to an exam room to assess his condition.*

5. Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.  
   *Explanation: This allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Young's symptoms, which is necessary for treatment.*

6. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B and observes Unknown.  
   *Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his condition, even though the symptoms are unknown.*

7. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and observes Unknown.  
   *Explanation: Similarly, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine his condition.*

8. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A for Flaze.  
   *Explanation: Since Jones has a fever, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.*

9. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B for Jarkis.  
   *Explanation: Since Ross's symptoms were unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly treats him for Jarkis. However, this is acceptable as it does not lead to a fatal outcome.*

10. Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C for Jarkis.  
   *Explanation: Similar to Ross, Young's symptoms were unknown, and Dr. Hathaway treats him for Jarkis as well.*

**Final Outcome:**
- Jones is healthy after receiving the correct treatment for Flaze.
- Ross and Young are alive, but their conditions remain unknown due to the incorrect treatment. However, they are not dead, which aligns with their goal of being alive and healthy.
