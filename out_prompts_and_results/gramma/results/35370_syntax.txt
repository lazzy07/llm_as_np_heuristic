To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step for the Bandit to increase her wealth without drawing attention from the Guard, as Tom is not armed and cannot defend himself.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is crucial for the Bandit to escape the market and secure her loot in a safe location.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored safely, achieving her goal of having as many coins as possible.
