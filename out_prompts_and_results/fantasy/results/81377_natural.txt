To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave, and the treasure is there. Since Talia is already married to Rory and Vince, her happiness is not directly affected by their actions. However, she can achieve wealth by obtaining the treasure.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia becoming wealthy:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and picking it up will increase Talia's wealth.

After this action, Talia will have the treasure, which will make her wealthy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, as she will now possess the treasure.

At this point, Talia is wealthy, fulfilling her goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Talia picks up the treasure"]
}

This plan ensures that Talia achieves her goal of becoming wealthy in the shortest possible way.
