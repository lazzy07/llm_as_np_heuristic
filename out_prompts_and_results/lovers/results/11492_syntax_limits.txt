In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I1 (flowers), which is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Blake can help Alex get the item they want.

1. **Action: trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R22)** - Blake can trade the item they have (I1, which is currently with Casey) for the item that Casey has (I2, which is unknown but assumed to be something Casey wants). This action allows Blake to give Alex the flowers they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the item they received from Casey (I2) and will also be happy, achieving their goal of making Alex happy.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The trade action is necessary because it allows Blake to facilitate Alex's happiness by ensuring they receive the item they desire. Since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, this action directly contributes to that outcome.
