To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has the money but is not in the forest, so Bubba needs to take action to either acquire the money or eliminate Bambi to satisfy his hunger.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and Bambi is a potential source of food. By shooting Bambi, he can eat and satisfy his hunger.
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action directly results in Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions for the ending.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat her, which satisfies his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of satisfying his hunger by eating Bambi, and Bambi is dead. The story ends here, as Bubba has fulfilled one of the conditions.
