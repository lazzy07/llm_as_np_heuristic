To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones's recovery.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This completes the treatment for all patients.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
