Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money to satisfy his hunger. He knows the bank clerk has money, and he believes he can get it. 

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba needs to return to the forest after acquiring the money.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Now that Bubba has the money, he can satisfy his hunger.)

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling his goal.
