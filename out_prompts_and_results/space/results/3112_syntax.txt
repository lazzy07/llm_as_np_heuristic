1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing the need for cooperation to survive the volcanic eruption. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it establishes a positive relationship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave, which is a safer location away from the danger of the volcano. This action is necessary to ensure their safety.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, solidifying their newfound friendship and ensuring both characters are safe from the eruption. 

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are safely in the cave, they are unharmed. This event confirms that their actions to move to the cave were successful.

By making peace and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
