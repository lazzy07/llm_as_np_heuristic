Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. The clerk has the money that Bubba desires. To achieve his goal, Bubba will take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to shoot the clerk and take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money.)

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action establishes Bubba's intent to take the money, the second action allows him to eliminate the clerk as an obstacle, and the third action allows him to claim the money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."
