Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, stands at the market, where the merchant has the medicine he desires. The bandit, also at the market, poses a threat to Tom's goal. To ensure he can safely obtain the medicine, Tom decides to take action against the bandit.

1. **Tom attacks the bandit**: Since Tom is armed and the bandit is not, he can attack her. This action eliminates the bandit, ensuring that she can no longer interfere with Tom's goal of obtaining the medicine.

2. **Tom loots the bandit's corpse**: After defeating the bandit, Tom can loot her body. This action allows him to take the medicine from the merchant, as the bandit no longer poses a threat.

With the bandit defeated, Tom can now safely approach the merchant and retrieve the medicine without any risk.
