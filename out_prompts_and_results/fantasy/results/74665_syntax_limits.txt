In this story, Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and wants to be wealthy. The quickest way for Gargax to achieve this goal is to eat Vince, who is currently at the cave with some money. By eating Vince, Gargax will not only satisfy his hunger but also acquire the money that Vince possesses.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince, which satisfies Gargax's hunger and allows him to take the money that Vince had.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy and not hungry. After this action, Gargax will have the money and will no longer be hungry.
