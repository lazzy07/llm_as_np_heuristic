**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of another patient.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, this is a necessary step to ensure that Young is treated appropriately.

After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing Young has Flaze due to the unknown symptoms. This action is risky, but it is necessary to attempt to treat Young and reduce Hathaway's workload back to 1.

Dr. Hathaway then walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones to Exam Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 again.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room C. Since Jones is also experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway again cannot determine the disease. However, this assessment is crucial for the next step.

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, mistakenly believing Jones has Jarkis. This action is also risky, but it is necessary to attempt to treat Jones.

At this point, both Young and Jones have been treated, and Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is achieved, even if the outcomes are uncertain.
