To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat more than one patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to assess and treat each patient one at a time, starting with Jones, who is already in Exam Room A.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.
   
2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then walk to Exam Room B to assess Ross. This is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Walk to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will walk to Exam Room C to assess Young. This is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.

7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

8. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients without making any mistakes, as they only assess and treat one patient at a time, keeping their workload manageable.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, "treatment_for_symptom" should be replaced with either "antibiotics" or "steroids" based on the actual symptoms assessed for each patient.
