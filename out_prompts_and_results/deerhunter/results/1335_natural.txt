To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with a loaded rifle and wants to have money. The clerk is also at the bank and wants money but has none. Bambi is in the forest and is alive.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential threat to his goal of obtaining money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money without opposition.
   
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** This action directly fulfills the first action's intention. The clerk is killed, and Bubba can now take the money without any risk.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, achieving his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the story's requirement is satisfied since Bubba has the money.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** (Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk to secure the money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (This action results in the clerk's death, allowing Bubba to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (Bubba achieves his goal of having money.)
