Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway is cautious but decides to treat Young with steroids, believing it might be Jarkis. This action is taken because it is essential for Hathaway to treat patients to achieve their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. 

After administering the treatment, Young responds positively and becomes healthy. This outcome fulfills Hathaway's goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he has a rash, indicating Jarkis.
