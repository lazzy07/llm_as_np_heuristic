In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (jewelry) to be happy, and they believe that it is currently with Casey (C2). Since Alex is in the same room as Casey, they can take action to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
1. **trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R22)** - Alex trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has.
