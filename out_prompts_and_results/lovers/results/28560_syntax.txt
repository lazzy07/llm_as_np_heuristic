To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the flowers (I3) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy.

2. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: After the trade, Alex (C1) will give the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C3). This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy, as they want the flowers (I3) that Blake has.

3. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey (C3) will pick up the jewelry (I1) that Alex (C1) just gave them. This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, which contributes to their happiness.

4. **put_down(C2, I3, R22)**: Blake (C2) will put down the flowers (I3) in the room. This action is included to signify that Blake is satisfied with the trade and is no longer holding onto the flowers.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted, and Casey will also be happy because they have received the flowers. Blake will be happy as well since they helped Alex achieve their goal.
