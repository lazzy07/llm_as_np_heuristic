**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees the bully distracted, lifting weights. Roy quietly pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen. With a swift motion, he approaches the bully from behind and plunges the knife into him, killing the bully instantly. 

With the threat eliminated, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. Now, feeling a sense of relief, he heads back through the vent to the hallway. Once in the hallway, he puts on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise. 

Finally, Roy makes his way to the highway outside the prison, successfully escaping without being detected.
