Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous situation due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard. 

To achieve her goal, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to make peace. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's primary goals. By making peace, they can work together to ensure their safety.

2. **Walk to Cave**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters remain safe from the danger on the surface.

3. **Stay in Cave**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can continue to build their friendship and discuss ways to protect their home. This action is implied as they remain in the cave, ensuring their safety and allowing for further bonding.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making a friend in the Lizard.
