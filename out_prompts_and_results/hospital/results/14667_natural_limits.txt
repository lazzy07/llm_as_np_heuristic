1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, assessing him will help identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway discovers that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to check on the other patients, Jones and Young, who are still in Admissions. This action is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.
