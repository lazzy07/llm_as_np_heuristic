To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the Cave to the Surface. This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be on the same location as Zoe to interact with her and potentially make peace.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Once the Lizard is on the Surface, it will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial for establishing a friendly relationship, which is one of the Lizard's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the Cave with the Lizard. This action is important as it allows both characters to be in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship from the Surface. This action ensures that Zoe is safe from the volcano, while the Lizard remains on the Surface, achieving its goal of being healthy and safe.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Lizard achieves its goals of safety and friendship with Zoe, while also allowing Zoe to maintain her health and safety.
