To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R22) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from the bathroom. This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential interactions with other characters.

4. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C2). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy, as Alex is the one who can make Blake happy by giving them the chocolates.

5. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R22) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that they want. This action is necessary for Alex to achieve their happiness.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R22)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom. This is essential for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

7. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12). This action is again not strictly necessary but helps maintain the flow of the story.

8. **give(C2, I2, C1, R12)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C1). This action ensures that Blake achieves their happiness.

By following these actions, Casey will achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry, and the other characters will also achieve their goals, creating a harmonious ending.
