Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) so that she can assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). Since Jones is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, this assessment is crucial for proper treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to identify his symptoms and provide the correct treatment. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - Finally, assessing Young ensures that all patients are evaluated, allowing Dr. Hathaway to treat them accordingly.

After assessing all three patients, Dr. Hathaway determines their symptoms and treats them appropriately, ensuring they all become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is aimed at fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. By walking to admissions and assessing each patient, she can identify their conditions and provide the necessary treatments.
