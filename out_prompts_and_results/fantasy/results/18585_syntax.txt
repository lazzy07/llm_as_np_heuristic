To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are now engaged, and Rory's wealth. The goal is to have Talia become happy by marrying Rory and potentially gaining wealth through their union.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the Cave to be closer to the action and possibly help Talia and Rory.
2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, which will increase his wealth.
3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village with the treasure.
4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia, which makes both of them happy.
5. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Village)**: Talia picks up the treasure that Rory brought back, increasing her wealth.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince moves to the Cave to be part of the unfolding events and support his friends.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory collects the treasure, which is essential for increasing his wealth and potentially Talia's as well.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the Village with the treasure, making it available for Talia.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action is crucial as it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through marriage.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Village)**: Talia picks up the treasure, which directly contributes to her wealth, fulfilling her goal.

By the end of these actions, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage) and wealthy (due to the treasure).
