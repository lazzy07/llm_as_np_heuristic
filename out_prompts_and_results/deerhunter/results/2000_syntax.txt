To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the Bank, he can use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the Clerk, who is the only character with money, allowing Bubba to take it.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the Bank. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can return to the Forest with the money. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the Bank with the money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where the money is.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the Clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba takes the money from the Bank.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the Bank with the money.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal.
