In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1) they want. However, Blake (C2) and Casey (C3) are not happy because they do not have the items they want. Blake wants the flowers (I2), and Casey wants the chocolates (I3). 

To help Casey achieve their goal, the following action can be taken:

1. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I2) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R21). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the chocolates (I3) by providing them with the item they want, which is the flowers. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) remains happy with the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) is now happy with the flowers (I2).
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they received the flowers (I2) from Blake.

Thus, Casey achieves their goal of being happy.
