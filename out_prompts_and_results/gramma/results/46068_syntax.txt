To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to reach the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine in his possession, and there are no obstacles preventing him from walking to the Cottage. The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) are not interfering with Tom's goal, and he is not in danger of being attacked or robbed.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary for Tom to reach his goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine. Since he is already at the Crossroads and the path to the Cottage is available, this action directly fulfills his objective.
