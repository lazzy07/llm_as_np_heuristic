To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is already married to Rory, which means she is happy. However, she is not wealthy, and the treasure is at the cave. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and may pose a threat to Talia and Rory. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia becoming wealthy:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and will eat Rory, leaving Talia alone with Gargax. This will allow Talia to take the treasure without any interference.
   
2. **Talia picks up the treasure**: After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can safely pick up the treasure that is at the cave. This action will make Talia wealthy.

3. **Talia travels back to the village**: Talia can then travel back to the village with the treasure, ensuring her safety and allowing her to enjoy her newfound wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action eliminates Rory, allowing Talia to access the treasure without any obstacles.
- **Talia picks up the treasure**: This action directly contributes to Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.
- **Talia travels back to the village**: This action ensures Talia's safety and allows her to enjoy her wealth in the village.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy, fulfilling her goal.
