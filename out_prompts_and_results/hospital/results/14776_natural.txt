**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Ross, who is currently in Patient Room A and exhibiting a fever, a symptom of the disease Flaze. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Ross has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. By treating him with antibiotics, Dr. Hathaway can ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

After treating Ross, he is now healthy. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the other patients, Jones and Young, who are currently in the admissions room.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the attention he needs, as he is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assigned to an exam room.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** Assuming that Jones has a rash (the only other symptom that could be present), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, ensuring that he becomes healthy as well.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions.** This action is necessary to assess Young, who is still in the admissions room.

7. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure Young receives the necessary care.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** Assuming Young also has a rash, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, ensuring that he becomes healthy as well.

At the end of these actions, all patients—Ross, Jones, and Young—are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.

- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients to ensure they become healthy.
