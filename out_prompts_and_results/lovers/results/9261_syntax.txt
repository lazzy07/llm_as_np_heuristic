To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R12) and does not have the jewelry, while Casey (C3) has given the jewelry to Blake (C2). 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I3) they have with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I1). This is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy, and Blake is currently holding it.

2. **Move**: After the trade, Alex will be happy because they will have the jewelry. 

The actions are as follows:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex trades the flowers they received from Casey for the jewelry that Blake has. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry.

2. **move(C1, R12, R12)**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but can be included to signify that Alex is now in a state of happiness with the jewelry.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R12)",
    "move(C1, R12, R12)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Trade**: This action is essential as it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is the item they want to be happy.
- **Move**: While this action does not change the state of happiness, it can be included to indicate that Alex is now in a positive state with the item they desired.
