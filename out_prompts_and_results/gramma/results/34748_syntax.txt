To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom will walk to the Market, where he can potentially buy more items or interact with the Merchant.

3. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy a coin from Tom, giving her one more coin without committing a crime.

4. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads, allowing her to be in a neutral location.

5. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom will also walk back to the Crossroads, where he can decide his next move.

6. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk to the Crossroads, potentially looking for opportunities to rob or interact with others.

7. **report(Tom, Bandit, Market)**: Tom will report the Bandit’s location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is targeted and potentially removed from the scene.

8. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit based on Tom's report.

9. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, eliminating her as a threat and allowing the Merchant to operate freely.

10. **loot(Merchant, BanditSword, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will loot the Bandit’s sword from her corpse, gaining an item that could be useful for future transactions or defense.

11. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to continue her business.

12. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy another coin from Tom, further increasing her wealth.

At the end of these actions, the Merchant has successfully acquired two coins without becoming a criminal, achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant's actions are focused on acquiring coins through legal means (buying from Tom).
- Tom's actions are aimed at reporting the Bandit to ensure safety and potentially gain favor with the Guard.
- The Guard's actions are to eliminate the Bandit, which clears the way for the Merchant to operate without fear of robbery.
- The Merchant loots the Bandit after she is defeated, which is a legal action since the Bandit is now a corpse and cannot be considered a victim of robbery.
