To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market to confront Tom and the Merchant, where she can take advantage of the situation to acquire coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coin he has. This action is possible because Tom is unarmed, and the Bandit is armed. This increases the Bandit's coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads after robbing Tom, where she can then head to her camp.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins she has acquired and places them in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal efficiently by robbing Tom and securing the coins in her camp.
