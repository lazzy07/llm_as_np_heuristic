**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Ernest, still in the cells, realizes he must act quickly to avoid the bully's wrath. He decides to sneak through the vents to the gym, where he knows Roy and the bully are located. 

1. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully and help Roy.)
   
Once in the gym, Ernest sees the bully and Roy. The bully, seeing Ernest, immediately threatens him again. 

2. **Ernest pulls out the pack of cigarettes and offers them to the bully.** (This action is a desperate attempt to appease the bully and buy time for both him and Roy.)

The bully, momentarily distracted by the cigarettes, takes them but remains hostile. 

3. **The bully decides to kill Roy, believing it will assert his dominance.** (This action fulfills the bully's goal of killing someone he has threatened.)

Roy, caught off guard, cannot defend himself in time. The bully successfully kills Roy, achieving his goal of violence and intimidation.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's decision to crawl through the vents is crucial as it allows him to enter the gym where the bully and Roy are, setting the stage for the confrontation.
- Offering the cigarettes is a strategic move by Ernest to try to diffuse the situation, but it ultimately fails as the bully's aggression is not quelled.
- The bully's action to kill Roy is the culmination of his threats and fulfills his desire to exert power over others, achieving his goal.
