Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that she needs to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. With a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, so she decides to admit Jones to Patient Room A first, which will reduce her workload to 2. 

1. **Admit Jones to Patient Room A**: This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess him. It also reduces Hathaway's workload, lowering the risk of making a mistake.

Next, Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to assess Jones.

2. **Walk from Patient Room B to Patient Room A**: This action is required for Hathaway to be in the same room as Jones to assess his symptoms.

Once in Patient Room A, Hathaway assesses Jones.

3. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: This action allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway will not know what disease he has yet.

After assessing Jones, Hathaway realizes she needs to treat him, but she must first admit and assess the other patients to ensure they are healthy.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess him next.

5. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess him as well.

Now, Hathaway has admitted all patients and can assess them one by one to ensure they receive the correct treatment.

In this story, Hathaway successfully admits and prepares to assess all patients, which is essential for her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
