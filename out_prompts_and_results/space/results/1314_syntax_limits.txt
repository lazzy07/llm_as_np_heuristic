Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, where they have just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. The surface is currently dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

To achieve this, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, which is a safe location. Although this action would typically make the Lizard angry, they have already established a peaceful relationship, so the Lizard understands Zoe's need for safety.

**Action:**
1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)** - This action is taken by Zoe to ensure her safety by moving to the spaceship, which is a secure location away from the dangers of the surface.

After Zoe teleports to the spaceship, the Lizard remains on the surface but understands that Zoe's action was necessary for her safety. The Lizard feels content knowing that they have made a friend in Zoe, and they can continue to build their friendship from a distance.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The teleportation action is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe. Since the surface is dangerous, moving to the spaceship allows her to avoid potential threats, while the established friendship with the Lizard ensures that there are no hard feelings about her leaving.
