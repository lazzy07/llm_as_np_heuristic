To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant**: The bandit, armed with a sword, will rob the merchant who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant, which is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins.

2. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp**: After robbing the merchant, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp, where she can secure the coins in her chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant**: This action is necessary because the bandit needs to acquire coins to achieve her goal. The merchant is not armed, making her an easy target for robbery.

2. **The bandit walks to the bandit camp**: This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the coins in her chest at the bandit camp, which is one of her goals.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "The bandit robs the merchant",
    "The bandit walks to the bandit camp"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins or having them in the chest at the bandit camp.
