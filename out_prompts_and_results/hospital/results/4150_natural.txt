**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to admit Young to an exam room. She admits Young to Exam Room A, which is currently assigned to Jones. This action increases her workload to 4, but she needs to act quickly.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Exam Room A to assess Jones. She assesses Jones and discovers that he is experiencing a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. She then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 3. She then walks to Exam Room B to assess Ross. Upon assessment, she finds that Ross is also experiencing a fever, mistakenly believing he has Flaze due to her high workload. She treats Ross with antibiotics, which unfortunately leads to his demise since he actually has Jarkis.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Young. She finds that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. She treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him.

In the end, Jones and Young are healthy, while Ross has died due to the misdiagnosis.
