To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room B to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway needs to be in the same room as Ross to treat him.

3. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with either antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms, similar to what was done for Ross.

5. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room C to Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to move to Young's location to treat him.

6. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication based on his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery.
