To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which fulfills his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going from the forest to the bank** allows Bubba to reach the location where the money is held.
- **Stealing the money** is the action that directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, which is his goal.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go from the forest to the bank",
    "steal the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money while confirming that Bambi is dead, as required by the story's constraints.
