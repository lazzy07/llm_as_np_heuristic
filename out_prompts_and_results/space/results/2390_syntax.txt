To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard take actions that lead to the volcano erupting, while also ensuring they become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will affect the characters.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: After the volcano begins to erupt, Zoe and the Lizard realize the danger they are in. They decide to put aside any differences and become friends, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to make friends and be safe.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action will finalize the eruption of the volcano, leading to the death of one of the characters. Since both characters are currently in the cave, they will be safe from the eruption.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety from the eruption. 

5. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, remains on the surface and is ultimately killed by the eruption.

The final sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the eruption, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their desire to connect with other creatures.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Completes the eruption, leading to the Lizard's demise.
- **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Ensures Zoe's safety, allowing her to escape the danger.
- **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: Represents the consequence of the eruption, resulting in the Lizard's death.
