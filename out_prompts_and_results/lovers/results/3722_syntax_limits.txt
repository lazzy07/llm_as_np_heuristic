In the current situation, Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1) they wanted. However, Casey (C3) is unhappy because they want the flowers (I3), and Blake (C2) is also unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2). To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of making Casey happy, Alex can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the flowers (I3) that Casey wants. This action will make Casey happy, as they will receive the flowers they desire.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Alex (C1) sees that Casey (C3) is unhappy and wants to help. They know that Casey wants the flowers (I3).
- Alex decides to trade their jewelry (I1) for the flowers (I3) that Casey wants. This action is beneficial because it directly addresses Casey's desire, making them happy.

After this trade, the situation will be:

- Alex (C1) will be unhappy because they no longer have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C3) will be happy because they now have the flowers (I3).
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy because they still want the chocolates (I2).

However, since Alex's goal was to make Casey happy, they have successfully achieved that goal.
