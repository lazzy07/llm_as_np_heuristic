The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her criminal activities, she decides to take action. The bandit approaches the guard and attacks him, successfully killing him. With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now safely loot the guard's sword and any coins he may have had. 

Now that the guard is dead, the bandit can freely take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp without fear of being caught. She walks back to the bandit camp, where she retrieves the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the guard**: The bandit needs to eliminate the guard to ensure her safety and freedom to carry out her criminal activities without being pursued.
2. **Loot the guard's items**: This action is not explicitly mentioned in the final plan but is implied as a necessary step after the guard is dead. The bandit would take any coins or items that could help her.
3. **Walk to the bandit camp**: The bandit needs to return to her camp to collect the coins from the chest, which is essential for achieving her goal.
