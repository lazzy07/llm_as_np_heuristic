To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to focus on the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The current situation shows that Casey is not happy, and they want to make Blake happy as well. Since Blake is currently in the same room as Casey and has the item that Casey wants, the best action for Casey to take is to trade with Blake.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Alex for the chocolates (I2) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy since they wanted to make Alex happy, and Alex is now happy with the chocolates.

### Explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry. It also indirectly helps Blake, as they will be happy with the chocolates.
