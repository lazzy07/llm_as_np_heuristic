**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores, Roy decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is a threat, especially since he has already threatened both of them. 

1. **Action: Go to the Hallway (Roy)**  
   Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway. This action is necessary for him to access the gym and potentially lock the bully inside.

2. **Action: Lock the Gym (Roy)**  
   Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door. This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can deal with the threat without interference.

3. **Action: Vent (Roy, Gym)**  
   Roy crawls through the vents to the gym. This allows him to confront the bully directly without being seen by the guards.

4. **Action: Kill the Bully (Roy, Gym)**  
   In the gym, Roy uses the knife he stole earlier to kill the bully. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Ernest.

5. **Action: Disguise (Roy, Clothes, Hallway)**  
   After dealing with the bully, Roy returns to the hallway and puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. This disguise will help him avoid detection by the guards.

6. **Action: Escape (Roy, Highway)**  
   Finally, Roy makes his way to the highway and escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at eliminating the threat posed by the bully and ensuring his own survival. 
- Moving to the hallway and locking the gym is a strategic move to isolate the bully. 
- Crawling through the vents allows for a stealthy approach, and killing the bully is a necessary action to remove the danger.
- Disguising himself and escaping are the final steps to ensure he is no longer in the prison and can live freely.
