In the bank, the Hero, having just stolen the money, is now in a position of power over the Villain, who had previously threatened them. The Hero knows that the Villain intends to control the President using the money, which poses a significant threat. To prevent this, the Hero decides to take decisive action.

1. **Bribe the Villain**: The Hero uses the stolen money to bribe the Villain, ensuring that the Villain will no longer attempt to control the President. By giving the money to the Villain, the Hero gains control over them, effectively neutralizing the threat.
