**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that there are still patients in the admissions room, decides to admit Jones to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C to assess Jones. Since Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway proceeds to assess Jones anyway. 

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones is actually experiencing an unknown condition. As a result, Jones dies.

Dr. Hathaway then returns to Patient Room A to assess Young. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Upon assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Again, with a workload of 1, Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics as well, successfully curing Ross.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has treated Young and Ross successfully, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
