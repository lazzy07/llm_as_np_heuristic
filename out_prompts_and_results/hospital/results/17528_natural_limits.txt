Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high and they need to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to the high workload, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Dr. Hathaway believes Young is alive and healthy. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway determines that Young has Flaze due to the fever symptom.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy as a result of the treatment.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess and admit Jones and Ross, who are still waiting. 

By assessing Young first, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats one patient, reducing their workload and ensuring that at least one patient is healthy. The next step to admit and assess the other patients is set in motion, but the immediate goal of treating Young is achieved.
