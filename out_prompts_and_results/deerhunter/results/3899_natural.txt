To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure his goal of having money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger. Since Bambi is already dead, this action is valid and helps Bubba fulfill his need.
   
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to interact with the clerk and potentially get more money.

3. **Bubba decides to get money from the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and since the clerk has 0 money, he will need to take action to acquire it.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk at gunpoint.** - This action is essential as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money. The clerk is at the bank, and Bubba can use the rifle to intimidate the clerk into giving him money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, and Bambi will remain dead, fulfilling the conditions of the story.
