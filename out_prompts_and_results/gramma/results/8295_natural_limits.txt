The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the guard is present. The bandit then reports her own location to the guard, effectively drawing his attention away from the crossroads. This allows the merchant to be distracted, giving the bandit the opportunity to sneak back to the crossroads and steal the medicine from the merchant.
