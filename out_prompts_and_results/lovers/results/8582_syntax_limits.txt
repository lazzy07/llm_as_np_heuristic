In the current situation, all characters are in the living room (R21), and none of them are happy. Casey wants the jewelry (I3), which is currently with Alex (C1). To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Blake (C2) to tell Casey (C3) that Alex wants the flowers (I1), which is a lie, but it will prompt Casey to act.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers. This action is necessary because it misleads Casey into thinking that Alex is not interested in the jewelry, which may prompt Casey to take action to get the jewelry for themselves.

After this action, Casey can then strategize to get the jewelry from Alex, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **tell(C2, C3, I1, R21)**: This action is included to create a misunderstanding that leads Casey to believe that Alex does not want the jewelry. This could motivate Casey to take further actions to obtain the jewelry, ultimately leading to their happiness.
