Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit, who is also armed, standing nearby. Knowing that he needs to get back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take action. 

Tom approaches the bandit and, using the sword he acquired, he attacks the bandit. The bandit, unprepared for the assault, is killed. Tom then loots the bandit's sword and any coins the bandit might have had, but his primary goal is to ensure he can safely return to the cottage with the medicine.

With the bandit defeated, Tom walks back to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

3. **Walk to the cottage**: This is the final action that fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
