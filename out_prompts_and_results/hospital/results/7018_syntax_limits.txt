**Story Completion:**

After assessing Ross in Exam Room B, Hathaway realizes that Ross is showing symptoms of Flaze, as indicated by SymptomA (fever). To ensure Ross's health, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze.

Next, Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to admit Young, who is still waiting there. Hathaway assigns Young to Exam Room C, where he can be assessed later.
