In the current situation, Alex (C1) is in the living room (R21) and wants the flowers (I1) that are in the dining room (R22). Casey (C3) is also in the living room (R21) and has the chocolates (I2) that Alex wants. Blake (C2) is in the dining room (R22) and has the jewelry (I3) that Casey wants. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the following action can be taken:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) to pick up the flowers (I1).

This action is necessary because it allows Alex to access the flowers, which is the item they want to achieve happiness. 

After this action, the situation will be:

- Alex will be in the dining room (R22) and will pick up the flowers (I1), making Alex happy.
- Casey and Blake will still be in their respective locations, but Alex's goal will be achieved.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["move(C1, R21, R22)"]
}
``` 

This is the shortest story where Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers they desire.
