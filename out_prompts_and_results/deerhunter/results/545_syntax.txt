To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba returns to the forest with the money. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides closure to the story by showing Bubba leaving the bank.

The actions are designed to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money by eliminating the only obstacle (the bank clerk) who possesses it.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the clerk, ensuring that he can take the money without resistance.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba picks up the money from the bank, achieving the goal of having the money.
4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba leaves the bank, concluding the story.
