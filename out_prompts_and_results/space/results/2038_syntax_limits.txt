In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet after the surface has become uninhabitable due to a volcanic eruption. They are not currently fighting, but their relationship is strained. To achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**  
This action is taken because Zoe wants to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which aligns with both of their goals of making friends and being safe. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the dangers posed by the erupting volcano.

After making peace, the Lizard and Zoe can now cooperate, but the volcano on the surface is still erupting, which poses a threat to their safety. However, since the story requires a character to die, we can assume that the eruption continues and eventually leads to a fatal outcome for one of them.

**Action: erupt(Surface)**  
This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting, which results in a character dying. Since the surface is already uninhabitable, the eruption signifies the finality of the danger posed by the volcano.

In this scenario, Zoe and the Lizard make peace, but the eruption ultimately leads to Zoe's demise, fulfilling the story's requirements.
