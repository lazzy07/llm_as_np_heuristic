In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp, while the Bandit and the Guard are at the Market. The Bandit has just attacked Tom, who is now dead, and the Merchant has a sword, which allows her to take action without fear of being attacked.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Loot**: The Merchant can loot Tom's corpse to acquire the coins he was carrying. Since Tom is dead, the Merchant can take the coins without any repercussions.
