To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market and head towards the cottage.

2. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action allows Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Walking from the market to the crossroads** is essential because Tom needs to exit the market where he currently is. The crossroads is the only path leading to the cottage.
  
- **Walking from the crossroads to the cottage** is the final step that allows Tom to reach his goal of being at the cottage.

Since Tom has already looted the medicine from the merchant, he is now carrying it as he walks to the cottage.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
