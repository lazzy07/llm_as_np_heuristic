Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk, who has the money he desires. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to threaten the clerk.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to confront the clerk to get the money.)
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Loading the ammunition into the rifle** is crucial for Bubba to have the power to intimidate or threaten the clerk.
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk directly, as the clerk is not in the forest.
- **Stealing the money** is the final action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
