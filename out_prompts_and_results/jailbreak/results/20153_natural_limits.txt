As the first day in the prison continued, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realized he needed to act quickly. He had no weapon and was at the mercy of the bully. However, he remembered that the knife was in the kitchen. 

Roy decided to take a risk. He crawled through the vents from the gym to the kitchen, hoping to retrieve the knife. Once in the kitchen, he quickly grabbed the knife and returned through the vents to the gym.
