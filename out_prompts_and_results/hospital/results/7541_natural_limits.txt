**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (Dr. Hathaway needs to admit Jones and Ross to exam rooms to assess their conditions.)
2. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B. (This action assigns Jones to an exam room, allowing for assessment and treatment.)
3. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A. (This action assigns Ross to an exam room, allowing for assessment and treatment.)
4. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. (Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Ross's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.)
5. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis. (Assuming Ross has the rash symptom of Jarkis, this treatment will make Ross healthy.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to move to Admissions to admit the patients, as they are currently in the admissions room.
- The second and third actions are crucial for assigning Jones and Ross to their respective exam rooms, which is a prerequisite for assessment and treatment.
- The fourth action is essential for Dr. Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms, which is necessary to ensure the correct treatment is administered.
- The fifth action is the treatment of Ross, which is aimed at achieving the goal of making the patients healthy. Since Young is already in Patient Room C and is alive, this action indirectly supports Young's goal of being healthy by ensuring that Ross is treated.
