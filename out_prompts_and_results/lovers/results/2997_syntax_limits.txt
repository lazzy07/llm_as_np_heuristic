In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I3 (the item in C2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve their goal.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the item I3 (which is currently with Casey) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (I3). Since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, Blake also achieves their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate the next action.
- **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: This action directly satisfies Alex's desire for I3, thus making Alex happy and fulfilling Blake's goal.
