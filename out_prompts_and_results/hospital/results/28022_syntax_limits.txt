**Story Completion:**

After admitting Young to Exam Room B, Hathaway returns to the admissions room to assess the patients. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. Since Ross is the only patient in that room, Hathaway checks for symptoms. Ross shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes he is healthy.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then walks to Exam Room B to assess Young. Young also shows no symptoms, leading Hathaway to believe he is healthy as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Since Ross is healthy, Hathaway does not need to treat him, but he can confirm his health status.

4. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment for his condition, which is unnecessary since Young shows no symptoms, but it confirms Hathaway's commitment to ensuring all patients are healthy.

By assessing both patients and confirming their health, Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
