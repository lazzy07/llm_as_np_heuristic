To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and go to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After dealing with the clerk, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located and eat her. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the condition of the story.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk and also results in Bambi being dead, thus satisfying both conditions of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk by force, as he has a loaded gun.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
