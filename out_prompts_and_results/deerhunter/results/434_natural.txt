To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and has a loaded rifle. Shooting Bambi will allow him to eat, fulfilling his hunger.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions we need to fulfill.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to go to the bank to potentially interact with the bank clerk and acquire the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that either Bambi is dead (which satisfies one condition) and Bubba ends up with the money (which satisfies the other condition).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Deciding to shoot Bambi**: Bubba's hunger drives him to consider shooting Bambi, as he needs food.
- **Shooting Bambi**: This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead.
- **Deciding to eat Bambi**: After killing Bambi, Bubba can eat, which satisfies his hunger.
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to interact with the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.
