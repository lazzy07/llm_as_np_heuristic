To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene after committing the theft.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will shoot Bambi, who is in the forest. This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead, which is one of the possible endings.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
