Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. By assessing, Hathaway can identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis and provide the appropriate treatment.

   - This action will help Hathaway determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze or Jarkis based on symptoms.**
