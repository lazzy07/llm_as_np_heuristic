**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is in the admissions room with Ross and Jones. Since both patients are in the same room, Hathaway decides to assess them to determine their symptoms.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A. Since Ross has not shown any symptoms yet, Hathaway believes he is healthy.
   
2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Jones also shows no symptoms, leading Hathaway to believe he is healthy as well.

3. **Admit Young**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room B, as Young is still in the admissions room and needs to be seen.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B. Young shows no symptoms, and Hathaway believes he is healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Since Hathaway believes Ross is healthy, he treats him with antibiotics, which is unnecessary but does not harm him.

6. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics as well, believing he is healthy.

7. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing he is healthy.

All patients are treated with antibiotics, and since they showed no symptoms of Flaze or Jarkis, they remain alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assessing Ross and Jones**: This is crucial to determine their health status and ensure Hathaway can make informed treatment decisions.
- **Admitting Young**: This is necessary to ensure all patients are seen and treated.
- **Assessing Young**: This confirms Young's health status.
- **Treating all patients with antibiotics**: Although unnecessary, it does not harm them, and since they are healthy, they remain alive.
