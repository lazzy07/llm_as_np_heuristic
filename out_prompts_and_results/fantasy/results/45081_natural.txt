To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to be in the same location as Vince, who has the money. Rory needs to be at the village to interact with Vince.

2. **Rory takes the money from Vince.**  
   - This action allows Rory to acquire the money that Vince has, which is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

3. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to Rory, this action is redundant but can be seen as reaffirming their bond. However, it does not affect the outcome since they are already married.

4. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action is also redundant since they are already married, but it reinforces their commitment to each other.

5. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action is unnecessary as they are already married, but it can be viewed as a celebration of their relationship.

6. **Rory becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is included to show that Rory's hunger status can change, but it does not affect the outcome since Rory's goal is to be wealthy and happy.

7. **Rory eats.**  
   - This action allows Rory to satisfy their hunger, ensuring they are not hungry anymore.

By following these actions, Rory achieves their goal of being happy (through marriage), wealthy (by taking the money), and not hungry (by eating).
