Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads, aware that the bandit is nearby. The bandit, also at the crossroads, sees an opportunity to rob Tom. However, Tom, being unarmed, cannot defend himself. 

To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take a risk. He quickly reports the bandit’s location to the guard, who is still at the market. The guard, upon receiving the information, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

Once the guard arrives at the crossroads, he sees the bandit and, armed with his sword, he attacks and kills her. With the bandit defeated, Tom is now safe to walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine.

This action sequence is necessary because Tom needs to ensure his safety to achieve his goal of returning to the cottage with the medicine. Reporting the bandit to the guard is the only action that allows Tom to avoid confrontation and successfully complete his objective.
