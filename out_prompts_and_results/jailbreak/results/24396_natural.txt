1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where the bully is and to potentially help Ernest.)
   
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Roy prevents the bully from leaving and ensures that he can confront him without the risk of being attacked.)

3. **Roy enters the gym with the knife.** (This action allows Roy to confront the bully directly, as he has the means to defend himself and protect Ernest.)

4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the critical action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing them to feel safe.)

5. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (After dealing with the bully, Roy needs to regroup and plan his next move.)

6. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This action is necessary for Roy to disguise himself and prepare for an escape.)

7. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows Roy to escape the prison without being detected.)

8. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This final action achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's safety from the bully, who poses a direct threat to their lives.
