To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to his happiness through marriage with Talia, while also ensuring he retains his wealth and does not become hungry. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village to be with Talia, as they have already accepted each other's proposal. This is necessary for Rory to be with Talia and to fulfill the marriage requirement.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married in the village. This action makes both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

3. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels back to the cave to be with Rory again, ensuring they are together after their marriage.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry, which is a necessary step to ensure he can eat and not remain hungry.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story, but it ultimately leads to Rory's demise, which is a necessary plot twist to ensure the story concludes.

In this story, Rory achieves his goal of happiness through marriage with Talia, and while he does not survive, the actions taken lead to the fulfillment of his desires before his demise.
