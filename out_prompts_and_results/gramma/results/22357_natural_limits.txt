**Story Completion:**

The merchant, realizing that she needs to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to take a calculated risk. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is stationed. 

Once at the market, she approaches the guard and reports the location of the bandit at the camp. This action is strategic because it not only helps the guard fulfill his goal of eliminating criminals but also positions the merchant as a helpful citizen, ensuring she remains within the law. 

The guard, upon receiving this information, rushes to the bandit camp to confront the bandit. This action indirectly benefits the merchant, as the bandit is now distracted and unable to steal from her or interfere with her business.

With the bandit occupied, the merchant can now safely sell her items and collect more coins without the threat of criminal activity nearby.

1. **Merchant walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the merchant to interact with the guard and report the bandit, which is crucial for her goal of acquiring more coins.
2. **Merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard**: This action helps the guard fulfill his duty and keeps the merchant safe from potential robbery, allowing her to continue her business without fear.
