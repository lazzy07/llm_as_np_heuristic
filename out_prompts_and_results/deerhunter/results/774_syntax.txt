To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, he is greedy, and he has a rifle and ammunition. The bank clerk is also at the bank, and he has some money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene after committing the theft.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Ensures Bubba escapes after achieving his goal.
