**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that both Ross and Young are still in the admissions room, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, Hathaway knows that Jones is alive and must treat him. Therefore, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This action is risky due to the unknown symptoms, but it is necessary to attempt to help Jones.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Again, Ross's symptoms are unknown, but Hathaway treats him with steroids, assuming he might have Jarkis. This is another risky move, but it is essential to try to help Ross.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. Young's symptoms are also unknown, but Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This is the last attempt to ensure all patients receive treatment.

In the end, all patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy is achieved, despite the risks taken due to unknown symptoms.
