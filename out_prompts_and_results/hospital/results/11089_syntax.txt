To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Young might have in order to treat them correctly.

2. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Young.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (the fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
