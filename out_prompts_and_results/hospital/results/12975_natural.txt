**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess the patient to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is crucial to attempt to make Ross healthy. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will recover; if not, he may not survive.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones next, as he is still in Admissions. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to identify Jones's symptoms. Again, due to the workload, there is a risk of error, but it is essential to proceed.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis, this action is necessary to attempt to make Jones healthy. If Jones actually has Jarkis, he will recover; if not, he may not survive.

6. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young.**  
   - Finally, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is also in Admissions. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide treatment.

7. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms. Again, due to the workload, there is a risk of error, but it is essential to proceed.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis, this action is necessary to attempt to make Young healthy. If Young actually has Jarkis, he will recover; if not, he may not survive.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to assess and treat the patients, which is the primary goal of Dr. Hathaway. The risk of making mistakes due to high workload is acknowledged, but the actions are necessary to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated in a timely manner. The story ends with the hope that all patients will be treated correctly, leading to their health.
