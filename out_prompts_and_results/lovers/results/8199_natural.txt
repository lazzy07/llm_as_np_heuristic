To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex, which is essential for Alex's happiness.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers they want, thus making Alex happy.

3. **Casey picks up the jewelry from Blake in the living room.**
