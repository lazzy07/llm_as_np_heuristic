Tom, now armed with the Merchant Sword and carrying the Medicine, stands at the Crossroads. He sees the Bandit nearby, who is also at the Crossroads. Knowing that the Bandit is a criminal and poses a threat, Tom decides to take action. He attacks the Bandit, using his sword to eliminate the threat.

After successfully defeating the Bandit, Tom loots the Bandit's corpse, taking the coins that the Bandit had. With the Bandit out of the way and the coins in his possession, Tom can now safely walk back to the Cottage, fulfilling his goal of being at the Cottage while carrying the Medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **attack(Tom, Bandit, Crossroads)**: Tom attacks the Bandit to eliminate the threat, as the Bandit is a criminal and could potentially harm him or interfere with his goal.
2. **loot(Tom, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After defeating the Bandit, Tom loots the coins from the Bandit's corpse, which helps him gain more resources.
3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks back to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being there while carrying the Medicine.
