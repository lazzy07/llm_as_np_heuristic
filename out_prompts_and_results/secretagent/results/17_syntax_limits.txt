The Secret Agent is in the Office, holding both the Papers and the Gun. The goal is to eliminate the Mastermind, who is also in the Office. 

To achieve this, the Secret Agent will take the following actions:

1. **Kill the Mastermind**: The Secret Agent uses the Gun to kill the Mastermind in the Office. This action directly fulfills the Secret Agent's goal of ensuring the Mastermind is dead.

This is the shortest and most efficient way to achieve the Secret Agent's goal, as it requires only one action after reaching the Office.

Here’s the complete story:

The Secret Agent, having successfully navigated through the Dropbox and the Courtyard, arrives at the Office with the Papers and the Gun in hand. Knowing that the Mastermind is also present, the Secret Agent takes a decisive action and kills the Mastermind with the Gun.

The Mastermind is now dead, and the Secret Agent has achieved their goal.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
