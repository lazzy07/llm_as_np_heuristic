**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing the urgency of the situation, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones, Ross, and Young, who are all in the admissions room, to assess their conditions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - This action is crucial to identify Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similar to Jones, assessing Ross is necessary to identify his symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - Assessing Young is also essential to determine his symptoms and provide appropriate care.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - If Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 0 after assessing all patients, he can treat Jones correctly.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.**  
   - If Ross has Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy. Dr. Hathaway can now treat Ross correctly as well.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - If Young has Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy. Dr. Hathaway can treat Young correctly since his workload is now manageable.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first four actions (walking to admissions and assessing each patient) are necessary to gather information about the patients' symptoms, which is critical for providing the correct treatment.
- The last three actions (treating each patient) are essential to ensure that all patients receive the appropriate treatment based on their diagnosed conditions.
