To achieve Blake's goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (Casey believes the chocolates are in the bathroom and wants to check for them.)
2. **Casey picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.** (Casey finds the chocolates and now has them.)
3. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Casey wants to be in the same room as Blake to give him the chocolates.)
4. **Casey gives the chocolates to Blake.** (This action allows Blake to obtain the chocolates, making him happy.)

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom:** This action is necessary because Casey believes the chocolates are in the bathroom and needs to check there to find them.
- **Casey picks up the chocolates in the bathroom:** This action is crucial as it allows Casey to acquire the chocolates, which is what Blake wants.
