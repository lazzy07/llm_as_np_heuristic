To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, which means she is on her way to happiness. However, she still needs to acquire wealth. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the Cave to the Village. This is necessary because Rory needs to be in the same location as Talia to interact with her and help her achieve her goal.

2. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels from the Village to the Cave. This is necessary because Gargax is interested in the treasure located in the Cave, and his absence from the Village will allow Talia to take the money without interference.

3. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial because it allows Talia to become wealthy, which is one of her goals.

4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action ensures that Talia achieves happiness, as she is now married to Vince, who she accepted a proposal from.

At this point, Talia has achieved both her goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by taking the money).
