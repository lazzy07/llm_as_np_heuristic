Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action. She knows that the Lizard is at the surface and is not safe. To help the Lizard and potentially make a friend, Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface. This action is crucial because it allows her to confront the Lizard directly and offer assistance, which could lead to a friendship.

Upon arriving at the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard struggling with the volcanic activity. Instead of fighting, she extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together to escape the danger. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions and realizing they share the same goal of safety, accepts her offer. They both agree to help each other, thus forming a friendship.

However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts violently, catching them both off guard. The eruption is sudden and powerful, and unfortunately, the Lizard is unable to escape in time, leading to its demise. 

This story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying (the Lizard), and two characters making friends (Zoe and the Lizard).
