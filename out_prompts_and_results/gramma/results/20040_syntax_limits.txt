To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. Since he has already robbed the medicine from the merchant and is armed with a sword, he can safely walk to the Cottage without any threats.

This single action allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it directly moves Tom from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be while carrying the medicine. There are no threats or obstacles in this action, making it the most efficient way for Tom to achieve his goal.
