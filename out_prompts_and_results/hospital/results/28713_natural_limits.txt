Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is showing a rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis and administers steroids. This treatment is successful, and Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to an exam room. Since Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway assigns him to Patient Room B.
