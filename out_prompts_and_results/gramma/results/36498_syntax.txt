To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market where Tom is located. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to confront Tom to rob him of the coin he has.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of the coin he has. This action is crucial for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads. This is necessary to position herself for the next step.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action allows the Bandit to maximize her coin collection.

At the end of these actions, the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
