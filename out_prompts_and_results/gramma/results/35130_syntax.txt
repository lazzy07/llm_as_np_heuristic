To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without needing to go to the market or engage in more complex actions.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, having just attacked the Guard, sees Tom at the Crossroads. She decides to rob him of the coin he is carrying, which is a straightforward action since Tom is unarmed.
- With the coin now in her possession, the Bandit walks to the bandit camp, where she can store the coin in the chest, thus achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for the Bandit to achieve her goal.
