Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the dangerous surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent threat posed by the volcano. They have successfully made peace and become friends, but their safety is still at risk. To ensure their health and safety, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the dangerous surface, where the volcano could erupt at any moment. By teleporting to the spaceship, Zoe can ensure her own safety.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** After reaching the safety of the spaceship, Zoe realizes that she cannot leave the Lizard behind in danger. She teleports back to the surface to help her new friend.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** Together, they walk to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface. This action allows both characters to find refuge from the potential eruption of the volcano.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave.** They decide to stay in the cave until the danger from the volcano passes. This action ensures that both characters remain safe and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also ensuring that the Lizard is safe and healthy. They have successfully formed a friendship and found refuge together.
