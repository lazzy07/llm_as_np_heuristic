To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **Bubba points the rifle at the clerk.**  
   - This action is implied as a necessary step to intimidate the clerk into giving up the money. It is not explicitly listed in the actions but is essential for the next step.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to leave the bank with the stolen money and return to a safer location.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** is essential for Bubba to interact with the clerk and attempt to get the money.
- **Pointing the rifle** (implied) is necessary to create a situation where the clerk feels threatened enough to comply with Bubba's demands.
- **Stealing the money** is the direct action that fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
- **Returning to the forest** allows Bubba to escape with the money and ensures he is no longer in a potentially dangerous situation.
