In the cave, Rory has already proposed to Talia, and both Vince and Rory are interested in her. To achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, Rory needs to secure Talia's acceptance of his proposal and ensure he has enough wealth.

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village with Talia, where they can enjoy their happiness together and Rory can also ensure he is not hungry.

This sequence of actions allows Rory to achieve his goal of happiness while also being wealthy and not hungry, as he has the treasure and can access food in the village.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
