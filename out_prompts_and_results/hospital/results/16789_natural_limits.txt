Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: After identifying that Ross has Jarkis, Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Ross's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess and treat Jones and Young. This action is necessary to continue the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Ross, and upon reaching Admissions, can continue to assess and treat the other patients, ultimately achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
