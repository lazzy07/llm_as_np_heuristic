In this story, Gargax the dragon is hungry and desires wealth. After eating both Talia and Vince, Gargax finds himself in the Village where he sees that Vince had some money. Since Vince is now dead, Gargax can take the money from Vince's body.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action fulfills Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy, as he now possesses the money.
