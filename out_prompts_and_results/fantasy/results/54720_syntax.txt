To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels to the Cave where the Treasure is located. This is necessary for Gargax to access the Treasure, which will help fulfill their goal of wealth.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax picks up the Treasure in the Cave. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry. This action is included to reflect Gargax's state, as they need to be hungry to justify the next action.

4. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia, who is in the Cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Gargax does not care about the happiness of others and needs to ensure they are not hungry.
