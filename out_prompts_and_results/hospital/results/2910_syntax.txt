To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C. This is also necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Walk Young from Admissions to Exam Room B**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will need to admit Young to an exam room. We will assume that Young is assigned to Exam Room B, which is currently unoccupied.

4. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
