Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, returns to the Admissions room and admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2. Next, Hathaway assesses Ross, discovering he is experiencing an unknown symptom. Since Hathaway's workload is still below 3, he can accurately diagnose Ross.
