To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the bandit camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary because the bandit needs to be in a position to interact with the other characters and potentially rob them.

2. **The bandit reports her location to the guard.**  
   - The bandit believes the guard is at the crossroads, and by reporting her location, she can create a distraction or confusion, allowing her to potentially steal from the merchant later.

3. **The guard walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The guard believes the merchant has the medicine and is at the market. This action is necessary for the guard to confront the merchant.

4. **The bandit robs the merchant.**  
   - The bandit, now at the market, uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the hero's coin. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

5. **The bandit walks back to the bandit camp.**  
   - After robbing the merchant, the bandit returns to her camp to secure her loot.

6. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The merchant needs to move to a location where she can potentially sell her goods or find other opportunities to earn coins.

7. **The merchant buys a sword from the guard using the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to acquire a weapon, which can help her defend herself in the future and potentially earn more coins by selling items.

At the end of these actions, the merchant has successfully acquired a coin and a sword, achieving her goal of maximizing her coins without becoming a criminal.
