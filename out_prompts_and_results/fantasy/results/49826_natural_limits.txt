In the cave, Talia and Rory are married, but Talia is unhappy and has no wealth. Rory, who has the treasure, is also unhappy. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and sees an opportunity. 

1. Gargax eats Rory. This action is necessary because it removes Rory from the story, allowing Talia to take the treasure without any competition. Rory's death means Talia can now access the treasure he was holding.
