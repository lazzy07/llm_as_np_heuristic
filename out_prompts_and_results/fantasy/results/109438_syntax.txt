To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory's happiness and wealth while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village to find a way to secure his happiness and wealth. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be in a location where he can interact with Talia and Vince to achieve his goals.

2. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money that Vince has. This action is crucial as it increases Rory's wealth, bringing him closer to his goal of being wealthy.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. This action is important because it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness and also makes Rory happy, as he has now achieved a relationship goal.

4. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the cave with Talia. This action is necessary to reunite with Vince and Gargax, ensuring that all characters are together for the next steps.

5. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to remove Vince from the story, as he does not care about wealth and is not essential for Rory's happiness and wealth.

6. **take(Rory, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Rory takes the treasure from himself. This action is included to ensure that Rory has both the treasure and the money, solidifying his wealth.

At this point, Rory has achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage) and wealthy (by acquiring both money and treasure). He is also not hungry, as there are no actions that would lead to hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to the village** allows Rory to access the money and interact with Talia.
- **Picking up the money** increases Rory's wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
- **Marrying Talia** fulfills both characters' desires for happiness, thus making Rory happy.
- **Traveling back to the cave** keeps the story within the defined locations and allows for the next actions to take place.
- **Eating Vince** is a necessary action to remove a character who does not contribute to Rory's goals.
- **Taking the treasure** ensures Rory has both items needed to achieve his wealth goal.
