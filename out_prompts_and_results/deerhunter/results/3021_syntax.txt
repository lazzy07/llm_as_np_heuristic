To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has just shot Bambi, and is hungry. He also has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank, and Bubba believes the clerk is alive and has money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only character with money, and Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he will steal the money from the clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba has a loaded gun, which allows him to intimidate the clerk and take the money without a fight.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and he needs to address his hunger after the confrontation.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to satisfy his hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to steal money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger and decides to eat.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
