To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has accepted proposals from both Vince and Rory, she can marry one of them, which will make her happy. Additionally, Vince currently has money, which can contribute to her wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which makes her happy. This is essential because Talia's goal is to be happy, and marrying Vince fulfills that requirement.

2. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: After marrying, Vince travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Vince to access the treasure, which can contribute to Talia's wealth.

3. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. This is important because it adds to the wealth that Talia desires.

4. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince returns to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary to bring the treasure back to Talia.

5. **give(Vince, Talia, Treasure, Village)**: Vince gives the treasure to Talia. This action is implied as it is necessary for Talia to have the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.
