To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the shortest story that meets the criteria:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money, and since he has a loaded rifle, he can steal from the clerk.)

This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money without needing to go through additional steps or locations. The story is already set up for this action since Bubba has the rifle loaded and is in a position to confront the clerk.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk:** This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and wants money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money, thus achieving his goal of having at least 1 money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk."]
}
``` 

This plan succinctly captures the necessary action to ensure Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
