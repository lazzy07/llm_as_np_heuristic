**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Roy decides to take action to protect both himself and Ernest from the bully. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife. 

1. **Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where the bully is located.)
   
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to sneak into the gym without being seen by the bully.)

3. **Roy locks the gym door behind him.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that Roy can confront him without interference.)

4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the final action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully, allowing Roy to achieve his goal of staying alive and protecting his friend.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to Ernest without fear of being threatened.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the hallway is essential for Roy to reach the gym.
- Crawling through the vents allows for stealthy access to the gym, avoiding any confrontation with the bully until Roy is ready.
- Locking the gym door secures the environment, ensuring that the bully cannot escape or call for help.
- Killing the bully eliminates the threat, allowing Roy to feel safe and ultimately achieve his goal of survival.
