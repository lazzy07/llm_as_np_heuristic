To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is crucial for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room, to determine their symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure they become healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms.
