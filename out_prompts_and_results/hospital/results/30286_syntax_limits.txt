In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in PatientRoomC with Jones, who is a patient. Ross is in Admissions, and Young is also in Admissions. Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient without reducing their workload first.

To achieve the goal efficiently, Hathaway will first assess Jones to determine their symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient in the room, this action is necessary to identify the correct treatment. After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary to determine what disease Jones has, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment. 
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

By following this plan, Hathaway can ensure that Jones is treated correctly, thus achieving their goal of having all patients healthy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
