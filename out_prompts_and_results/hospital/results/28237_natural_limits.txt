Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds with the assessment. After assessing Jones, she mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. She treats Jones with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for his unknown condition. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, he survives the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to an exam room. She assigns Young to Patient Room A, where Ross is currently located. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. With a reduced workload of 2 after treating Jones, she correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
