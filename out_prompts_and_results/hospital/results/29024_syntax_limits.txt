To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine if he has any symptoms. This is necessary because Jones is currently unassigned to an exam room, and Hathaway needs to know if he has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Jones based on the symptoms identified during the assessment.

3. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones in Exam Room B with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are healthy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Jones**: This action is essential to identify Jones's symptoms, which will inform the treatment decision.
- **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: This action allows Hathaway to manage Jones's care effectively by assigning him to a room where he can be treated.
- **Treat Jones**: This action is the final step to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment and becomes healthy.

### JSON Object with Final Plan:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomJ, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Jones, ExamRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, TreatmentJ, ExamRoomB)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, "SymptomJ" and "TreatmentJ" would be replaced with the actual symptom and treatment based on the assessment results. This ensures that the story remains concise while achieving the desired outcome.
