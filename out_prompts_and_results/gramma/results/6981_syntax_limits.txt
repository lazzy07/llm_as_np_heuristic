To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, we can follow these actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action directly moves him to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is at the Cottage and needs to move to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to set up the next action where the Bandit can confront Tom.

3. **report(Bandit, Cottage, Market)**: The Bandit reports her location to the Guard, who is at the Market. This action is included to create a distraction, allowing Tom to safely take the medicine without being attacked or robbed.

After these actions, Tom will be at the Cottage with the medicine, as the Bandit has moved away and the Guard is distracted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This is the primary action that fulfills Tom's goal of being at the Cottage.
- **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit is no longer at the Cottage, which prevents any potential conflict with Tom.
- **report(Bandit, Cottage, Market)**: This action serves to distract the Guard, ensuring that Tom can remain safe at the Cottage with the medicine.
