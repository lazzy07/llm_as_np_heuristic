In the village, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, while Gargax, the dragon, is also there, feeling hungry. Since Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, she has the potential to gain happiness through her relationships. However, her current happiness is at 0, and she desires to be happy and wealthy.
