Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high, decides to prioritize the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary to reduce the number of patients in the admissions room and allows Hathaway to start assessing Jones. It also increases Hathaway's workload to 4, but since Jones is the next patient to be seen, it is essential to keep the process moving.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway will need to make a decision based on the assessment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** Assuming that Jones has Flaze (since the symptoms are unknown), Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones indeed has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway effectively manages the patients and ensures that at least one patient is treated successfully.
