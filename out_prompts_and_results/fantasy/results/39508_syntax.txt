To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to secure wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which will help him achieve his goal of wealth. 

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave, increasing his wealth.

3. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the village with the treasure.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia, which makes both of them happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action is essential for Rory to reach the treasure, which is located in the cave. Without this action, he cannot obtain the treasure.
  
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Picking up the treasure is crucial for Rory to increase his wealth. Since wealth is one of his goals, this action directly contributes to achieving it.

- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to return to the village to be with Talia and to finalize his marriage, which is necessary for his happiness.

- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness through a committed relationship with Talia, thus achieving his goal of being happy.

At the end of these actions, Rory is wealthy (due to the treasure) and happy (due to marrying Talia), and he is not hungry since there are no actions that lead to hunger.
