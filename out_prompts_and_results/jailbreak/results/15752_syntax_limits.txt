**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, who is currently in the kitchen, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, Roy makes a bold decision. He moves to the hallway to get closer to the gym. 

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening either him or Ernest. With the bully locked away, Roy feels a sense of relief and safety. 

Now that the bully is contained, Roy can focus on his next steps. He decides to disguise himself in the civilian clothes he stole earlier. With the disguise on, he can safely make his way to the highway without fear of being recognized or threatened. 

Finally, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. Once outside, he puts on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise and successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
