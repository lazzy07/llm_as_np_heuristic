To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a different room to facilitate the next steps.

2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

3. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R21)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This action is crucial because it communicates Alex's desire to Casey, which may influence Casey's next actions.

4. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to join Alex and Casey. This is necessary for Blake to be part of the interaction and to help Alex achieve their goal.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

6. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear the space and may be relevant for future interactions.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have obtained the flowers, which is what they wanted.
