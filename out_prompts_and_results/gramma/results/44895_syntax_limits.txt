In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where she has just attacked the Guard, who is now dead. The Bandit can loot the Guard's corpse to take the Guard's sword, which will make her more powerful and allow her to carry out her plans more effectively.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Bandit, GuardSword, Guard, Market)**: The Bandit loots the dead Guard to take his sword. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to become armed, which is crucial for her to defend herself and potentially rob or attack others in the future.

After this action, the Bandit is now armed and can proceed to either rob Tom or take more coins from the chest at the bandit camp later.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Bandit loots the Guard to acquire the sword, which enhances her power and security. This is a strategic move to ensure she can defend herself and potentially take more coins from others or secure her position.
