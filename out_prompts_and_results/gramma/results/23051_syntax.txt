To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from Camp to Crossroads**: The Merchant needs to be at the Crossroads to interact with Tom, who is carrying the Medicine and has a coin.

2. **Merchant buys the Medicine from Tom**: The Merchant will use the coin she has to buy the Medicine from Tom. This action allows her to gain an item of value while also ensuring she does not engage in criminal activity.

3. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Camp**: After the transaction, the Merchant will return to her preferred location, the Camp.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without resorting to criminal behavior, as she only buys the Medicine from Tom.
