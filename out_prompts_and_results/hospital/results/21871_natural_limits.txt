Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses both Jones and Ross in Patient Room C. Since both patients are experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway must determine their conditions. 

1. **Assess Jones**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is in Patient Room C. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to the fever symptom associated with it. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3.

2. **Assess Ross**: Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also in Patient Room C. Due to the increased workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis, which is incorrect. 

3. **Treat Jones**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. This treatment is correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies.

5. **Admit Young**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room B, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and that Young can be assessed next.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving the goal of having at least one patient healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
