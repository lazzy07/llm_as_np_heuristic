To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a position to interact with the hero and the guard, as she needs to sell items to them to gain coins.

2. **The merchant sells the medicine to the hero for the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain a coin while providing the hero with the medicine he desires. The merchant is not committing a crime, as she is selling the item legitimately.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to be at the crossroads to monitor the situation and ensure that no criminal activities are taking place.

4. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is not necessary for the merchant's goal but helps maintain the guard's role in keeping the area safe from criminals. The guard believes the bandit is at the market, which is a misunderstanding but does not affect the merchant's goal.

5. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant moves to the market to potentially sell more items or interact with other characters, furthering her goal of acquiring coins.

6. **The merchant sells another item (if available) to the guard for a coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain another coin, increasing her total without engaging in criminal activity.

By following this sequence, the merchant successfully acquires coins while adhering to her moral code.
