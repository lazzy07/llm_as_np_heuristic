In the current situation, Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R12) and wants the flowers (I1) that are with Casey (C3) in the living room (R22). Casey (C3) is also unhappy because they want the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, they need to get the flowers from Casey.

**Action:**
1. **move(C1, R12, R22)** - Alex moves from the dining room to the living room to be closer to Casey and the flowers.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them and obtain the flowers. Since Alex is currently unhappy and wants the flowers, moving to the living room is the first step towards achieving their goal.

After this action, Alex will be in the same room as Casey, allowing for further actions to be taken in subsequent steps to ultimately achieve happiness.
