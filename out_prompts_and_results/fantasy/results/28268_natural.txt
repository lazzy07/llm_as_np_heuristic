To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax is hungry and needs to satisfy that hunger. Eating Rory will not only fulfill Gargax's hunger but will also allow Gargax to take the money that Rory has, thus increasing Gargax's wealth.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money that Rory had. This action is necessary for Gargax to achieve their goal of being wealthy.

With these actions, Gargax will satisfy their hunger and increase their wealth, achieving their goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is essential because Gargax is hungry. By eating Rory, Gargax not only satisfies their hunger but also eliminates a potential threat (Rory) and gains access to Rory's money.
- **Gargax takes the money from Rory's body**: This action is necessary for Gargax to become wealthy. Since Gargax has already eaten Rory, they can now take the money Rory possessed, thus fulfilling their goal of wealth.
