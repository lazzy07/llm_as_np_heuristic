To achieve his goal, Bubba takes the following action:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot Bambi, killing her. This action satisfies his hunger, as he can now eat the deer.

This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to eat, and since he is hungry, killing Bambi provides him with food. The story is short and direct, focusing solely on Bubba's immediate needs.
