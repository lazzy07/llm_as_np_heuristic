To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary to allow Zoe to be present on the surface where the Lizard is located, facilitating their interaction and the potential for friendship.

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, which is essential for them to interact and potentially become friends.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is crucial as it establishes a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with both characters' goals of making friends.

4. **The volcano erupts**: This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where the volcano erupts, leading to a character's demise.

5. **The Lizard dies due to the eruption**: Since the Lizard is on the surface when the volcano erupts, it results in the Lizard's death, fulfilling the condition of a character dying.

The sequence of actions ensures that both characters achieve their goal of making friends, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano and the death of the Lizard.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)",
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcome of the story.
