To achieve the goal of having the US Army possess the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring the Nazis are dead, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army travels to Tanis to confront the Nazis and retrieve the Ark. This is necessary because the Ark is currently in Tanis, and the US Army needs to be there to take control of the situation.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, Tanis)**: The US Army takes the Ark from Indiana Jones. This action is necessary because the US Army wants to possess the Ark, and Indiana Jones is currently holding it.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, Tanis)**: The US Army opens the Ark. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, since the goal is to ensure the Nazis are dead, this action will also eliminate the threat posed by the Nazis, who are already dead from their previous encounter with the Ark.

4. **travel(USArmy, Tanis, USA)**: The US Army travels back to the USA with the Ark. This action is necessary to complete the journey and ensure the Ark is now in the possession of the US Army.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The US Army travels to Tanis to confront the Nazis and retrieve the Ark.
- The US Army takes the Ark from Indiana Jones, fulfilling their goal of possession.
- The US Army opens the Ark, which is dangerous, resulting in the death of the personnel but also ensuring the Nazis are dead.
- The US Army travels back to the USA with the Ark, completing the story with the Ark in their possession.
