To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the story will focus on building a positive relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.**  
   - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous. By moving to the spaceship, she can think of a way to approach the Lizard without the immediate threat of the volcano.

2. **Zoe teleports back from the spaceship to the surface.**  
   - Zoe returns to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary to initiate contact and build a relationship.

3. **Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located.**  
   - This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, showing her intention to communicate and make peace.

4. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.**  
   - This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends. By making peace, they can establish a positive relationship.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to a safe area on the surface.**  
   - This action ensures both characters are safe and can continue to build their friendship away from the danger of the volcano.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
