The bandit, having just looted the medicine from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the situation. With the guard present and armed, the bandit knows that attacking the guard would be risky. Instead, the bandit chooses to walk back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the medicine and any coins she has.

**Action: The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**

This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to secure the medicine and any coins she has in a safe location, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
