2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is important for Casey to be in a position to share their happiness with others.

4. **give(C3, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to themselves. This action is a bit unconventional but serves to signify that Casey has successfully obtained the item they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
