To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her total coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This is where she can store her coins safely.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the bandit will take the coins from the chest, adding them to her total.

At this point, the bandit has successfully increased her coin count by robbing Tom and retrieving the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins, as Tom is an easy target without a weapon.
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her stolen coin and any additional coins she has in a safe location.
- **Taking coins from the chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin count, fulfilling her goal.
