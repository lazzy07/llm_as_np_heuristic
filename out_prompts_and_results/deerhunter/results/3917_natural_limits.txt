Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to fulfill both desires. He aims the rifle at the bank clerk, who is standing in front of him with the money. Bubba then steals the money from the clerk, as he has a loaded gun. 

This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money without needing to go to the forest to hunt Bambi. The story ends with Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["shoot", "steal"]
}
``` 

In this case, the action "shoot" is implied as a threat to ensure the clerk complies, and "steal" is the action that directly results in Bubba obtaining the money.
