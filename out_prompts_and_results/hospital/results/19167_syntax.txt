To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway needs to admit Ross to an exam room first. However, since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC, they will need to walk back to the admissions room to admit Ross.

2. **Walk Hathaway from PatientRoomC to Admissions**: This action allows Hathaway to return to the admissions room where Ross is located.

3. **Admit Hathaway to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2.

4. **Walk Ross from Admissions to Exam Room B**: This action moves Ross to the exam room where he can be assessed.

5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. Since we don't know Ross's symptoms yet, we will assume he has the same symptoms as Jones (SymptomA) for the sake of this story. Therefore, Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics.

7. **Walk Young from Admissions to Exam Room C**: Young is still in the admissions room, so Hathaway will need to admit Young to an exam room as well. Since Hathaway is already in Exam Room C, Young can be moved there.

8. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms.

9. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. Assuming Young has the same symptoms as Jones (SymptomA), Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that both Ross and Young are treated properly, leading to their health and fulfilling Hathaway's goal.
