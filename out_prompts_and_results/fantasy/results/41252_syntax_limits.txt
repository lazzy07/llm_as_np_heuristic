To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where Talia is currently located. This action is necessary because Rory needs to be with Talia to propose marriage to her, which is essential for his happiness.

2. **propose(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory proposes to Talia in the cave. This action is crucial as it allows Rory to express his desire to marry Talia, which is a step towards achieving his happiness.

3. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action is necessary for both characters to become happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory and Talia get married in the cave. This final action solidifies their relationship and ensures that Rory is happy.

5. **take(Rory, Treasure, Gargax, Cave)**: After the marriage, Rory can take the treasure from Gargax, who is present in the cave. This action allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling his goal of wealth.

6. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory can choose to become hungry, but since he has just married Talia and taken the treasure, he is not in immediate need of food.

The sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goals of happiness and wealth while also considering his hunger.
