To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 2, they can assess Ross, who is in Admissions. This will help Hathaway determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room C. This will allow Hathaway to treat Ross based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in Admissions. This will help Hathaway determine Jones's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This will allow Hathaway to treat Jones based on the symptoms identified.

5. **Treat Young**: Since Young is already in Exam Room A and has been assessed with SymptomB, Hathaway can treat Young with the appropriate treatment for SymptomB (which is assumed to be Flaze).

6. **Treat Ross**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room C, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified during the assessment.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, after admitting Jones to Exam Room B, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified during the assessment.
