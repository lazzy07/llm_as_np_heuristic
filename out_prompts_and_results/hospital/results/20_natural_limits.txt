**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B with Jones, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room A to assess his condition. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 1. After admitting Ross, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the lack of clear symptoms. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, but fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis and remains alive. 

Next, Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is still waiting. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C and assesses him. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment, and Young becomes healthy.

Finally, with both Jones and Young alive and healthy, Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
