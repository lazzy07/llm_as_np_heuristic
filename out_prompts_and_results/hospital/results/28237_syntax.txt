To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC with Jones, the first action is to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze; if they have a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat Ross, who is currently in Admissions. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated.

4. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Once Hathaway reaches Admissions, they will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Ross.

5. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and treat Young, who is currently in Admissions. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are treated.

7. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Once Hathaway reaches Admissions, they will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify the correct treatment for Young.

8. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
