Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. Since both Jones and Ross are in the admissions room, Hathaway admits them to the available exam room B. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure both patients are treated.

Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room B. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Ross dies.

Afterward, Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to exam room A. Young is still in admissions, and Hathaway assesses him. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment, and Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
