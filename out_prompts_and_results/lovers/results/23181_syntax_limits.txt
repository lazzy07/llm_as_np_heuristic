In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is chocolates), and Casey wants item I2 (which is jewelry). Since Blake is aware that Alex wants I3 and that Casey has put down I3 in the living room, Blake can take action to help Alex achieve happiness.

**Story Completion:**

1. **pick_up(Blake, I3, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I3) that Casey has put down in the living room (R21). This action is necessary because it allows Blake to fulfill Alex's desire for chocolates, which is essential for Alex's happiness.

2. **give(Blake, I3, Alex, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex. This action directly helps Alex achieve happiness, as it provides Alex with the item they want.

After these actions, both Blake and Alex are happy because Blake has successfully given Alex the item they wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is to pick up the chocolates from the living room, which is necessary for Blake to have the item to give to Alex.
- The second action is to give the chocolates to Alex, which directly fulfills Alex's desire and makes both characters happy.
