To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to achieve his goal of being healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross, who is currently waiting there. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to, but it is not directly related to Jones's goal.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross also receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway will treat Ross based on the symptoms identified. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is also healthy, which contributes to the overall goal of the hospital.

6. **Walk to PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will walk to PatientRoomA to assess Young, who is currently there. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to.

7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment.

8. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is also healthy.

By following these steps, Jones will be treated correctly and achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
