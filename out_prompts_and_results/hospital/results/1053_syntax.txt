To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room, to determine their symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat them with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis).

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on their assessment.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on their assessment.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Young**: This action is crucial to identify Young's condition and determine the correct treatment.
- **Assess Jones**: Similarly, assessing Jones is necessary to understand their symptoms and provide the right treatment.
- **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is still in the admissions room, assessing them is essential to ensure they receive the correct treatment as well.
- **Treat Young**: This action is taken after assessing Young to ensure they receive the correct treatment based on their symptoms.
- **Treat Jones**: Following the assessment, treating Jones ensures they are also on the path to recovery.
- **Treat Ross**: Finally, treating Ross ensures that all patients are accounted for and treated appropriately.
