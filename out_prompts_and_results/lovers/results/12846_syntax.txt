To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake (C2) moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) where Alex (C1) and Casey (C3) are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with both Alex and Casey.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) they have to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) to check on the situation. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows Alex to be aware of the outcome.

At this point, Casey has received the jewelry they wanted, making them happy. The other characters can still interact, but the primary goal of Casey's happiness has been achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey to give them the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I3, C3, R12)**: This is the crucial action that directly leads to Casey's happiness by providing them with the item they desire.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: While this action does not affect Casey's happiness, it allows Alex to remain engaged in the story and aware of the situation.
