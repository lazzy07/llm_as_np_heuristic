In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring that all patients are healthy. The goal is to treat both Ross and Young effectively, as they are currently in exam rooms and need to be assessed and treated for their symptoms.

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they are still able to accurately assess Young without making a mistake. This action is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for ensuring Young's health.

After treating Young, Hathaway can then proceed to assess and treat Ross in a similar manner, but since the goal is to keep the story short, we will focus on Young's treatment.

### Explanation of Actions:
