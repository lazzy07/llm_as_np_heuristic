To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also there. Bubba is hungry and has a desire for money, while the clerk has money but is not hungry. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, having a loaded rifle, can steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is included to move Bubba away from the bank after the theft, ensuring he is not caught.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is already dead from the previous action, Bubba can eat Bambi. This action is included to satisfy Bubba's hunger.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money he desires without resorting to violence against the clerk, which would be unnecessary since he can simply take the money.
- **go**: This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.
- **eat**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, ensuring he is not left hungry after the theft.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money from the clerk, and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
