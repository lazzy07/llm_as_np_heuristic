In this story, the Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit has already attacked the Merchant, who is now dead, and the Bandit can loot the Merchant's corpse for the medicine and any coins the Merchant might have had.

The Bandit takes the following action:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the Merchant had. This action helps the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more valuable items.

After this action, the Bandit has successfully looted the Merchant and can now carry the medicine, which is a valuable item, and potentially any coins the Merchant had, thus achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Looting the Merchant**: This is the only necessary action for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying valuable items. Since the Merchant is dead, the Bandit can take whatever the Merchant had, which may include coins.
