**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is in the hospital admissions room with three patients: Jones, Young, and Ross. Since Jones is already assigned to exam room A, Hathaway decides to assess Jones first to determine his symptoms.

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to find out what symptoms he is showing. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

After assessing Jones, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it will make Jones healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

Next, Hathaway turns to Young, who is also in exam room A.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young also receives the correct treatment.

Upon assessment, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. This action ensures that Young becomes healthy as well.

Now, Hathaway has treated both Jones and Young successfully. The only patient left is Ross, who is still in the admissions room.

5. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Ross to exam room B. Although this does not immediately treat Ross, it is necessary for him to be assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated in the future.

At this point, Hathaway has successfully treated two patients, and with Ross admitted, he is on the path to ensuring all patients are healthy.

- **Treating Jones and Young**: These actions directly contribute to Hathaway's goal of making the patients healthy.
