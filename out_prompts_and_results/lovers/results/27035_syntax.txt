To ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I1) they want with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because Alex needs to obtain the jewelry to be happy.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is necessary to ensure that Alex has the item they want.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which means Alex is happy. 

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry they want with Casey for the flowers. This is necessary for Alex to get the jewelry.
2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex after the trade. This ensures Alex has the item they want.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry.
