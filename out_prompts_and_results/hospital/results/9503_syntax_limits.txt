1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake in diagnosis. However, assessing Jones is necessary to determine their symptoms. 

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze (due to the workload), they will treat him with antibiotics. This is a risk, but it is necessary to attempt to treat Jones.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms. This is crucial to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment.
