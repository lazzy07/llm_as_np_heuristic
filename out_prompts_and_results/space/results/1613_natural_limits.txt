Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, having just made peace with each other. They both recognize the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface and decide to work together to ensure their safety. Zoe suggests that they should explore the cave further to find a safe place away from the volcano's threat. The Lizard agrees, and they both walk deeper into the cave, away from the surface.

As they explore, they discover a hidden chamber filled with glowing crystals. The Lizard explains that these crystals have healing properties and can help them stay healthy. They both feel a sense of camaraderie as they share this moment, solidifying their friendship.
