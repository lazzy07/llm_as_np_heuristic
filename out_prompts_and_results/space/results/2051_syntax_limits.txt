In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe and the Lizard have already established a friendly relationship, but they need to ensure their safety and make a plan to deal with the eruption.

To complete the story, Zoe will teleport from the spaceship to the surface, where the volcano is erupting. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the surface to help the Lizard and ensure their safety. The eruption will create a sense of urgency, leading to a critical moment where they must work together.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to assist the Lizard and confront the danger of the eruption.

After this action, the volcano erupts, and since Zoe is on the surface, she is caught in the eruption and dies. However, before the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard had already made peace, establishing a friendship. This fulfills the requirement of the story ending with a character dying and two characters making friends.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: This action is crucial as it brings Zoe to the surface where the danger is present. It also sets the stage for the eruption to occur, leading to Zoe's demise while still maintaining the friendship established earlier.
