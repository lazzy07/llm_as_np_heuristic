To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard will attempt to make peace with Zoe. Since they are both on the surface and not currently fighting, this action can help establish a friendly relationship between them. This is crucial for the Lizard to achieve its goal of making friends.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk back to the cave. This action is necessary to ensure the Lizard is in a safer location away from the erupting volcano, which is a dangerous situation on the surface.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard into the cave. This action is important as it allows Zoe to also be in a safer location and continue to build a friendship with the Lizard.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will erupt after both characters have moved to the cave. This action is included to show the danger that was present on the surface, reinforcing the need for both characters to have moved to safety.
