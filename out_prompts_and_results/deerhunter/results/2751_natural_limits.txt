Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has a loaded rifle, he aims at Bambi. He shoots Bambi, killing her.

However, since Bambi does not have any money, he realizes he must return to the bank to get the money he desires.
