To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to find Bambi, who is a potential target for his greed.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the Forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money, and killing Bambi will allow him to eat and satisfy his hunger, which is also a part of his goal.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger and fulfill his immediate need for food.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money again, as he is still greedy and wants to accumulate wealth.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will then return to the Bank. This action is necessary for him to be in a location where he can interact with the Clerk and potentially acquire more money.

6. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will steal from the Clerk, using the rifle to intimidate him. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

By following these actions, Bubba will satisfy his hunger and greed, ultimately achieving his goal of getting money.
