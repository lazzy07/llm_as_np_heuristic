Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, and they are not fighting. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also allowing for the possibility of friendship, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of their goals. By making peace, they can communicate and understand each other's intentions better.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs as a natural consequence of the story's setting. The eruption will lead to a character dying, fulfilling part of the goal.

3. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety from the eruption. Since the Lizard is still on the surface when the volcano erupts, it will lead to the Lizard's demise.

4. **The Lizard dies due to the eruption.** This is the final outcome of the story, where the Lizard, despite having made peace with Zoe, is unable to escape the eruption.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of a character dying (the Lizard) while also allowing for the possibility of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard before the tragic event.
