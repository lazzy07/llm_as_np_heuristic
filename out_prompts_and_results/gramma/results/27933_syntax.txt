To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit starts at the Cottage and walks to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is at the Crossroads.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom, taking the coin that Tom is carrying. This action is possible because Tom is not armed, and the Bandit is armed with a sword. This allows the Bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Cottage and needs to move to the Crossroads to interact with Tom.
- Robbing Tom is a strategic move to gain coins without risking confrontation with the Guard or Merchant, as Tom is unarmed.
- Finally, moving to the Bandit Camp allows the Bandit to store the coins safely, fulfilling her objective.
