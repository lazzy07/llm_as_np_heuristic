To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Since Young is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will first admit Young to an exam room (C) and then assess them to determine their symptoms.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat them.

3. **Assess Young**: After admitting Young to Exam Room C, Hathaway will assess Young to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure they become healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: After treating Young, Hathaway will return to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting there.

6. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat them.

7. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis.

8. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment to ensure they become healthy.

9. **Treat Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Ross in Exam Room A with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment already done.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
