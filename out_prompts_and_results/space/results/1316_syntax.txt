1. **Zoe teleports to the cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, which is essential for communication and establishing a friendship. 
   - Action: `teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Cave)`

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: By initiating a peace-making action, Zoe can improve their relationship and ensure that both characters feel safe and healthy. This action is crucial for achieving the goal of friendship.
   - Action: `make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)`

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together on the surface**: This action symbolizes their newfound friendship and allows them to explore the planet together, ensuring both characters feel safe and healthy in each other's company.
   - Action: `walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)`
