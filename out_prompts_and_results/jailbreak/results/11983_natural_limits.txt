**Story Completion:**

As Ernest stands in the gym, clutching the pack of cigarettes, he feels the weight of the bully's threats looming over him. He knows he needs to act quickly to protect himself and Roy. The bully, noticing the cigarettes, approaches Ernest with a menacing glare, ready to enforce his threats.

In a moment of desperation, Ernest decides to take a risk. He quickly moves towards the gym door and locks it, trapping the bully inside with him. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from escaping and allows Ernest to confront him without the immediate threat of outside interference.

With the bully now locked in, Ernest reaches for the knife that he knows is in the kitchen. He remembers that Roy is still in the cells and is also threatened by the bully. Ernest's plan is to get revenge on the bully for the threats against both of them. He knows that if he can eliminate the bully, he can protect both himself and Roy.

Ernest manages to sneak out of the gym through the vents, heading towards the kitchen. He retrieves the knife and returns to the gym, where the bully is still trapped. In a final confrontation, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, overcoming the threat that has loomed over both him and Roy.

With the bully dead, Ernest feels a sense of relief. However, he knows that he must escape the prison to ensure his safety. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, which he had hidden in the laundry room before they were confiscated. Now disguised, he makes his way to the hallway and crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison, successfully escaping.
