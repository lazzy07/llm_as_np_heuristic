To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a loaded rifle, and he has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can get from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings Bubba closer to his goal of obtaining money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba can steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of getting money.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba confirms his greed and desire for money. This action solidifies his goal and ensures he is aware of his success.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can obtain money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Confirms Bubba's greed and satisfaction with his acquisition of money.
