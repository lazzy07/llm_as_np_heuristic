Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and their friendship is a crucial step toward ensuring their safety. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting volcano. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends now, and the urgency of the situation makes it acceptable.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard needs to find shelter from the eruption. The cave is a safer location compared to the surface, where the volcano is erupting.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is included to illustrate the danger of the surface and the necessity of the previous actions. 

4. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures they can support each other in a safe environment.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - This action solidifies their friendship and mutual understanding, ensuring that they can work together to stay safe and healthy.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
