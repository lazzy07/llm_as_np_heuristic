To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is necessary because the merchant wants to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit, who is a criminal. By reporting the bandit, the merchant can help the guard take action against the bandit, which will ultimately protect her interests and allow her to operate freely in the market.

2. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to respond to the merchant's report and confront the bandit. This action is essential for the guard to fulfill his duty of eliminating criminals.

3. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action is crucial as it removes the bandit from the story, ensuring that the merchant can continue her business without the threat of robbery or violence. The bandit is not armed, making her vulnerable to the guard's attack.

4. **The merchant loots an item from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - After the bandit is dead, the merchant can take advantage of the situation by looting the bandit’s coin, which helps her achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions leads to the merchant successfully acquiring coins while ensuring she does not engage in any criminal activity herself.
