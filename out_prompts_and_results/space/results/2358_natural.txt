Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to his guardianship of the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, teleports to the surface to confront Zoe. 

Once on the surface, the Lizard and Zoe find themselves in a tense standoff. However, as the ground shakes and the volcano begins to erupt, they both realize that they need to work together to survive. Zoe suggests they make peace and collaborate to find a safe place. The Lizard, understanding the urgency of the situation, agrees.
