Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, who is a criminal and poses a threat to him. To ensure his safety and achieve his goal of getting to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to attack the bandit.

Tom attacks the bandit with the sword, successfully killing her. After the bandit falls, Tom loots her body and finds her coins. With the bandit defeated and the coins in his possession, Tom can now safely walk to the cottage carrying the medicine.

This action sequence is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine, as it eliminates the threat posed by the bandit and allows him to gather resources for his journey.
