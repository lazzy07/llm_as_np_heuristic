To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot treat Jones effectively.

5. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is important to ensure that Young is also treated correctly.

6. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will make him healthy.
