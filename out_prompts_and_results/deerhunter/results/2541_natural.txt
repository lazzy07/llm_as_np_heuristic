To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger. It also confirms Bambi's death, which is already established.
   
2. **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.** - Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can take the money that he believes Bambi has, which will fulfill his goal of having money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**: This satisfies Bubba's hunger and confirms Bambi's death.
- **Bubba picks up the money from Bambi.**: This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will be confirmed dead.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat Bambi.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from Bambi."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money while also confirming Bambi's death, which is consistent with the story's requirements.
