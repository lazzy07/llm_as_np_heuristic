In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the flowers (I1). Currently, Alex is in the living room (R22) with Blake (C2) and Casey (C3). The flowers are with Casey (C3) in the same room. 

To achieve their goal, Alex can simply ask Casey to give them the flowers. 

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.

This action is necessary because it directly allows Alex to obtain the item they want (the flowers), thus making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake and Casey will still be unhappy because they do not have the items they want, but the story focuses on Alex achieving their goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

{
  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"]
}
