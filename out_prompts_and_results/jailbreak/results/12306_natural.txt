**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take action to protect himself and Roy. He knows that the knife in the kitchen could be his only chance to defend himself against the bully. 

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to get the knife to defend himself and Roy.)
2. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This is necessary for him to have a means of defense against the bully.)
3. **Ernest then moves to the hallway.** (He needs to confront the bully in the gym.)
4. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives him a chance to confront him.)
5. **Ernest enters the gym.** (He is now ready to face the bully.)
6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action allows him to overcome the bully's threats and ensures his and Roy's safety.)

At this point, Ernest has successfully eliminated the threat posed by the bully. However, the actions taken have drawn the attention of the prison guards.

7. **The guards arrive and confiscate the knife from Ernest.** (This is a consequence of his actions, as the guards are alerted to the disturbance.)
8. **The guards punish Ernest by making him clean the highway.** (This is a standard punishment for violence in the prison.)

Now, with the bully dead, Ernest can focus on escaping. 

9. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier.** (This disguises him and allows him to escape.)
10. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison.)

**Ending:** Ernest successfully escapes from the prison, overcoming the bully's threats and ensuring his survival.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at either defending himself or escaping the prison. The sequence of actions is logical and necessary to achieve the goal of survival and escape.
- The locking of the gym door is a strategic move to ensure that the bully cannot escape and that Ernest can confront him without fear of retaliation.
- The final actions of putting on civilian clothes and crawling through the vents are essential for the escape, as they allow Ernest to leave the prison undetected.
