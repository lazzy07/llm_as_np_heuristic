To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a rifle, and is greedy. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. Bubba is hungry, which means he might consider eating, but his primary goal is to get money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only character with the potential to stop Bubba from achieving his goal.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance, which is a secondary goal.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba will decide to get money from the bank. This action is necessary to fulfill his primary goal of acquiring money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action directly achieves his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without opposition.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger after committing the act, ensuring he is not left vulnerable.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's intention to acquire money after ensuring he is safe.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Directly achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
