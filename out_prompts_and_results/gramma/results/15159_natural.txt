To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to confront the bandit and retrieve his coin, which is essential for his next steps.

2. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, Tom can ensure that the guard will take action against the bandit, which will help Tom reclaim his coin and secure the medicine.

3. **The guard attacks the bandit.**  
   - The guard, being armed and at the market, will attack the bandit, who is also at the market. This action is crucial as it removes the bandit from the equation, allowing Tom to safely retrieve his coin.

4. **Tom loots the bandit’s coin from the corpse of the bandit.**  
   - After the bandit is defeated, Tom can loot the coin from the bandit’s body. This is necessary for Tom to have the coin to buy a sword or to ensure he has some form of currency.

5. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - With the coin in hand, Tom can now return to the crossroads, where he can plan his next move.

6. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:

By reporting the bandit, Tom ensures that he has the guard's assistance, which is critical for overcoming the threat posed by the bandit. Looting the bandit’s coin allows Tom to have some currency, which is a strategic move for future interactions, even though he does not need to buy anything further to achieve his goal.
