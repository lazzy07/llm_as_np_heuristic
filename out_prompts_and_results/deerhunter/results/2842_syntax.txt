To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk, as the clerk is the only one with money in this scenario.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money that the clerk had. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, enters the bank with a loaded rifle. He sees the bank clerk and, in a moment of desperation, he shoots the clerk to take the money. 
- After ensuring the clerk is incapacitated, Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk's possession, fulfilling his goal of acquiring money.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **shoot**: This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle (the clerk) standing between him and the money.
- **pickup**: This action allows Bubba to physically take the money after the clerk has been incapacitated.
