To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and ensure that the correct treatment is administered.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, which we will assume corresponds to Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and ensure that the correct treatment is administered.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. Since Young has SymptomB, which we will assume corresponds to Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is crucial to identify the correct disease and ensure the right treatment is given.
- **Treat Ross**: Administering the correct treatment (antibiotics for Flaze) will make Ross healthy.
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment.
- **Treat Young**: Administering the correct treatment (steroids for Jarkis) will make Young healthy.
