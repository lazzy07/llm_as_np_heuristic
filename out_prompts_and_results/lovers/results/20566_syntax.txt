To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey wants to be happy and needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items.

2. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This is important because Blake wants to help Alex and may need to interact with Casey regarding the chocolates.

3. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Blake to have an item to trade or give to Alex.

4. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake returns to the living room with the chocolates. This is important to facilitate the next action where Blake can interact with Alex.

5. **give(C3, I2, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex. This is crucial because it allows Alex to receive an item, which may help in achieving happiness.

6. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey returns to the living room. This is necessary for Casey to be present for the next action.

7. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) with Alex for the chocolates (I2). This is the final action that allows Alex to get the flowers they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, and the story concludes successfully.
