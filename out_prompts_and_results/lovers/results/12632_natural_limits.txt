In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. The flowers are currently in the living room, the chocolates are in the dining room, and the jewelry is also in the living room.

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, the following action takes place:

1. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.** This action is necessary because Blake wants the jewelry, and by picking it up, Blake can achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still in the living room and is unhappy because they do not have the flowers.
- Blake is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
- Casey is still in the living room and is unhappy because they do not have the jewelry.

This single action allows Blake to achieve their goal of happiness.
