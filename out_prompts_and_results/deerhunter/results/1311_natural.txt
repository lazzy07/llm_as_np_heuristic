To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will take place:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba is at the bank with the rifle loaded, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary because Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has 1 money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money.

- Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, goes to the bank with a loaded rifle.
- Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk, who is unaware of the threat.
- Bubba successfully steals the 1 money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
