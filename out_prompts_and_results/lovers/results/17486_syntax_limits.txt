In this story, Alex wants to be happy by having the item they desire, which is the jewelry (I1). Currently, Alex is happy because they already have the jewelry. However, Casey is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), and Blake is also unhappy because they want the flowers (I3). 

To ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness, the following action is taken:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R21)**: Alex (C1) trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Casey (C2) for the chocolates (I2) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to become happy by receiving the item they desire, while Alex also achieves their goal of happiness by giving away the jewelry, which they already possess.

After this action, the happiness status is as follows:
- Alex (C1) is happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey (C2) is happy because they now have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake (C3) remains unhappy because they still want the flowers (I3).
