The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero and the guard at the market. Knowing that the merchant is dead and the medicine is now unguarded, she decides to take action. The bandit approaches the hero, who is unarmed and unsuspecting. 

The bandit attacks the hero, killing him. She then loots the hero's coin, adding it to her own collection. With the hero dead, the bandit now has the opportunity to return to the bandit camp with both her coins and the medicine that was previously with the merchant.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the hero**: The bandit attacks the hero because he is unarmed and poses no threat. This action allows her to eliminate a potential witness and gain an additional coin.
2. **Loot the hero's coin**: After killing the hero, the bandit loots his coin, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

With these actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying more coins.
