To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary to bring Zoe back to the dangerous surface where the volcano can erupt.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.**  
   - This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This action results in Zoe's death, which is a direct consequence of the volcano erupting.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.**  
   - The Lizard moves to the surface to check on Zoe, demonstrating concern and reinforcing their friendship.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe (in spirit).**  
   - Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard can still express a sense of friendship and peace, acknowledging their bond even after Zoe's demise.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, a character dying (Zoe), and the Lizard maintaining a sense of friendship with Zoe, even in her absence.
