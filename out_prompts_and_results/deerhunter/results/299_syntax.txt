To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is crucial as it prepares him to threaten the bank clerk, which is necessary for him to steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba then uses the loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action directly fulfills the goal of Bubba obtaining the money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but provides a logical conclusion to his actions.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba shoots Bambi in the forest. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Equips Bubba with a loaded weapon, enabling him to threaten the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Returns Bubba to the forest, providing closure to his actions.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Ensures Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
