To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the necessary actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is essential for diagnosing Ross correctly.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. This is the final step to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- The first action is to assess Ross, which is necessary to identify his condition.
- The second action is to treat Ross based on the assessment, which is essential for his recovery.

Since the goal is to ensure Ross is alive and healthy, these actions directly contribute to that outcome.
