To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. Since Young is already in PatientRoomA, this action is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Walk Jones to PatientRoomA**: Finally, Hathaway will walk Jones from the admissions room to PatientRoomA to assess his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated and becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. This is the final step to ensure that all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
