To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **Casey (C3) gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R21)**. This action is necessary because Blake currently has the chocolates, and by giving them to Blake, Casey can then receive the jewelry in a later step.

2. **Blake (C2) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R21)**. This action allows Casey to finally obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake. This is necessary for Casey to facilitate the next action where they can receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey. This is the final step that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

Now, Casey has the jewelry, which makes them happy.
