Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows he needs to escape the prison to ensure his safety and to get a pack of cigarettes. Since he is currently in the hallway, he takes the opportunity to disguise himself with the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will help him avoid detection by the guards when he makes his escape.

Next, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he is on the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise. With the disguise on, he successfully escapes from the prison, ensuring his safety and freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: Ernest disguises himself to avoid being recognized by the guards, which is crucial for his escape.
2. **vent(Ernest, Highway)**: Crawling through the vents allows Ernest to bypass the prison's security and reach the highway.
3. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Finally, escaping from the highway ensures that Ernest is no longer in danger from the bully or the prison guards.

This sequence of actions allows Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free, while also avoiding any threats.
