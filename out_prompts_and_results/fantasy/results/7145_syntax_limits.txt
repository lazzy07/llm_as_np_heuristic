In the current situation, Talia is in the Village with Rory and Gargax, while Vince is dead. Talia wants to be happy and wealthy, and she currently has no money or treasure. Rory, who is also in the Village, wants to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Gargax is hungry and wants to be wealthy but does not care about happiness. 

To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money that Vince had, which is now on his dead body. This action is necessary for Talia to gain wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **propose(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory proposes marriage to Talia. This action is important because it can lead to Talia's happiness if she accepts the proposal.

3. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of becoming happy.

By taking these actions, Talia will achieve her goal of happiness through marriage and will also gain wealth by picking up the money.
