To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, we need to ensure that Casey is also happy, as Alex wants Casey to be happy. Currently, Casey is unhappy because they want the item I2 (chocolates), which is in the dining room (R21). 

Since Alex is already happy with the jewelry (I1) they received from Casey, the next step is for Casey to get the chocolates. The simplest way to achieve this is for Blake to give Casey the chocolates, as Blake is in the same room as Casey and can easily access the item.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(Blake, I2, Casey, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey in the dining room (R21). This action makes Casey happy because they now have the item they want.

After this action, both Alex and Casey will be happy, fulfilling Alex's goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(Blake, I2, Casey, R21)**: This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the chocolates. By giving the item to Casey, Blake helps both Casey and Alex achieve their happiness.
