Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides to take action to satisfy both his hunger and his desire for money. He notices Bambi, the deer, nearby in the forest. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi to eat her and also fulfill his hunger.

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi, which allows him to kill the deer. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats her. This action fulfills his hunger.

By taking these actions, Bubba achieves his goal of satisfying his hunger while also being in a position to potentially gain more money in the future, as he can now use the deer for food instead of spending money on it.
