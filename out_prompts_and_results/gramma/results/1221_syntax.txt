To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves from the Bandit Camp to the Crossroads to be in a more central location where she can interact with Tom and the Guard.

2. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant then walks to the Market, where she can potentially sell items or interact with Tom and the Guard.

3. **buy(Merchant, MerchantSword, MerchantCoin, Market)**: The Merchant buys a sword using one of her coins. This action is crucial as it allows her to defend herself and maintain her status as a non-criminal while still being able to interact with Tom.

4. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks back to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom again.

5. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant returns to the Bandit Camp to deposit her coins safely in the chest, ensuring she does not lose them to any potential threats.

6. **take(Merchant, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp, increasing her total coin count without committing any crimes.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to maximize her coins while avoiding criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.
