Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money. He looks at the bank clerk, who has the money he desires. With the rifle loaded, Bubba points it at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, realizing the danger, hands over the money to Bubba. 

Now, Bubba has the money he wanted, and the story ends with him achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not included because it is unnecessary for achieving the goal of Bubba having the money. Instead, the clerk willingly gives the money to avoid violence.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is implied when the clerk hands over the money, fulfilling Bubba's goal of obtaining it without further conflict.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk", "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money while keeping the story concise and within the specified actions.
