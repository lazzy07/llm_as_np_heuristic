To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items later.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room. This is important as it allows Blake to interact with Casey and potentially facilitate a trade or give.

3. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to ensure Blake knows what Casey desires, which may influence future actions.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to join Casey and Blake. This is essential for Alex to be in the same room as the other characters to negotiate or trade.

5. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake for the jewelry (I1). This is the key action that allows Alex to eventually get the jewelry they want.

6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex receives the item they desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have obtained the jewelry (I1).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Movement**: The characters need to be in the same room to interact, trade, or give items. Moving to the dining room allows for all characters to be together.
- **Tell**: Communicating desires helps characters understand what others want, which can lead to successful trades or gifts.
- **Trade**: This action is crucial for transferring items between characters, allowing them to fulfill their wants.
- **Give**: This final action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
