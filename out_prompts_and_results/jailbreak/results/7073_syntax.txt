**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, Roy is in the hallway and has just finished his chores. He knows that Ernest is in the cell block and is threatened by the bully. To help both himself and Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Lock the Gym**: Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from coming out and threatening them further. This action is crucial because it secures a safe space for both him and Ernest, allowing them to plan their next move without the immediate threat of the bully.

2. **Go to the Cells**: After locking the gym, Roy moves to the cell block to meet up with Ernest. This is important because they need to work together to ensure their safety and plan their escape.

3. **Steal the Knife**: Once in the cell block, Roy steals the knife from the kitchen. This is a necessary action because the knife will provide them with a means to defend themselves against the bully if he tries to confront them.

4. **Disguise Ernest**: Roy then helps Ernest put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. This is essential for their escape plan, as they need to disguise themselves to avoid being recognized by the guards.

5. **Go to the Hall**: With Ernest now disguised, they both move to the hallway. This is a strategic move to get closer to the exit.

6. **Vent to the Highway**: Roy and Ernest crawl through the vents to reach the highway. This action is critical as it allows them to bypass the guards and reach the outside world.

7. **Escape**: Finally, once they are on the highway, they both put on the civilian clothes and escape from the prison. This is the ultimate goal for both characters, ensuring their survival and freedom.
