To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant, taking the coins that Tom had previously robbed from her. This action is necessary for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to secure her coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Merchant**: The Bandit needs to acquire coins to fulfill her goal. Since Tom has already robbed the Merchant, the Bandit can take advantage of the situation and rob the Merchant herself.
- **Walking to the Camp**: Once the Bandit has the coins, she needs to move to the Bandit Camp to either keep the coins on her or store them in the chest, thus achieving her goal.
