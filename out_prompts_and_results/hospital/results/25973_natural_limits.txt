Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients quickly, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. However, since Ross actually has Flaze, he dies. This action is necessary to reduce her workload and to attempt to help Ross.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to see if she can admit Young, who is still waiting. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are seen and treated.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that Young receives the attention he needs and to reduce her workload further.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has assessed and treated Ross, albeit incorrectly, and has admitted Young, ensuring that she is working towards her goal of having all patients healthy, even if one patient did not survive.
