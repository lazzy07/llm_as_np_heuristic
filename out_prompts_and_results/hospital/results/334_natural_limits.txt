Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B to manage the patient load effectively. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 2, but it allows for better organization of patients.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway, unaware of the actual condition, mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the rash symptom associated with it. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, this treatment is effective, and Ross becomes healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. Ross, now healthy, is relieved and achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
