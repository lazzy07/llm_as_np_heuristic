Zoe, the space explorer, is determined to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. She knows that the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt, and she wants to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. 

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports down to the surface to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to initiate any form of communication or friendship.

2. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **Walk (Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, the Lizard feels safe and decides to walk back to the cave, inviting Zoe to join. This action signifies the beginning of their friendship and ensures that both characters are moving to a safer location away from the erupting volcano.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of their safety.
