To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Talia is currently at the cave with Gargax, who is hungry and wants to eat a human. By eating Talia, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and Talia will no longer be alive, which will allow her to achieve her goal of happiness through the acceptance of her fate.

2. **Rory takes the treasure from Talia's dead body**: After Talia is eaten, Rory can take the treasure from Talia's body. This action is crucial because it allows Rory to gain wealth, which indirectly contributes to Talia's goal of being wealthy, as she is now part of Rory's life.

3. **Rory travels to the village**: Rory will then travel to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary for Rory to share the treasure with Vince, who has the money, thus creating a situation where Talia's goal of wealth is fulfilled through Rory's actions.

4. **Vince and Rory marry**: This action is important because it solidifies the bond between Rory and Vince, allowing them to share their wealth and happiness together. Talia's happiness is indirectly achieved through the happiness of Rory and Vince.

5. **Vince proposes to Rory**: This action is necessary to ensure that the marriage is formalized, which will lead to both characters being happy.

6. **Rory accepts Vince's proposal**: This action is essential for the marriage to take place, ensuring that both characters are happy.

7. **Rory and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies the happiness of both Rory and Vince, which indirectly fulfills Talia's goal of happiness through their union.

In summary, Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy is achieved through the actions of Gargax, Rory, and Vince, even after her demise. The story illustrates how interconnected the characters' goals are and how Talia's happiness can be realized through the actions of others.
