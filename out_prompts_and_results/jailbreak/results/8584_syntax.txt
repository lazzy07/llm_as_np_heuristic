To achieve the goal of either Ernest or Roy overcoming the bully's threats or one of them dying, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**: Roy locks the gym door while the bully is inside. This action prevents the bully from leaving and protects Roy from immediate threats. 

2. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: With the gym locked, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing them to feel safe.

3. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Gym)**: After killing the bully, Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This action prepares him for an escape.

4. **vent(Roy, Gym)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the hallway. This action allows him to bypass the guards and reach the highway.

5. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Finally, Roy escapes from the prison using the civilian disguise. This action ensures his survival and freedom.

This sequence of actions leads to Roy overcoming the bully's threats and escaping the prison, while Ernest remains alive but does not take any actions that lead to his death.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **lock_gym**: This secures Roy from the bully and gives him a chance to act without fear of retaliation.
- **kill**: This is the decisive action that removes the bully as a threat, allowing Roy to feel safe.
- **disguise**: This prepares Roy for a successful escape, ensuring he can blend in and avoid detection.
- **vent**: This allows Roy to navigate through the prison without being seen by guards.
- **escape**: This is the final action that fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.
