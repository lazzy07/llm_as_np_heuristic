**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A for Jarkis using steroids. (This is necessary because Young is showing a rash, which is a symptom of Jarkis. Treating Young correctly will make them healthy.)
2. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions. (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess and admit the next patient.)
3. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C. (This is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
4. Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C. (This allows Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross.)
5. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C and observes Unknown symptoms. (This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Ross.)
6. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C for Flaze using antibiotics. (Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, and Dr. Hathaway has a low workload, this action is taken to ensure Ross is treated for Flaze, which is a possibility given the context.)
7. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions. (This prepares Dr. Hathaway to admit the next patient if needed.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action treats Young correctly, ensuring they become healthy.
- The subsequent actions allow Dr. Hathaway to manage the workload effectively while ensuring all patients are assessed and treated.
- The treatment of Ross is based on the assumption that he may have Flaze, which is a reasonable action given the unknown symptoms and the need to keep all patients healthy.
