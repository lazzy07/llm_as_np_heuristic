**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is waiting there. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway then assesses Young in the admissions room. This is also necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate care.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with steroids if he shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash). This is crucial for Ross's health and aligns with Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young with steroids if he also shows symptoms of Jarkis. This ensures that both patients are treated correctly and remain healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is essential to identify Ross's condition and ensure he receives the correct treatment. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot know how to help him.
  
- **Assess Young**: Similar to Ross, assessing Young is necessary to determine his health status and provide the right treatment. This keeps Hathaway's workload manageable and ensures all patients are evaluated.

- **Treat Ross**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis, treating him with steroids is the correct action to take. This directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy.

- **Treat Young**: Treating Young with steroids, if he has Jarkis, is the final step in ensuring both patients are healthy. This action completes Hathaway's objective.
