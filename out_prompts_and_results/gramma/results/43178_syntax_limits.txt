After the last events, Tom is at the Crossroads with the medicine he looted from the bandit. His goal is to return to the cottage carrying the medicine. Since there are no threats at the Crossroads and he is not a criminal, he can safely walk back to the cottage.

**Action:**
- walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage while carrying the medicine. There are no other characters or threats that would impede his progress, and since he is not armed, he cannot engage in any other actions that would complicate his journey.

**Final Plan:**
