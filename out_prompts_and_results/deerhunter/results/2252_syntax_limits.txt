To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is in the forest with a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because Bambi wants to be alive, but Bubba's greed for money drives him to eliminate a potential threat to his goal. By shooting Bambi, he can ensure that he can take the money from the bank clerk without any interference.

2. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now focus on getting the money from the bank clerk. Since he has already decided to get money, this action is implicit in his motivation and does not need to be explicitly stated again.

This results in Bubba having the opportunity to take the money from the bank clerk after eliminating Bambi.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for achieving the goal. It also allows Bubba to eliminate a potential witness or threat to his plans.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is already part of the story's setup, but it reinforces Bubba's motivation to acquire money, which he can now pursue without the threat of Bambi.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively meets the goal with the minimum number of actions while ensuring the story remains coherent and complete.
