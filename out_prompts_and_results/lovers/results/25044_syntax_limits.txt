In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that Blake has, as it is the item Blake wants. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Blake is located. This action is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I3) they received from Alex for the chocolates (I2) that Blake has. This action allows both characters to achieve their goals: Casey gets the jewelry they want, and Blake gets the chocolates they desire.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake is happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Alex remains unhappy, but their goal of making Casey happy is achieved.

The actions are minimal and directly lead to Casey's happiness while also ensuring Blake is happy, fulfilling both characters' desires.
