Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B with Jones, assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable, so he decides to treat Jones with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to attempt to help Jones, even though it may not be the correct treatment.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. He admits Ross to Patient Room C, where he can be treated. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives attention and care, as he is also a patient who wants to be healthy.
