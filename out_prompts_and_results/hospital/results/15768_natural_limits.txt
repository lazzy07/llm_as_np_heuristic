Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Young healthy. 

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives attention and is not left unattended, as both Jones and Ross are still in Admissions and need to be assigned to an exam room.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can accurately assess their symptoms. If Ross has a rash, they would have Jarkis, and Hathaway can treat them with steroids, ensuring that all patients are healthy.

This sequence of actions ensures that Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
