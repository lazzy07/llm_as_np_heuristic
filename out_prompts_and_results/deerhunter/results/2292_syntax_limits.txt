To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, thus ensuring that Bubba can take the money for himself.

After these two actions, Bubba will have the money from the clerk, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to reach the location where the money is held. Without this action, he cannot confront the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to kill the clerk and take the money, achieving the goal of the story.
