To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to access the chocolates, which are located in the dining room.

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is essential for their happiness.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to return to the living room to be with Alex and Casey after obtaining the chocolates.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action is a strategic move. By giving the chocolates to Casey, Blake can ensure that Casey is happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as they want Alex to be happy too.

5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake in the living room.**  
   - In return for the chocolates, Casey gives Blake the jewelry, which Blake can now hold, ensuring that both characters are satisfied.

At the end of these actions, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry. Alex remains unhappy because they still want the flowers, but the focus is on Blake achieving their goal.
