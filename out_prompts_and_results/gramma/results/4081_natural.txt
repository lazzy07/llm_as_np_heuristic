**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market. (The merchant prefers to be at the market to maximize her coin collection.)
2. The merchant sells the medicine to the guard for the hero's coin. (This action allows the merchant to gain a coin without becoming a criminal, achieving her goal of collecting coins.)
3. The guard walks from the market to the crossroads. (The guard is now aware of the merchant's location and is moving to ensure the area is safe.)
4. The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard. (This action is unnecessary for the merchant's goal but helps the guard fulfill his duty.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The merchant's first action of walking to the market is crucial as it aligns with her goal of collecting coins. 
- Selling the medicine to the guard is the key action that allows the merchant to achieve her goal without resorting to criminal behavior. 
- The guard's movement and reporting actions are not directly related to the merchant's goal but serve to maintain the story's context and character motivations.
