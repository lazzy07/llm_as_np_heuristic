**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is in the admissions room with three patients: Jones, Ross, and Young. Since Ross is already assigned to exam room A, Hathaway decides to assess Ross to determine his symptoms.

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

3. **walk(Ross, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: After being treated, Ross walks back to the admissions room to inform Hathaway of his recovery.

At this point, Ross has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The assessment of Ross is crucial to identify his symptoms accurately. This is necessary for Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.
- The treatment with antibiotics is essential because it directly addresses Ross's condition (Flaze), ensuring his recovery.
- Ross walking back to the admissions room signifies his return to a state of health and allows for the possibility of further interactions or treatments for the other patients.
