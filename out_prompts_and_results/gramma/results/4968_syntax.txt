To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage, which is his desired location. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his goal.

The other characters will not take any actions that interfere with Tom's goal, as they are either not in a position to do so or their goals do not conflict with Tom's immediate objective.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential because it directly moves Tom to his desired location (the cottage) while carrying the medicine he has just purchased. 

No other actions are needed since Tom's goal is straightforward and can be achieved in a single step.
