**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A. Young, who is currently in Patient Room C, is experiencing unknown symptoms. To ensure Young's health, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young's condition.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Young and assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the workload.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Given that Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis. However, since Young is alive and the treatment for Flaze is antibiotics, this action is taken to ensure Young's health.

4. **Young becomes healthy.**  
   - This is the desired outcome of the treatment, fulfilling Young's goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is essential for Dr. Hathaway to physically reach Young, as the doctor cannot assess or treat a patient without being in the same room.
- The second action is crucial for diagnosing Young's condition, which is necessary before any treatment can be administered.
- The third action is a treatment decision based on the assessment. Despite the risk of misdiagnosis due to the workload, it is the only option available to help Young.
- The final outcome of Young becoming healthy is the ultimate goal of the story, ensuring that Young achieves their desire to be alive and healthy.
