**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room A and assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, as Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway determines that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for achieving Hathaway's goal of making Ross healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the Admissions room to assess Young, who is still waiting. This is important to ensure that Young is also treated appropriately and does not remain untreated.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is essential to identify Ross's condition accurately. Since Hathaway's workload is at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if he were to treat without assessing first.
  
- **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: This action directly addresses Ross's condition. By treating him correctly, Hathaway ensures that Ross becomes healthy, which is a key part of his goal.

- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to ensure that Young is also evaluated and treated if needed. It helps Hathaway manage his workload and ensure that all patients are accounted for.
