To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in a room where they can interact with the items.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Alex to have an item that can be used to trade or give away.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is important for Alex to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is crucial because it helps Casey to be happy, which in turn will help Alex achieve their goal since Casey wants Blake to be happy.

5. **tell(C3, C2, I1, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to ensure that Blake understands what Alex desires.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
