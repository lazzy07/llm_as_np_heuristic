To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **put_down(C2, I1, R22)**: Casey puts down the flowers in the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but can be included for clarity, as it shows that Casey no longer holds the flowers after giving them to Alex.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the flowers.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by providing them with the item they want.
- **put_down(C2, I1, R22)**: This action is included to show that Casey has completed the transaction and is no longer holding the flowers.
