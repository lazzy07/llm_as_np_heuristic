To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room A**: Ross will walk to Exam Room A to be assessed by Hathaway. This is necessary to ensure that Ross also receives the appropriate treatment for his condition.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is important for the same reason as assessing Jones.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that Ross also has a chance to become healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Jones)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat(Jones)**: Hathaway treats Jones based on the assessment.
3. **Walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**: Ross walks to Exam Room A.
4. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms.
5. **Treat(Ross)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment.

By following these actions, both Jones and Ross will have the opportunity to become healthy, achieving their goals.
