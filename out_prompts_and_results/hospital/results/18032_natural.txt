**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room B. Young is also in Patient Room B, but Dr. Hathaway is unaware of Young's symptoms. To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions take place:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess Young to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is taken. If Young actually has Flaze, this treatment will make Young healthy. If Young has Jarkis, this treatment will lead to Young's death. However, the goal is to ensure Young is alive and healthy, so we assume Young has Flaze.

3. **Young walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - After being treated, Young walks to Admissions to check on Jones and Ross, ensuring they are also alive and healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway follows Young to Admissions to check on the other patients and ensure they receive the necessary care.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young is crucial to identify the disease and provide the correct treatment.
- Treating Young is the next step to ensure Young's health, even if it involves a risk of misdiagnosis.
- Young walking to Admissions allows them to check on the status of other patients, reinforcing the theme of health and survival.
- Dr. Hathaway's movement to Admissions signifies the continuation of care for all patients.
