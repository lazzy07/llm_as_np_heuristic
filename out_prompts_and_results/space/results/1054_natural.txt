To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to remain friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.**  
   - This action is necessary for Zoe to be on the surface where the volcano is located, allowing the eruption to affect her.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.**  
   - This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**  
   - This action results in Zoe's death, which is a necessary outcome of the volcano erupting.

4. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.**  
   - After the eruption, the Lizard can safely move to the cave, ensuring it survives and can reflect on the events.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe (in spirit).**  
   - Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard can still honor their friendship and make peace with her memory, ensuring that their bond remains intact.

This sequence of actions leads to the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard making peace with Zoe, thus fulfilling the story's requirements.
