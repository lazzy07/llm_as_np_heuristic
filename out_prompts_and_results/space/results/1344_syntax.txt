To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action initiates the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It sets the stage for the impending danger that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave, which is a safe location away from the volcano. This action is necessary for Zoe to avoid the eruption and to potentially interact with the Lizard in a non-threatening environment.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard also walks to the cave, following Zoe. This action is crucial as it brings both characters together in the cave, allowing for a potential friendship to develop.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can now make peace. This action signifies the resolution of any previous tensions and establishes a friendship between them.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano erupts. Since Zoe is in the cave, she is safe, but the Lizard, who is still on the surface, will be caught in the eruption and die.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the volcanic eruption, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Moves Zoe to safety and allows for interaction with the Lizard.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: Brings the Lizard to the cave, facilitating the friendship.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their goals of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Concludes the story with the eruption, resulting in the Lizard's death.
