To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Vince is in the cave with Gargax, and Gargax can eat him. This action will fulfill Gargax's hunger and also allow Gargax to take the money that Vince has.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money that Vince had. This will increase Gargax's wealth.

With these two actions, Gargax will achieve their goal of being wealthy (by acquiring Vince's money) and not hungry (by eating Vince).
