   - This action is necessary because Blake believes the chocolates are in the bathroom, and they need to go there to find them.

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the bathroom.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates.

3. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to return to the living room to be with Alex and Casey after obtaining the chocolates.

4. **Blake gives chocolates to Alex in the living room.**
