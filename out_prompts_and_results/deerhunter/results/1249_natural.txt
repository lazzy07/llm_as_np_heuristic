To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money. Since Bubba is currently at the forest and the bank clerk is at the bank with 1 money, Bubba can go back to the bank and steal the money from the clerk using the rifle. Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk, who has the money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate him and take the money.
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the threat and take the money.
- **Steal the money:** This final action fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring 1 money.
