**Story Completion:**

After Talia and Rory arrive at the cave, they notice Gargax, the dragon, guarding the treasure. Talia, wanting to be wealthy, decides to take action. 

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** (This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.)
2. **Gargax eats Talia.** (This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human and is at the cave with Talia.)
3. **Rory, seeing Talia is gone, becomes hungry.** (This action reflects Rory's emotional state after losing Talia, but it does not affect Talia's goal.)
4. **Rory takes the money from Vince.** (This action allows Rory to gain wealth, but it is not directly related to Talia's goal.)

At the end of these actions, Talia has achieved her goal of being wealthy by picking up the treasure, even though she is eaten by Gargax.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Talia picks up the treasure to fulfill her desire for wealth.
- Gargax eats Talia, which is a consequence of Talia's action but does not prevent her from achieving her goal.
- Rory becomes hungry, which is a reaction to Talia's fate but does not impact Talia's wealth.
- Rory takes the money from Vince, which is a separate action that does not affect Talia's goal but shows the ongoing dynamics among the characters.
