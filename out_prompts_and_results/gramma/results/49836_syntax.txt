To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit is already at the crossroads, so she will walk to the market where Tom and the merchant are located. This is necessary for the bandit to interact with Tom and take his coin.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is carrying a coin. Since Tom is armed but does not have a sword, the bandit can successfully take the coin from him. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the crossroads. This is necessary for her to return to her preferred location.

4. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coin she just acquired from Tom and place it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.

- Walking back to the crossroads is necessary to return to her preferred location.
- Taking the coin to the chest at the bandit camp ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins stored.
