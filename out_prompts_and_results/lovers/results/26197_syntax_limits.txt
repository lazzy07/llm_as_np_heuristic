In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (flowers) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with item I3 (jewelry). Blake (C2) wants item I2 (chocolates) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade item I3 (jewelry) that they received from Casey for item I1 (flowers) that they want. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

The action will be executed as follows:

- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry they received from Casey for the flowers they want. After this trade, Alex will have the flowers and will be happy.

After this action, the situation will be:

- Alex (C1) is now happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) still wants chocolates (I2) and is not happy.
- Casey (C3) remains happy with the jewelry (I3).

This single action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.
