**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. With the workload at 3, Hathaway must be cautious to avoid misdiagnosing.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats both Jones and Young with the appropriate treatments based on their symptoms. Since both patients are experiencing Unknown, Hathaway treats them with antibiotics for Flaze, believing it to be the correct treatment. 

Both patients become healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
