Tom is at the Crossroads, determined to get to the cottage while carrying the medicine. The Bandit is also at the Crossroads, having just attacked the Merchant. Tom knows that the Merchant has the medicine he needs, but he must act quickly to avoid the Bandit.

To achieve his goal, Tom decides to report the Bandit's location to the Guard, who is at the Market. This action is crucial because it will bring the Guard to the Crossroads, where he can confront the Bandit. Once the Guard arrives, he can deal with the Bandit, allowing Tom to safely retrieve the medicine from the Merchant's corpse.

Tom reports the Bandit’s location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit will be dealt with. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of getting the medicine without facing the Bandit directly.

After reporting, the Guard will arrive at the Crossroads, and since the Bandit is a criminal, the Guard will attack and kill the Bandit. With the Bandit out of the way, Tom can then loot the medicine from the Merchant's corpse, fulfilling his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "report(Tom, Crossroads, Market)"
  ]
}
``` 

This single action sets off a chain of events that ultimately allows Tom to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine back to the cottage safely.
