**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients waiting in Admissions, specifically Jones and Ross, who are both experiencing unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat him. This increases the workload to 2, which is still manageable.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Ross as well. The workload increases to 3, but it is still within the limit to avoid mistakes.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Jones in Patient Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the assumption that he might have either Flaze or Jarkis.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. If Jones actually has Flaze, he will become healthy. If he has Jarkis, he will die. However, this is a necessary risk to take to help Jones.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross in Patient Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Similar to Jones, Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis (rash), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids. If Ross actually has Jarkis, he will become healthy. If he has Flaze, he will die. Again, this is a necessary risk to take to help Ross.

10. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
    - Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to check on Young.

11. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
    - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young's symptoms, which are still unknown.

12. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics.**  
    - Assuming Young has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. If Young actually has Flaze, he will become healthy. If he has Jarkis, he will die. This is the final necessary action to ensure all patients are treated.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat all patients, aiming for their health. The risks taken with the treatments are necessary due to the unknown symptoms, but they are the only way to potentially save the patients.
