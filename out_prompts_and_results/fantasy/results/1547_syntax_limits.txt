To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage or wealth through acquiring treasure. Since Talia is currently in the cave where the treasure is located, we can have her take the treasure, which will make her wealthy. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy, as she now possesses the treasure.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This action is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially increase her happiness.

3. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince, who has proposed to Talia, can now marry her since she is back in the village. This action makes both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

By taking these actions, Talia becomes wealthy by acquiring the treasure and also becomes happy through marriage to Vince.
