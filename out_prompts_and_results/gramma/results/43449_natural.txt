To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit reports the hero's location to the guard.**  
   - This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate the hero, who is a criminal and poses a threat. By reporting the hero's location, the guard can take action against the hero.

2. **The guard attacks the hero.**  
   - The guard, upon receiving the information from the bandit, will attack the hero. This is necessary for the bandit to eliminate the hero and take their coin.

3. **The guard kills the hero.**  
   - This action is crucial as it removes the hero from the scene, allowing the bandit to loot the hero's coin without any resistance.

4. **The bandit loots the hero's coin from the corpse.**  
   - After the hero is dead, the bandit can now take the hero's coin, which fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of acquiring coins while eliminating the threat posed by the hero.
