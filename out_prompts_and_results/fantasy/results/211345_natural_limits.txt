In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to ensure he has both the treasure and the money, as well as maintain his happiness. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.** - This action is taken because Gargax, who is at the cave with Talia, is hungry and wants to eat Rory. By eating Rory, Gargax can satisfy his hunger, and Rory, being dead, will no longer have the treasure. However, since Rory is now dead, he cannot be happy or wealthy anymore, but this action is necessary for Gargax to fulfill his goal of not being hungry.

In this scenario, Rory's goal of being happy and wealthy is ultimately not achieved because he is eaten by Gargax. However, the story is complete with the actions taken.
