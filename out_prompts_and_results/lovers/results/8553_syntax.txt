To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is in an unknown location, and Blake is currently in R22. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where the jewelry (I2) is believed to be located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room (R12). This action is necessary because Blake wants the jewelry, and Casey needs to have it to give it to Blake.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Blake is located. This action is necessary to deliver the jewelry to Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of being happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry they want, making them happy.
