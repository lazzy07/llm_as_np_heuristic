To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary to allow Zoe to interact with the Lizard, who is currently on the surface. It also puts her in a position to witness the eruption of the volcano.

2. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave**: This action allows Zoe to explore the cave, which may provide her with insights or opportunities to communicate with the Lizard.

3. **Zoe walks from the cave back to the surface**: Zoe returns to the surface to confront the Lizard and potentially make peace.

4. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard on the surface**: This action is crucial as it allows both characters to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

5. **The volcano erupts**: This action is the climax of the story, leading to the death of one character. Since Zoe is on the surface with the Lizard, the eruption will affect both of them.

6. **Zoe dies due to the eruption**: This is the final outcome of the story, where Zoe's desire for friendship leads her to the surface, ultimately resulting in her demise.

The sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, one character dying, and the two characters making friends before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
```
