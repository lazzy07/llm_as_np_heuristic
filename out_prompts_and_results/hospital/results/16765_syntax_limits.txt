In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. However, the goal is to treat the patients correctly to achieve health for all.

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment. Since Young is the only patient in Exam Room A, this action is straightforward.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to making Young healthy.

3. **Walk to Exam Room B and Assess Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room B to assess Ross. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can successfully treat both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
