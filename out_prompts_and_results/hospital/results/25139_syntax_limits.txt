To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake in diagnosing Ross if they assess him. However, since Ross is the only patient in Exam Room B, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to their high workload, they will treat him incorrectly, which could lead to his death. However, if they correctly assess him and find he has Jarkis, they will treat him with steroids, which will make him healthy. This action is crucial to ensure that Ross is treated appropriately.

Given that the goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, the actions taken will lead to either a successful treatment or a mistake, but the focus is on the attempt to treat Ross.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment. It is the first step in the process of ensuring all patients are healthy.
- **Treat Ross**: This action is the culmination of the assessment. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, Hathaway will either successfully treat Ross or make a mistake, but it is essential for the goal of making patients healthy.
