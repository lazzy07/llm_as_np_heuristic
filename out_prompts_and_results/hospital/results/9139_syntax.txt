To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room so that Hathaway can assess and treat him. 
2. **Admit Jones to Exam Room C**: Similarly, this action assigns Jones to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat him as well.
3. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. Since Young is already assigned to Exam Room A, this action is valid.
4. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to provide the correct treatment.
5. **Assess Jones in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms, which is essential for his treatment.
6. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: If Young shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.
7. **Treat Ross with steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.
8. **Treat Jones with steroids**: If Jones shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

Now, let's assume the following symptoms for the sake of this story:
- Young has a fever (Flaze).
- Ross has a rash (Jarkis).
- Jones has a rash (Jarkis).

With these assumptions, the actions will lead to the following outcomes:
- Young will be treated successfully and become healthy.
- Ross will be treated successfully and become healthy.
- Jones will be treated successfully and become healthy.

Thus, all patients will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
