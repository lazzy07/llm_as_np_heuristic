Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to his high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, but fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis and remains alive. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B and assesses him. Ross is also experiencing Unknown, and Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room A. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing Unknown, and mistakenly believes he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, but Young remains alive.

In the end, all patients are alive, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
