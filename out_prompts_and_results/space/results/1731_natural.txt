Zoe is at the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. To ensure her safety and to foster a friendship with the Lizard, she decides to take the following actions:

1. **Zoe teleports to the cave.** This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to reach the Lizard safely without being harmed by the erupting surface. By teleporting, she avoids the immediate danger and can engage with the Lizard in a safe environment.

2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard and initiates a conversation.** This action is crucial for establishing a connection with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, this is an opportunity for Zoe to express her desire for friendship and cooperation.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** This action solidifies their relationship, allowing both characters to achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends. By making peace, they can work together to ensure their mutual safety and well-being.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard leave the cave together to a safe location.** This final action ensures that both characters are out of danger from the erupting volcano and can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.

The sequence of actions leads to Zoe achieving her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
