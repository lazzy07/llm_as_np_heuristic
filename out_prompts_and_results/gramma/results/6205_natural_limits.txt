**Story Completion:**

The bandit, realizing that the market is crowded and the guard is nearby, decides to take a risk. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she sees the merchant and the guard. The bandit quickly assesses the situation and notices that the merchant is armed but the guard is distracted by a conversation with a customer. 

1. The bandit approaches the merchant and, with her sword drawn, she robs the merchant, taking the hero's coin. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

2. With the coin in hand, the bandit then walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely store her loot in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is crucial for securing her coins away from the market and the guard.

3. Finally, the bandit places the coin in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (robbing the merchant) is essential for the bandit to acquire coins without being killed, as the merchant is not carrying a sword.
- The second action (walking back to the crossroads) is necessary to escape the market and avoid confrontation with the guard.
- The third action (placing the coin in the chest) fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins secured in her camp.
