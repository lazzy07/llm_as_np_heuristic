**Story Completion:**

As Roy stands in the locked gym with the knife in hand, he knows he must act quickly to protect both himself and Ernest from the bully's threats. He decides to confront the bully directly. 

Roy approaches the bully, who is unaware of the danger he is in. With a swift motion, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now focus on escaping. He takes a moment to catch his breath, then unlocks the gym door and heads back to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. He then crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. 

Finally, wearing the civilian clothes, Roy steps onto the highway and successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
