**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Fever, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomA. Since Young is in the same room as Hathaway, this action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Given that Young is alive and healthy, this assessment will help Hathaway identify if Young has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). 

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young, Hathaway determines that Young has a fever, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Young to achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

3. **Walk(Young, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: After being treated successfully, Young walks to the admissions room to inform the staff of their recovery and to check on the status of the other patients, ensuring that they are also on the path to health.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary to identify Young's condition, which is essential for providing the correct treatment.
- The second action is critical as it directly leads to Young's recovery, fulfilling their goal of being alive and healthy.
- The third action allows Young to leave the exam room and check on the other patients, reinforcing their commitment to health and well-being.
