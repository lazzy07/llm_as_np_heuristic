In this story, Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and wants to be wealthy. The treasure is located in the cave, where Gargax currently is. The simplest way for Gargax to achieve their goal is to eat one of the humans who are at the cave, as this will not only satisfy Gargax's hunger but also allow them to take the treasure afterward.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Gargax eats Talia.

This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. By eating Talia, Gargax can then take the treasure that is at the cave, thus achieving their goal of being wealthy.

After this action, Gargax will have the treasure, satisfying both their hunger and their desire for wealth.
