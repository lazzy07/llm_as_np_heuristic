In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all hospital patients are healthy. The current situation involves Young, who has been assessed and shows symptoms of a rash (SymptomB), which indicates he has Jarkis. Hathaway's workload is currently at 2, allowing for the possibility of treating Young without making a mistake.

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will take the following actions:

1. **Treat Young for Jarkis**: Since Young has been assessed and shows symptoms of Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

2. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are currently waiting there. This action is necessary to ensure that Hathaway can continue to help the other patients and maintain their health.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy. After this treatment, Young will be healthy.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to check on Jones and Ross. This action is necessary for Hathaway to continue his work and ensure that all patients receive the care they need.

After these actions, Young will be healthy, and Hathaway will be in a position to assess and treat the other patients, thus achieving his goal.
