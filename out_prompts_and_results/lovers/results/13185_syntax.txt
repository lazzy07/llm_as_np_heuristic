To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the item they want.
2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room.
3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room (R22) to interact with Casey and Blake.
4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C2) to make them happy.
5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the jewelry (I1).
6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room.
7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room (R22) to give the jewelry to Alex.
8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1), making Alex happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the dining room to pick up the chocolates, which is the only item they can use to help Casey.
- **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates to give them to Casey, which is a step towards making both of them happy.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to return to the living room to interact with Casey and Blake.
- **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: By giving the chocolates to Casey, Alex helps Casey achieve happiness, which is important for their own happiness.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to move to the dining room to pick up the jewelry, which is the item Alex wants.
- **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry, which is necessary for Alex's happiness.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room to give the jewelry to Alex.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This final action ensures that Alex receives the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
