Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing an unknown condition, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to correctly identify that Young has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. With a workload of 1, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. However, since Jones does not have Jarkis, he dies. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A to admit Ross. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. With a workload of 1, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of treating patients, but unfortunately, one patient dies due to a misdiagnosis. The actions taken are necessary to show the process of assessment and treatment, which are critical to the hospital's function.
