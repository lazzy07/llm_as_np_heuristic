In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Casey moves to the dining room (R21)**: Since Casey is currently in the living room (R22) and wants to be happy, they need to move to the room where the jewelry is located. 

2. **Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21)**: Now that Casey is in the dining room, they can pick up the jewelry, which is the item they want to be happy.

After these actions, Casey is happy because they have obtained the jewelry. 

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to reach the dining room where the jewelry is located.
- **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: This action allows Casey to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.

Now, Casey is happy, and since they want Blake to be happy, they can later give the jewelry to Blake if needed, but for the purpose of this story, Casey achieving their goal is sufficient.
