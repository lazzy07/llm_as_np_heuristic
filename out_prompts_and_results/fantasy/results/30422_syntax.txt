To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Rory and the money that Vince possesses. Since Talia is already married to Rory, her happiness is guaranteed through their relationship. However, to also make her wealthy, we can facilitate a transfer of money from Vince to Talia.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince will travel to the cave to pick up the treasure. This action is necessary because Vince needs to be at the cave to access the treasure, which can potentially increase Talia's wealth.

2. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure. This is essential as it allows Vince to have the treasure, which can later be transferred to Talia.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for him to be in the same location as Talia, allowing for the next action.

4. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial because it directly increases Talia's wealth, fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.

5. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry, which is a necessary action to set up the next event.

6. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to remove Vince from the story, as he is no longer needed after transferring the money to Talia. It also aligns with Gargax's goal of not being hungry.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy due to the money she took from Vince, and she will remain happy because she is married to Rory.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince needs to go to the cave to collect the treasure.
- **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure to potentially increase Talia's wealth.
- **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince returns to the village to be with Talia.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince, making her wealthy.
- **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax's hunger sets up the next action.
- **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax eats Vince, removing him from the story and fulfilling his hunger.
