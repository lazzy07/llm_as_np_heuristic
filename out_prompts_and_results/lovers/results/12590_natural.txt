To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives jewelry to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry, and Blake currently has it. By giving the jewelry to Casey, Blake helps both Casey achieve happiness and also moves closer to his own happiness by potentially receiving chocolates later.

2. **Alex moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Alex to pursue their goal of obtaining chocolates, which are located in the dining room. It also keeps the story moving forward without interfering with Casey's goal.

3. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - Blake follows Alex to the dining room, which allows him to pursue the chocolates as well. This action does not affect Casey's happiness but keeps the characters engaged in their goals.

4. **Alex picks up chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Alex to achieve happiness, as they want the chocolates. 

5. **Blake picks up chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to show that Blake is also pursuing the chocolates, which aligns with his goal of being happy.

At the end of these actions, Casey has the jewelry and is happy, while Alex and Blake are also working towards their own happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

    "Blake picks up chocolates in the dining room."
  ]
}

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry, while also allowing Alex and Blake to pursue their own happiness.
