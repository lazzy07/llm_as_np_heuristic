To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure located in the cave. This action is essential for Talia to become wealthy, as she currently has no wealth.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially secure her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, who has already proposed to her. This action will make both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

4. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is not directly related to Talia's goals but is included to show that characters can experience hunger, which may lead to further actions.

5. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, which eliminates one character from the story. This action is included to show the potential danger in the cave and to simplify the narrative by removing a character.

By following these actions, Talia successfully achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy through marriage and acquiring treasure.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)",

    "marry(Talia, Vince, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Vince)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure Talia's happiness and wealth while also maintaining the integrity of the story's constraints.
