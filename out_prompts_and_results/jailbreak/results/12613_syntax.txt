To achieve the goal of either Ernest or Roy overcoming the bully's threats or one of them dying, we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Roy is in the hallway and can lock the gym door, preventing the bully from leaving. This action is crucial as it isolates the bully and allows Roy to confront him without the risk of escape.

2. **revenge(Roy, Bully, Gym)**: With the gym locked, Roy can now kill the bully using the knife he stole from the kitchen. This action is necessary to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer in danger.

3. **next_day()**: Transition to day two. This action signifies the end of day one and the beginning of a new day, allowing for the story to progress.

4. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**: Roy can now put on the civilian clothes he finds in the laundry room. This disguise is essential for his escape from the prison.

5. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Finally, Roy can escape from the prison using the disguise. This action fulfills the goal of ensuring that at least one character survives and overcomes the bully's threats.

This sequence of actions leads to Roy successfully killing the bully and escaping the prison, thus achieving the desired outcome of overcoming the threats.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **lock_gym**: Isolates the bully, allowing Roy to confront him without interference.
- **revenge**: Eliminates the bully, removing the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest.
- **next_day**: Marks the transition to a new day, allowing for further actions.
- **disguise**: Prepares Roy for a successful escape from the prison.
- **escape**: Achieves the ultimate goal of survival and freedom.
