**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes and on the highway, feels a rush of adrenaline. He knows he must escape before the bully finds out what he has done. 

1. **Roy escapes from the prison.** 
   - This action is crucial as it allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free. He uses the disguise to blend in and avoid detection.

Meanwhile, back in the prison:

2. **Ernest does his chores in the laundry room.**
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to avoid punishment from the guards and to ensure he remains safe from the bully's threats.

3. **The bully, realizing that Roy has stolen his cigarettes and is now missing, becomes enraged and starts looking for him.** 
   - This action is implied as it sets the stage for the bully's reaction to Roy's escape, but it does not directly affect Roy's success.

By the end of the day, Roy is safely outside the prison, having successfully escaped without being caught. Ernest, while still in the prison, has managed to stay out of trouble for now.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Roy's escape is the primary action that leads to his goal of being alive and free. 
- Ernest doing his chores is a necessary action to ensure he does not face the bully's wrath or punishment from the guards, keeping him safe while Roy successfully escapes.
