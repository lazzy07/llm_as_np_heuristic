Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure his survival. He knows that the bully believes he is in the laundry room, which gives him an opportunity to act without immediate danger. 

Ernest takes the following action:

1. **Crawl through the vents to the gym**: This allows Ernest to move to the gym without being seen by the bully, who is currently unaware of his presence in the hallway. 

Once in the gym, Ernest can confront the bully without being threatened. He has the knife, which he can use to defend himself.

2. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Roy, allowing Ernest to feel safe and secure.

After killing the bully, Ernest can return to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This will enable him to escape from the prison on the highway.

3. **Put on the civilian clothes**: This disguises Ernest, making it safe for him to leave the prison.

4. **Crawl through the vents to the highway**: This final action allows Ernest to escape from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

In summary, the actions taken by Ernest are necessary to eliminate the threat from the bully and to secure his escape from the prison.
