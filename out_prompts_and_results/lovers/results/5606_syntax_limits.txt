In the current situation, Casey (C3) wants the jewelry (I3) that is with Alex (C1). To achieve this, Casey can take the following action:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R12)**: Casey can trade the flowers (I1) they have with Alex for the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be unhappy because they wanted the chocolates (I2).
- Blake (C2) will still be unhappy because they wanted the chocolates (I2) as well.
- Casey will be happy because they now have the jewelry (I3).

This single action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.
