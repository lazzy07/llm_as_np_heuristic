To achieve Blake's goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy, we need to focus on the items they want. Blake wants chocolates (I2), and Alex wants flowers (I1). Since Alex is currently unhappy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the flowers, which will make them happy. 

Here's the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2) that are there.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room.
3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) where Alex and Casey are.
4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the flowers (I1) that they want.
5. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to pick up the flowers (I1).
6. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room, making them happy.
7. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Blake and Casey.
8. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3), making Casey happy.

At this point, Blake is happy because they have given chocolates to Alex, who is now happy with the flowers.
