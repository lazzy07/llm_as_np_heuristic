**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, first admits Jones to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, since Hathaway's workload is now 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Unfortunately, this treatment does not match Ross's actual condition, and he dies.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Young in Patient Room B. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 2, Hathaway correctly identifies Young's condition as Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young recovers and becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway treats him with steroids, mistakenly believing he has Jarkis. However, Jones does not have Jarkis, and he dies.

In the end, only Young is healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has done their best to treat the patients, achieving their goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
