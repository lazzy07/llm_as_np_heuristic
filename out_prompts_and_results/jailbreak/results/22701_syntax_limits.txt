**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, who is currently in the hallway, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym, and he has the pack of cigarettes that he stole from the bully earlier. To ensure his safety and to avoid any threats from the bully, Roy takes a bold step. He locks the gym door, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. 

With the bully trapped, Roy feels a sense of relief. He then decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. This disguise will allow him to escape from the prison without being recognized.
