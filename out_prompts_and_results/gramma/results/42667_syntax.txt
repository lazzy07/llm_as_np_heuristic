To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine, and by walking to the cottage, he fulfills his goal of being there with the medicine.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it directly moves Tom from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be. Since he already possesses the medicine, this action completes his objective.
