To complete the story, we need to ensure that the U.S. Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant while the Nazis remain dead. Given the current situation, the U.S. Army already has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead, so we need to ensure that the U.S. Army keeps the Ark safe and that the Nazis do not return or interfere.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Indiana Jones travels from the USA to Tanis.**  
   - This action is necessary for Indiana to investigate the situation further and ensure that the Ark remains safe from any potential threats, even though the Nazis are already dead.

2. **Indiana Jones digs up the Ark in Tanis.**  
   - This action is included to confirm that the Ark is indeed dangerous and to ensure that it is not mistakenly believed to be safe. However, since the Nazis are already dead and the U.S. Army has the Ark, this action serves more as a precautionary measure.

3. **Indiana Jones travels back from Tanis to the USA.**  
   - This action allows Indiana to return to the U.S. and check on the U.S. Army's handling of the Ark.

4. **Indiana Jones opens the Ark.**  
   - This action is included to confirm the Ark's dangerous nature. Since the Ark is dangerous, Indiana will die, but this action serves to solidify the narrative that the Ark is indeed a perilous item, ensuring that the U.S. Army will take it seriously.

5. **The U.S. Army secures the Ark.**  
   - This action is implied as the U.S. Army, having witnessed the consequences of opening the Ark, will take measures to ensure it is kept safe and secure, thus retaining possession of the Ark.

At the end of these actions, the U.S. Army has the Ark, and Indiana Jones has sacrificed himself to confirm the Ark's danger, ensuring that the Nazis remain dead and cannot return.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling to Tanis and back**: This allows Indiana to confirm the status of the Ark and the situation with the Nazis.
- **Digging up the Ark**: This action serves to reinforce the Ark's dangerous nature, even though it is already known.
- **Opening the Ark**: This action leads to Indiana's demise, confirming the Ark's danger and ensuring that the U.S. Army understands the risks involved.
- **Securing the Ark**: This is a necessary action to ensure the Ark remains in the U.S. Army's possession and is treated with the caution it deserves.
