To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to identify Jones's condition.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever). This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones**: This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify the symptoms of Jones, which is necessary for determining the correct treatment. Even though there is a risk of misdiagnosis due to Hathaway's high workload, it is still the only way to proceed.
  
- **Treating Jones**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, treating him with antibiotics will make him healthy. This is the ultimate goal of Hathaway, and it is essential to ensure at least one patient is treated correctly.
