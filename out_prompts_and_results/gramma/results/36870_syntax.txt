To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to outline a series of actions that will allow him to do so without any unnecessary complications. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to achieve his goal. This action moves him directly to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why this action is included:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This is the only necessary action for Tom to reach the Cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine. Since he already has the medicine in his possession, walking to the Cottage fulfills his goal.

No other actions are needed because:
- The Merchant and Guard are at the Market, and the Bandit is already dead, so there are no threats or complications for Tom to deal with.
- Tom is already armed and does not need to engage in any combat or theft to achieve his goal.

Thus, the story is complete with just this one action.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
