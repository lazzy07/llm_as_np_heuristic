After the events that have transpired, Tom is in the Market with the Medicine he looted from the Bandit. The Guard is also present in the Market, and he is aware of Tom's actions. Since Tom is not a criminal and has the Medicine, he can safely walk back to the Cottage without any issues.

To achieve his goal of being at the Cottage carrying the Medicine, Tom will take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to leave the Market and head directly to the Cottage, where he wants to be carrying the Medicine.

This action is necessary because it fulfills Tom's goal of being at the Cottage with the Medicine. Since there are no threats to him at this point, he can safely make this journey.
