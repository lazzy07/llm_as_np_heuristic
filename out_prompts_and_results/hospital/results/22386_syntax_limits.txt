**Story Completion:**

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Hathaway's workload increases to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C. This action is also necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room. Hathaway's workload increases to 3, which is still manageable, but close to the threshold where mistakes could occur.

3. **Assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B. This action is crucial to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment. Assuming Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway correctly identifies the disease.

4. **Treat(Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids for Jarkis. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy. Since the treatment matches the symptoms, Ross recovers successfully.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (admitting Ross and Young) are essential for ensuring that all patients are in the correct exam rooms for assessment and treatment.
- The assessment of Ross is critical to identify his symptoms accurately, which is necessary for effective treatment.
- The treatment of Ross with the correct medication ensures that he becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
