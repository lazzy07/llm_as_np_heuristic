Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety and strengthen their friendship.

1. **Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard.** This action is taken to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, where they can talk and bond further. The cave is a secure place that can protect them from the imminent eruption.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures that they remain allies, which is crucial for their safety and mutual support.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave.** This action allows them to stay safe from the erupting volcano. They can share stories and learn more about each other, which helps to solidify their friendship.

4. **The volcano erupts.** Since they are in the cave, they are safe from the eruption, which would have been dangerous if they were still on the surface.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard. They both find safety in the cave, and their friendship grows stronger as they share this experience.
