Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano on the surface, decides to take action to help the Lizard. She teleports from the cave to the surface, where she sees the Lizard struggling with the impending eruption. Instead of attacking or stunning the Lizard, Zoe approaches with a friendly demeanor, hoping to make peace. The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, agrees to put aside their differences. They both work together to find a safe spot away from the volcano.

As they move, the volcano erupts, and the ground shakes violently. In the chaos, the Lizard is injured but survives, while Zoe manages to teleport back to the cave just in time to avoid the lava flow. The Lizard, now realizing that Zoe is not a threat but a potential ally, calls out to her, and they establish a friendship based on mutual respect and the shared experience of surviving the eruption.
