In the living room, Casey sees the flowers that Alex wants. Knowing that Alex is not happy and wants the flowers, Casey decides to help Alex by picking up the flowers. This action will not directly make Casey happy, but it will create an opportunity for Alex to be happy, which is important to Casey. 

Next, Casey tells Alex that the flowers are beautiful and suggests that Alex should take them. This action is a lie because Casey actually wants the jewelry, but it helps to create a positive atmosphere. 

Finally, Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates, which Blake wants. By doing this, Casey can then give the chocolates to Blake, making Blake happy.
