To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, we can see that Casey is in the living room (R21) and has no items, while Alex is in the dining room (R22) and is happy with the flowers (I1) they received from Casey. Blake is also in the living room (R21) but is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2) that are currently in the living room.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake (C2) can trade the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey (C3) wants. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, which is the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: After the trade, Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
