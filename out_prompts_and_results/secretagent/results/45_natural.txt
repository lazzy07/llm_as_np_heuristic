To complete the story with the specified ending, we need to ensure that the secret agent successfully kills the mastermind. The actions taken by the secret agent are already sufficient to achieve this goal, as the secret agent has already moved to the office and killed the mastermind. 

Here’s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **The secret agent moves from the headquarters to the dropbox.** 
   - This action sets the stage for the secret agent to gather necessary items.

2. **The secret agent picks up the papers.**
   - The papers are essential for the secret agent's mission, possibly containing information about the mastermind.

3. **The secret agent moves from the dropbox to the courtyard.**
   - This movement allows the secret agent to navigate towards the lobby, where the gun is located.

4. **The secret agent moves from the courtyard to the lobby.**
   - The secret agent is now in the lobby, where they can find the gun.

5. **The secret agent finds the gun in the lobby.**
   - Finding the gun is crucial for the secret agent to carry out their goal of killing the mastermind.

6. **The secret agent picks up the gun.**
   - Now armed, the secret agent is ready to confront the mastermind.
