To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money. Since the bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, Bubba can go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to take the money from the clerk. This action is implicit in the previous action of stealing, but it emphasizes Bubba's greed and his ultimate goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk.
4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
