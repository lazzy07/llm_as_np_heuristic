To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, hereâ€™s a concise story that leads to that outcome:

1. **Action: move(C2, R12, R21)** - Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with the other characters and potentially receive the item they want.

2. **Action: give(C3, I3, C2, R21)** - Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the living room (R21). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
- Alex and Blake are still unhappy, but their happiness is not the goal of this story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: This action is essential for Casey to be in the same room as Blake, who has the jewelry. Without this movement, Casey cannot receive the item they want.
- **give(C3, I3, C2, R21)**: This action is the key to achieving Casey's happiness, as it directly provides them with the jewelry they desire.
