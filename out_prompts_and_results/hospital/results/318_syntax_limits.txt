In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The current situation involves two patients, Ross and Young, who are in exam rooms but have unknown symptoms. Jones is in the admissions room, and Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to achieve their goal.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then assesses Young in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young based on his symptoms. This is equally important to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By assessing both patients and treating them accordingly, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are healthy, thus achieving their goal.
