The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, sees the guard and realizes that she needs to secure her position and her coins. The bandit decides to take action to ensure she can keep her ill-gotten gains.

1. The bandit attacks the guard. (The bandit wants to eliminate the guard, who poses a threat to her freedom and her coins.)
2. The bandit loots the guard's sword from the corpse of the guard. (Now that the guard is dead, the bandit can take the sword to further protect herself and assert dominance.)
3. The bandit walks to the bandit camp. (The bandit wants to return to her camp to secure her coins and the medicine she has taken from the merchant.)

At this point, the bandit has successfully killed the guard, looted his sword, and returned to her camp, where she can safely store her coins and the medicine.
