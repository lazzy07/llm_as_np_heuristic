To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the bathroom where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Casey.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want (flowers).
- Blake is happy because they have given away the jewelry, which was not their desired item.
- Casey is now happy because they have received the jewelry.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
