To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This is essential as it allows Blake to have the item that Casey wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Casey is. This is necessary to give the jewelry to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
