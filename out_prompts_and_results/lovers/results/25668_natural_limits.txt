In the living room, Casey looks at Alex and Blake, both of whom are unhappy. Casey knows that Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since Casey already has the flowers, they decide to take action to achieve their goal.

Casey moves to Alex and gives the flowers to them. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to become happy by receiving the flowers they want.
