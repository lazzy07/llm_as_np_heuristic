To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire the treasure while also ensuring he is not hungry. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village to be closer to Talia, who has accepted his proposal. This action is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and potentially improve his happiness.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. This action makes both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the Cave to retrieve the treasure. This is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.

4. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

5. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger status is updated, even though it does not directly contribute to his goals.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to conclude the story, as it is a necessary outcome given the constraints of the characters and their desires.

In this story, Rory achieves his goal of happiness through marriage with Talia and wealth by picking up the treasure. However, he ultimately meets a tragic end due to Gargax, which is a necessary conclusion given the constraints of the characters.
