Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is currently experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway needs to determine what is wrong with him. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is the only patient in Patient Room A, Hathaway can focus on him without any distractions. 

After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to provide the correct treatment (antibiotics) for Ross's condition. By treating Ross, Hathaway ensures that he becomes healthy.

Now that Ross is healthy, Dr. Hathaway can turn her attention to the other patients.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can later assess and treat him, contributing to her goal of having all patients healthy.

At this point, Ross is healthy, and Young is now in an exam room, ready for assessment. 

**Final Explanation:**
- The actions taken are focused on assessing and treating Ross, which directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. Admitting Young sets the stage for future actions to help him as well.
