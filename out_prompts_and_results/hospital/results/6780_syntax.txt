To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their conditions.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will make Ross healthy.

5. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Jones is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Jones healthy.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well, ensuring he becomes healthy too.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
