To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which can lead to happiness through marriage.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory will travel to the cave to be with Talia, as he wants to be happy and wealthy, and he has a relationship with Talia.
2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia will marry Rory, as he has accepted her proposal. This will make both Talia and Rory happy.
3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince will travel back to the village, as he is not part of the marriage and will not be happy in the cave anymore.
4. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax, who is in the cave, will eat Vince. This action is necessary to ensure that Talia remains safe and that Vince does not interfere with Talia's happiness.

After these actions, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Rory, and she will be wealthy because she possesses the treasure. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling**: Rory's travel to the cave is essential for him to be present for the marriage. Vince's travel back to the village is necessary to remove him from the situation after the marriage.
- **Marrying**: The marriage between Talia and Rory is crucial for Talia to achieve happiness, as she has accepted Rory's proposal.
- **Eating**: Gargax eating Vince is a necessary action to eliminate any potential conflict or distraction that could arise from Vince's presence after Talia's marriage.
