Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the workload being 2, which is below the threshold for making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for Jones's actual condition (Flaze). As a result, Jones does not become healthy and dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C from Admissions. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis and treats him with steroids as well. Ross also does not become healthy and dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A from Admissions. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Young is experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young also does not become healthy and dies.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway's actions lead to the unfortunate outcome of all patients dying, which is not the intended goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. However, the actions taken are necessary to illustrate the consequences of the doctor's mistakes due to the workload.
