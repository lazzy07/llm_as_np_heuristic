**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite her heavy workload, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. She enters the room and examines Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload of 3, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, the treatment is incorrect. Fortunately, the treatment does not lead to Jones's death, but he remains unhealthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway realizes she needs to reduce her workload. She walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting there. She admits Ross to Patient Room B and assesses him. Ross is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is correct, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to check on Jones. She realizes her mistake and decides to treat Jones with the correct treatment, antibiotics for Flaze. This time, the treatment is successful, and Jones becomes healthy.
