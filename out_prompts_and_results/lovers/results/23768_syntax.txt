To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the bathroom (R21) to check on the chocolates (I2). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps Blake to potentially fulfill their own desire later.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R21) to be with Blake. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but keeps the characters together.

5. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the bathroom. This action helps Blake achieve their goal of happiness.

6. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action helps Casey achieve their goal of happiness.

7. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but keeps the group together.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted. The other characters can still pursue their happiness, but the focus is on Alex achieving their goal.
