**Story Completion:**

After Roy successfully disguised himself with civilian clothes and crawled through the vents to the highway, he found himself outside the prison. He took a moment to catch his breath, feeling the weight of his situation lift as he realized he was free. 

Meanwhile, inside the prison, Ernest remained in the cell block, feeling threatened by the bully. He knew he had to act quickly to ensure his own safety. He decided to go to the kitchen to retrieve the knife, hoping to defend himself if the bully came after him. 

On day two, with the knife in hand, Ernest moved to the gym, where he found the bully. In a moment of desperation and self-preservation, he confronted the bully and killed him, ensuring that he would no longer be threatened. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest felt a sense of relief. He then made his way to the hallway, where he crawled through the vents to the highway. There, he put on the civilian clothes he had found earlier, disguising himself. Finally, he escaped from the prison, joining Roy outside.
