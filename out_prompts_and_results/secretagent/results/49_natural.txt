To complete the story with the specified ending, we need to ensure that the secret agent successfully kills the mastermind. Since the events already indicate that the mastermind is dead, we can focus on the actions that lead to this conclusion and ensure that the secret agent retains the papers and the gun.

Here’s the completed story:

1. The secret agent is at the office with the gun and the papers.
2. The secret agent has already killed the mastermind in the office.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The secret agent's movement to the office and the act of killing the mastermind are crucial to achieving the goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead. Since the story already states that the mastermind is not alive, we can conclude that the secret agent has successfully completed their mission.

The actions taken are necessary to confirm the outcome of the story, which is that the mastermind is dead, and the secret agent is alive with the papers and the gun.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move to office",
    "kill mastermind"
  ]
}
```

In this case, the actions are implied rather than explicitly stated since the story already confirms the outcome of the secret agent killing the mastermind. The plan reflects the necessary actions to achieve the desired ending.
