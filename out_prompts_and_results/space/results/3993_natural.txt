Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have successfully made peace and become friends, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals of safety and friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the immediate threat.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends now, and Zoe's intention is to help the Lizard. She wants to ensure that the Lizard is also safe.

3. **Zoe walks with the Lizard to the cave.** - This action allows both characters to move to a safer location away from the erupting surface. The cave is a safer place for both Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their mutual goal of safety.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they remain allies, which is essential for their ongoing safety and health.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
