**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened because he has stolen the bully's pack of cigarettes. To ensure his safety and to avoid confrontation, Ernest decides to take action. He quickly crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he knows the bully is.

Once in the gym, Ernest locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he cannot threaten Ernest anymore. With the bully locked in, Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously planned to use for self-defense.
