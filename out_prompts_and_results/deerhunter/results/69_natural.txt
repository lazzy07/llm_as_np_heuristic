To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba picks up the ammunition.**  
   - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to load the rifle to be able to shoot. Without ammunition, he cannot threaten or kill anyone.

2. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.**  
   - Loading the rifle is essential for Bubba to be able to shoot. This action prepares him to take further aggressive actions.

3. **Bubba goes to the bank.**  
   - Bubba needs to confront the bank clerk to get the money. Moving to the bank is necessary to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.

5. **Bubba goes to the forest.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but can be included to show Bubba's escape after stealing the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, which fulfills the requirement.
