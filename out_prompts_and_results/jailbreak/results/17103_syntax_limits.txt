**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to make his move. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife hidden in his clothes. With the disguise on, he feels a surge of confidence. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he finds the bully alone, lifting weights.
