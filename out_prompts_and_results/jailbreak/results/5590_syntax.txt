**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself on the highway, where he has already crawled through the vents. He knows he needs to escape the prison to ensure his safety and that of his friend Ernest. 

1. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner, which is essential for his escape.

2. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: With the civilian clothes on, Roy makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison. This is the ultimate goal for Roy, as it ensures his survival and freedom.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising Roy is necessary to avoid detection by the guards and to facilitate his escape. Without the disguise, he would be easily recognized as a prisoner and would likely be caught.
- The second action of escaping is the culmination of Roy's efforts to ensure his safety and achieve his goal of being alive and free.
