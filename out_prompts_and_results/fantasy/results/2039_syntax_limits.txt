In this story, Rory is in the cave with the treasure he picked up, while Talia is in the village. Gargax, the dragon, is also in the village, and Vince is dead in the village with money on his body. Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. 

To achieve this, Rory can take the following actions:

1. **Travel from Cave to Village**: Rory needs to go to the village to interact with Talia and potentially propose marriage, which will make him happy.
2. **Propose marriage to Talia**: Rory proposes to Talia, who is in the village. This action is necessary for Rory to achieve happiness.
3. **Accept the proposal from Rory**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal, which results in both characters being happy.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goal of being happy, wealthy (since he has the treasure), and not hungry (as he is not in a state of hunger).
