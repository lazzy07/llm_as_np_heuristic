In the village, Gargax, the hungry dragon, sees Talia, Rory, and Vince. Gargax wants to eat, and since he is hungry, he decides to eat Vince, who has the money. This action will leave Talia and Rory alive but will also make Talia wealthy, as she will inherit Vince's money.

1. Gargax eats Vince. (This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and wants to eat a human. By eating Vince, he satisfies his hunger and removes a character who has money.)
2. Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body. (This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she needs to acquire the money that Vince had.)
3. Talia becomes happy. (This action is the result of Talia becoming wealthy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.)

With these actions, Talia achieves her goal of becoming happy and wealthy.
