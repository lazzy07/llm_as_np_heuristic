To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location.

The story is very straightforward because Tom already has the medicine and just needs to get to the cottage. There are no other characters taking actions that would interfere with Tom's goal, and since he is armed, he can safely walk without fear of being attacked.

Here’s the complete story:

1. Tom, having just acquired the medicine from the merchant, decides to head to the cottage. He walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, successfully reaching his destination while carrying the medicine.

At this point, Tom has achieved his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
``` 

This plan includes only the necessary action for Tom to achieve his goal, making it the shortest possible story.
