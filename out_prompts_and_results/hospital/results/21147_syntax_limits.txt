**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room B with Ross. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway decides to assess Ross first.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway believes it is essential to start the assessment process.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect since Ross actually has Flaze. Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's demise.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is waiting there. This time, Hathaway is more focused and correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition, even though it risks a misdiagnosis due to Hathaway's high workload.
- **Treat Ross**: Although this action results in a negative outcome for Ross, it is part of the story's progression and highlights the consequences of Hathaway's workload.
- **Assess Young**: This action is crucial for ensuring that Young receives the correct treatment, ultimately leading to a successful outcome and fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having healthy patients.
