To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This is necessary for Rory to access the treasure, which will contribute to their wealth.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly increases Rory's wealth, fulfilling one of their primary goals.

After these actions, Rory will have the treasure, making them wealthy, and since they are not hungry, they will also be happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action is essential for Rory to reach the treasure, which is located in the cave. Without this travel, Rory cannot access the treasure.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, thus achieving their goal of wealth. Since Rory is already happy from the acceptance of Talia's proposal, this action ensures that Rory's wealth goal is met.
