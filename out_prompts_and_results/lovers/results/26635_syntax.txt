To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22) to interact with them and potentially get the jewelry.
2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy.
3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12) after receiving the jewelry.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey and Blake, who have the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Casey to give the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: This action is simply to return to the bedroom after receiving the jewelry, but it does not affect the happiness outcome.
