To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bribe(President, Villain, Money)**: The villain uses the stolen money to bribe the president. This action is crucial because it allows the villain to gain control over the president by leveraging the money they have stolen.

2. **Coerce(Hero, President, Money)**: The hero, fearing the villain, is coerced into wanting the president to have the money. This action is included to show that the hero is manipulated into supporting the villain's control over the president, even if indirectly.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The villain threatens the hero, instilling fear and establishing dominance.
- The villain then steals the money from the bank, gaining a powerful resource.
- Using the stolen money, the villain bribes the president, successfully gaining control over him.
- The hero, fearing the villain, is coerced into wanting the president to have the money, further solidifying the villain's influence.

This sequence of actions leads to the villain successfully controlling the president, fulfilling the story's objective.
