To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey wants to be happy and needs to be in a position to either give or trade items.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room. This is important because Blake wants to help Alex and needs to be in a position to interact with Casey.

3. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Blake to have an item to trade or give to Casey.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is crucial because it makes Casey happy, which in turn helps Alex feel better about the situation.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex is happy because they now have the item they wanted.
