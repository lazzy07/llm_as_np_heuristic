There, he aims his rifle at Bambi, who is unaware of the danger. Bubba shoots Bambi, killing her. He then decides to eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger. With Bambi dead, Bubba can take the opportunity to collect the money he desires, as he believes that Bambi has money. However, since Bambi is a deer, she does not have any money.
