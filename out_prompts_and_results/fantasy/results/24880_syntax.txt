To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will help him secure wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village to access the money that Vince has. This is necessary for Rory to become wealthy, as he currently only has the treasure.

2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial because it allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of his primary goals.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia accepted Rory's proposal earlier, this action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

At this point, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is wealthy (having taken the money), happy (after marrying Talia), and not hungry (as he has not taken any actions that would make him hungry).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to go to the village to access the money, which is essential for his wealth.
- **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action directly increases Rory's wealth, which is one of his main goals.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness through marriage, as Talia accepted his proposal earlier.
