3. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (Vince needs to return to the village to share the treasure with Rory.)
4. **Vince gives the treasure to Rory.** (This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Rory's wealth.)
5. **Rory's happiness increases to 1.** (Rory is now wealthy and not hungry, fulfilling his goal.)
