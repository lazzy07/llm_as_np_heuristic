To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and knows that the medicine is with the Merchant at the Market. He needs to walk to the Market to buy the medicine.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: After arriving at the Market, Tom can buy the medicine from the Merchant using one of the coins he is carrying.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: With the medicine now in his possession, Tom needs to walk back to the Crossroads.

4. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being at the Cottage carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Tom to achieve his goal, as it involves only necessary movements and the purchase of the medicine.
