Zoe, realizing the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to teleport back to the spaceship for safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to his guardianship of the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, decides to confront Zoe at the surface.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. However, it angers the Lizard, setting the stage for conflict.
   
2. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard feels compelled to confront Zoe after her teleportation, as he believes she is a threat to the planet.

3. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - Zoe realizes she needs to communicate with the Lizard to resolve their conflict and make peace, despite the danger of the volcano.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - After Zoe's return, she explains her intentions to the Lizard, and they both realize they share the same goals of health, safety, and friendship. They agree to work together to ensure the safety of the planet and its inhabitants.

5. **The volcano erupts.** - As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, and Zoe is caught in the eruption, leading to her demise.

This sequence of actions leads to the ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing for the characters to make peace before the tragic event.
