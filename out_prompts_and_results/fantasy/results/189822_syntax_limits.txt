To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Travel from Cave to Village**: Rory is currently in the Village, and he needs to return to the Cave to be with Talia and Vince, who are both there. This action is necessary for Rory to interact with Talia and potentially resolve his relationship with her.

2. **Take Money from Vince**: Once Rory is back in the Cave, he can take the Money from Vince. This action is crucial because it will make Rory wealthy, fulfilling one of his primary goals.

3. **Marry Talia**: Since Rory has already proposed to Talia and she has accepted, they can now get married. This action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Rory travels from the Village to the Cave.
- Upon arriving at the Cave, Rory takes the Money from Vince.
- Finally, Rory marries Talia, achieving happiness and wealth.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Rory to achieve his goals.
