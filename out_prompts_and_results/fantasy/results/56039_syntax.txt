To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her current situation and the available actions. Talia is already married to Rory, which contributes to her happiness. She has also taken the money from Vince, which increases her wealth. The only thing left for Talia to do is to acquire the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia will travel to the cave to acquire the treasure. This action is necessary because the treasure is not in the village, and Talia needs to go to the cave to get it.

2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Once Talia arrives at the cave, she will pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Talia to increase her wealth, as the treasure is the item that will make her wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have both the money and the treasure, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy. She is already happy due to her marriage to Rory.
