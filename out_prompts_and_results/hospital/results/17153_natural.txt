**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young again and confirms that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 2.
