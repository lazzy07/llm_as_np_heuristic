To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take the money without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest to find Bambi. He will then eat Bambi, which fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead. This action is included to ensure that both conditions of the ending are met.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to move from the bank to the forest where Bambi is located. 

The final sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk and that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the bank clerk and take the money, which is his primary goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to travel to the location where Bambi is, enabling him to fulfill the second part of the ending.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
