**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, the Bandit, who is currently at the Crossroads, decides to take action to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. She knows that Tom is at the Market and has just purchased medicine, which she believes he is carrying. 

1. **Action: walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**  
   The Bandit walks from the Crossroads to the Market, where she knows Tom is located. This action is necessary for her to confront Tom and attempt to rob him.

2. **Action: rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**  
   Upon arriving at the Market, the Bandit uses her sword to rob Tom, who is unarmed. She takes the coin that Tom has, which helps her achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **Action: take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**  
   After successfully robbing Tom, the Bandit now has the coin in her possession. She then walks back to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in her chest, ensuring that she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is essential for the Bandit to reach Tom, who is the target of her robbery.
- The second action is the robbery itself, which allows the Bandit to gain coins without becoming a criminal in the eyes of the law, as Tom is not armed.
