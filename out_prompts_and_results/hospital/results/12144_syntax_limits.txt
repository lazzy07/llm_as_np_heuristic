In this story, Jones is currently in Patient Room A, and Hathaway is also in Patient Room A with a workload of 3. To ensure Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones correctly. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk that Hathaway may make a mistake. 

To minimize the risk of error and ensure Jones receives the correct treatment, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash), which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to reduce their workload and prepare for the next patient. This action is not directly related to Jones's health but is necessary for the continuity of care in the hospital.
