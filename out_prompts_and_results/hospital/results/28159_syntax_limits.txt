**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, noticing that Ross is in Patient Room A, decides to assess him first. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Given Hathaway's current workload of 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but Hathaway is determined to help Ross.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing, Hathaway believes Ross has Flaze due to the fever symptom (which is a mistake due to the workload). Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the incorrect treatment for Ross's actual condition (Jarkis). Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's demise.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Jones, who has been waiting. 

At this point, Hathaway has done everything possible to help Ross, but due to the workload, a mistake was made. However, Hathaway's goal of wanting all patients to be healthy remains intact, and they will continue to work towards that goal with Jones.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and is the first step in providing treatment.
- **Treat Ross**: Although Hathaway makes a mistake due to the high workload, this action is crucial as it reflects Hathaway's intent to treat and help the patient.
- **Walk to Admissions**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to continue their work and assess Jones, showing their commitment to patient care.
