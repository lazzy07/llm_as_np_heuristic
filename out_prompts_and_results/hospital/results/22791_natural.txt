**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, noticing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. Since Jones is in Patient Room A, Hathaway administers antibiotics to him. This treatment is successful, and Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Ross is also in Patient Room A but is experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now 1 (after treating Jones), he can still assess Ross without making a mistake. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a rash, indicating that he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, which successfully makes him healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Young, who is still waiting. He assigns Young to Patient Room C. However, since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot treat him yet. But by admitting Young, Hathaway ensures that he will be able to assess and treat him in the future.

At this point, both Jones and Ross are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: This is necessary because Jones has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Treating him successfully makes him healthy.
2. **Assess Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because Ross's symptoms are unknown, and Hathaway needs to identify them to provide the correct treatment.
3. **Treat Ross with steroids**: Once Hathaway discovers that Ross has a rash (indicating Jarkis), he treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.
4. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Although Young's symptoms are unknown, admitting him ensures that he will be treated in the future, contributing to Hathaway's overall goal of having all patients healthy.
