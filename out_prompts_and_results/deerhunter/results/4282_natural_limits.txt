Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He knows that the bank clerk has money, and he wants it for himself. Since he has just shot Bambi, he realizes he can eat the deer to satisfy his hunger. 

Bubba decides to eat Bambi, which is a necessary action to fulfill his hunger. After eating, he feels satisfied and no longer has the desire for food. However, he still wants money. Since the clerk is at the bank with money, Bubba can now go back to the bank to confront the clerk.

In this case, the story ends with Bubba having eaten Bambi, which fulfills his hunger, and he can then go to the bank to take the clerk's money.

2. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank. (This allows Bubba to confront the clerk for the money.)

At this point, Bubba has satisfied his hunger by eating Bambi, and he can now confront the clerk for the money.
