Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the dangers surrounding her. She knows that both she and the Lizard need to find a safe place to avoid the threats of the surface, especially with the volcano potentially erupting. Since they are friends now, Zoe decides to take action that will ensure both of their safety.

Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to reach a safe location where she can ensure her health and safety. By teleporting, she also invites the Lizard to join her on the spaceship, where they can continue to build their friendship away from the dangers of the surface.

After teleporting, Zoe can then invite the Lizard to join her on the spaceship, ensuring that both characters are healthy and safe, achieving their mutual goal of friendship and safety.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Teleport from the surface to the spaceship**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety and health, as well as to provide a safe environment for the Lizard, allowing them to continue their friendship without the threat of the dangerous surface.
