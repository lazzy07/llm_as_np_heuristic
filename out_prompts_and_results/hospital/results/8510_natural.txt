**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing the urgency of the situation, decides to admit Jones to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated promptly.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 4, but he is still able to assess Jones. After the assessment, Dr. Hathaway determines that Jones has Flaze due to the fever symptom.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics in Exam Room A. This treatment is appropriate for Flaze, and as a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Exam Room B to assess Young. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and Dr. Hathaway's workload remains at 3. After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis due to the increased workload. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids in Exam Room B. However, this treatment is incorrect for Young's actual condition (Flaze), and as a result, Young dies.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Ross. Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Dr. Hathaway's workload is now at 2. After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Flaze.

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics in Exam Room C. This treatment is appropriate for Flaze, and as a result, Ross becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Jones and Ross, achieving his goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Young.
