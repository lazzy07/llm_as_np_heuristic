To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the story can be completed with the following action:

1. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money from Vince. This action is necessary because Rory needs to acquire wealth to fulfill their goal of being wealthy. Since Rory is currently in the Village and Vince has the money, this action allows Rory to achieve their goal of wealth.

After this action, Rory will have the money, which contributes to their wealth, and since they are not hungry, they will also be happy due to the fulfillment of their goals.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: This action allows Rory to gain the money that Vince possesses. By acquiring this money, Rory achieves their goal of being wealthy. Since Rory is already in a relationship with Talia (who has accepted his proposal), this also contributes to Rory's happiness.
