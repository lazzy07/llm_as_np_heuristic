To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to go to the bank to get money. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will shoot the bank clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
