Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, decides to take action in the bank. He has already loaded his rifle with ammunition, making him a threat. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk, who is unaware of the danger. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the only obstacle between him and the money in the bank. 

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential: the first removes the threat, and the second secures the desired item.
