Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the ongoing eruptions. To ensure their safety and health, they decide to move to a safer location. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe environment where she can ensure her health and safety. 

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The cave is a safer location for the Lizard, allowing it to avoid the dangers of the erupting surface while remaining healthy and safe.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** - Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both of them are safe. By teleporting to the cave, she can join the Lizard in a safe space.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they both feel secure in their new environment.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
