To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the medicine he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to confront Tom directly and take an item from him, which is a step towards achieving her goal of having more items.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to store the medicine and any coins she may have taken. This action is essential for securing her loot and ensuring she has a safe place to keep her items.

3. **Take Coins from the Chest**: Once at the Bandit Camp, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs Tom to take the medicine.
2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp.
3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This action secures the Bandit's position and allows her to store her items safely.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of acquiring coins, which is the primary objective.
