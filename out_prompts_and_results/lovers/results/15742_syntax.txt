To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (the flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22). This is necessary because Blake is currently holding the flowers, and Casey wants to help Alex.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This is the final action that allows Alex to receive the item they want, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
