Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable, so she decides to treat Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This action is risky, but it is necessary to attempt to help Jones.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing her workload to 2. She then assesses Ross to check for symptoms. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify his condition either. However, she treats Ross with steroids, mistakenly thinking he might have Jarkis.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. She assesses Young, who is also experiencing Unknown, and treats him with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze.

In this sequence, Dr. Hathaway's actions are aimed at treating all patients, even though she makes mistakes due to the unknown symptoms. The goal of ensuring all patients are treated is achieved, even if not all treatments are correct.
