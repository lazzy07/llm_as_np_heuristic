To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the bank with the bank clerk, who has money. Bubba is hungry, but his primary goal is to satisfy his greed by obtaining money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money from the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger after the stressful encounter at the bank.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba needs money, and the clerk has it. Using the rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.
- **go**: Bubba needs to get to a safe place after committing the theft.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba is hungry and needs to address this need.
- **eat**: Consuming Bambi will satisfy Bubba's hunger.
