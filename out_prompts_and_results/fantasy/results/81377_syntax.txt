To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is in the Cave, and she has accepted Vince's proposal, but Vince is dead. She also knows that there is treasure in the Cave, which can help her achieve her goal of wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness or wealth:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary because acquiring the treasure will increase her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **get_hungry(Talia)**: Talia becomes hungry. This action is included to create a scenario where Talia's hunger can be addressed later, which may lead to her happiness.

3. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the Village. This is necessary for her to interact with Rory and potentially improve her situation.

4. **propose(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia proposes to Rory. This action is taken because Talia wants to be happy, and marrying Rory could fulfill that desire.

5. **accept(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory accepts Talia's proposal. This is crucial as it leads to both characters being happy.

6. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This finalizes their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

By following these actions, Talia will achieve happiness through marriage with Rory, and she will also have the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **pickup**: Acquiring the treasure is essential for Talia to become wealthy.
- **get_hungry**: This action sets up a scenario where Talia's needs can be addressed, potentially leading to her happiness.

- **propose**: Talia's proposal to Rory is a direct step towards achieving her happiness.
