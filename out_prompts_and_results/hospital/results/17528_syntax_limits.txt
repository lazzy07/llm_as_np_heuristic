To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. If Ross has Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
