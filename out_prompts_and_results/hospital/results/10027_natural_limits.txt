Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, as Patient Room B is unassigned and can be used for assessment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to assign Jones to an exam room so that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat him.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which will allow Dr. Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.)
