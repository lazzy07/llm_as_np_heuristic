To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will loot the coins from Tom's corpse. This action is necessary because Tom is dead, and the Bandit can take the coins he was carrying, which will help the Bandit achieve her goal of having more coins.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully loots Tom's coins and then retrieves the coins from the chest, ensuring she has achieved her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
