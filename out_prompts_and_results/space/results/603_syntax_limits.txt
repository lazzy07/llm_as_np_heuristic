Zoe, determined to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both their safety, decides to approach the cave where the Lizard resides. She walks from the surface to the cave, where she hopes to communicate and build a friendship.

**Action:**
- walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)

**Explanation:**
Zoe walks to the cave to meet the Lizard. This action is essential because it allows her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends. By choosing to walk instead of teleporting, she avoids angering the Lizard, which could lead to conflict and hinder her goal of friendship.

Once Zoe arrives at the cave, she greets the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goals of health and safety. The Lizard, seeing Zoe's peaceful intentions, agrees to be friends.
