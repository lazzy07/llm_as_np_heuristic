In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where she has just attacked Tom and the Merchant. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coin from Tom's corpse and place it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without risking further confrontation, as Tom is already dead.

This single action fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of the Action:
