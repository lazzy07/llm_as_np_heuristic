To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates in the dining room. This action is necessary because Casey wants to trade the chocolates for the jewelry.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the chocolates to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Alex. This is necessary because Alex needs to receive an item to be happy.

5. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry for the chocolates with Casey. This is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy.

6. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Blake. This is necessary because Blake wants to be happy, and Alex wants Blake to be happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which is what they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
