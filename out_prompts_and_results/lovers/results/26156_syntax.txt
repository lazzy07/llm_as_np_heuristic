To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not yet in anyone's possession, and we need to facilitate the exchange of items to achieve this.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room. This is essential for Casey to have the item they want to eventually give to Blake.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

5. **happy(C2) = True**: After receiving the jewelry, Blake is now happy.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Moving Casey to the dining room** is necessary to access the jewelry.
- **Picking up the jewelry** is essential for Casey to have it in their possession to give it to Blake.
- **Moving back to the living room** allows Casey to be with Blake to complete the exchange.
- **Giving the jewelry to Blake** is the final action that fulfills Blake's desire, making them happy.
