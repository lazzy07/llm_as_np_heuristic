To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21) to be with Alex and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to create a sense of togetherness among the characters.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake to receive the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: While this does not directly affect Alex's happiness, it allows for a more cohesive ending where all characters are together.
