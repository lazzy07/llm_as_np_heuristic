To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also present and has no money. Bubba's greed is high, and he is motivated to get money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any threat and take the money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only other character in the bank, and Bubba needs to ensure he can take the money without resistance.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance, which is important for his survival.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can now focus on his greed and decide to take the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill his goal of acquiring money.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank clerk. This action completes his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Eliminates the threat from the clerk and allows Bubba to take the money without resistance.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, ensuring he remains alive and healthy.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Reinforces Bubba's motivation to acquire money after dealing with the clerk.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
