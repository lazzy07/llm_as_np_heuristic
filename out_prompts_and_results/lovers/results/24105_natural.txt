To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey picks up the jewelry in the bathroom.** (Casey wants the jewelry and is currently in the bathroom where the jewelry is located.)
2. **Casey moves from the bathroom to the living room.** (Casey wants to be happy and is moving to a location where the flowers are.)
3. **Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the living room.** (Casey is now in the living room and can give the jewelry to Alex, which will make Casey happy.)
4. **Alex picks up the flowers in the living room.** (Now that Alex has the jewelry, they can pick up the flowers, which is what they want.)

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry, and Blake will still be unhappy because they have not yet obtained the chocolates. However, the goal is to ensure Alex achieves their happiness.
