Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Dr. Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that they have Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Since Ross is also a patient who needs care, admitting him will allow Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat him in the next step.

This sequence of actions ensures that Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of making patients healthy by treating Young successfully and preparing to treat Ross.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and determine the correct treatment. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is high, assessing only one patient minimizes the risk of error.
2. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's condition (Flaze) and leads to Young's recovery.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: This action is necessary to admit Ross, ensuring that he can be assessed and treated in the next steps.
