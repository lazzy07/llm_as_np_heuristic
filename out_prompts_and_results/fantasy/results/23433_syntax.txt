To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the same location (Cave) and is a viable target. This action will eliminate Rory, allowing Gargax to consume him and satisfy their hunger.

2. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action will provide Gargax with wealth, fulfilling their goal of being wealthy.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Rory, who is also in the Cave. This action satisfies Gargax's hunger.
- After consuming Rory, Gargax takes the treasure that Rory had, thus achieving their goal of wealth.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Gargax to achieve their goals of being wealthy and not hungry.
