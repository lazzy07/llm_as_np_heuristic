To achieve the goal of the Secret Agent, who wants the Mastermind to be dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The Secret Agent moves to the Office to confront the Mastermind. This is necessary because the Mastermind is believed to be at Headquarters, but the Secret Agent needs to be in a position to kill the Mastermind when they arrive.

2. **move(Mastermind, Headquarters, Lobby)**: The Mastermind moves to the Lobby, believing the Secret Agent is still at Headquarters. This action is necessary for the Mastermind to be in the same location as the Secret Agent for the confrontation.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves to the Lobby to meet the Mastermind. This is essential for the Secret Agent to be in the same location as the Mastermind to carry out the next action.

4. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent uses the Gun to kill the Mastermind in the Lobby. This is the final action that achieves the Secret Agent's goal of eliminating the Mastermind.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Secret Agent successfully confronts and kills the Mastermind, fulfilling their objective.
