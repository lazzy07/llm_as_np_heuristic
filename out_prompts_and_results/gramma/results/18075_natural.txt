To achieve the goal of having Tom at the cottage with the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach the market where the merchant is located, as he needs to acquire the medicine.

2. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, Tom can gain the guard's assistance. The guard will then focus on dealing with the bandit, allowing Tom to safely acquire the medicine.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard moves to the crossroads to confront the bandit, ensuring that Tom can proceed without fear of being attacked.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit moves to the market, likely to escape the guard or to find a new target, which creates an opportunity for Tom.

5. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - With the bandit distracted and the guard at the crossroads, Tom can safely return to the cottage.

6. **Tom takes the medicine from the merchant.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Tom to finally obtain the medicine he desires.

7. **Tom walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom returns to the cottage with the medicine.

The sequence of actions ensures that Tom can safely navigate the situation, avoid confrontation with the bandit, and ultimately achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
