To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom at the crossroads to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp to store the coins in the chest. This action is essential for the bandit to secure her stolen coins.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit successfully robs Tom, taking the coin he is carrying. This action is crucial for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit walks to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the coins in the chest. This action ensures that the bandit can secure her ill-gotten gains.

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying more coins.
