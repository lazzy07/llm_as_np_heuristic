To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and needs to go to the Market to confront Tom and the Merchant. This action is necessary to reach the location where she can interact with them.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying coins. This action allows the Bandit to take the coins from Tom, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to return to a location where she can decide her next move.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she has just acquired from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest.
