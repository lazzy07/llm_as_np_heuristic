To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to leave the bathroom to find the chocolates, which he wants. This action is necessary for Blake to pursue his own happiness.

2. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - Blake believes the flowers are with Casey, but they are actually in the living room. He picks them up to potentially give them to Alex later.

   - Blake returns to the bathroom to be with Alex and to discuss the items they have.

4. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the bathroom.**
