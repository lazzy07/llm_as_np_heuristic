Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, he decides to take a risk. He crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he finds the bully and, with the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen, he kills the bully. With the threat eliminated, Ernest can now safely escape the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Crawl through the vents to the gym**: This action allows Ernest to confront the bully without being seen, as he is currently threatened.
2. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This action eliminates the immediate threat to both Ernest and Roy, allowing Ernest to feel safe and secure.
