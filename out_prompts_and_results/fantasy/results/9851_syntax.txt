To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she currently has no wealth.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, this action will make both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village. This action is not strictly necessary for Talia's goals but helps to establish a narrative closure.

4. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village. This action is also not strictly necessary for Talia's goals but helps to conclude the story.

6. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax travels back to the village. This action is included for narrative completeness, showing that the dragon also leaves the cave.

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, making her wealthy, and she will be happy due to her marriage to Vince.
