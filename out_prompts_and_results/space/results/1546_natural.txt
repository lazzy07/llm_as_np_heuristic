Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to take action to ensure both her and the Lizard's safety. She knows that the Lizard is currently at the surface and is in danger. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help him, as she believes he is not safe. 

2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** - This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring they can communicate effectively about the danger.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action solidifies their bond and emphasizes their mutual goal of safety.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. 

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to escape the erupting volcano, ensuring both characters survive.

In this sequence, the volcano erupts, but both Zoe and the Lizard manage to escape to the spaceship, thus avoiding death. They also reinforce their friendship through their actions.
