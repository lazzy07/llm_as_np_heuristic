The bandit, having just attacked the hero, sees the merchant at the crossroads. The bandit decides to rob the merchant, who is not armed. The bandit approaches the merchant and, with her sword drawn, demands the medicine. The merchant, unable to defend herself, hands over the medicine to the bandit. 

Now, the bandit has successfully acquired the medicine and can return to the bandit camp, where she can store her loot, including the coins in the chest. This action fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Rob the Merchant**: The bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring valuable items.
2. **Return to Bandit Camp**: Although not explicitly stated in the actions, the bandit would then return to the bandit camp to store her loot, which is implied as part of her goal.
