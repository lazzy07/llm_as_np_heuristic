Bubba is in the forest, having just shot Bambi. He is hungry and wants to have money. Since he has the rifle and the ammunition loaded, he decides to go to the bank to get money from the clerk.

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to reach the bank to get the money he desires.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the clerk's money.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can now eat Bambi, which is dead.)

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money and has also satisfied his hunger.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** is necessary for Bubba to access the money he wants.
- **Stealing the money** is the quickest way for Bubba to achieve his goal of having money since he has the means (the loaded rifle) to do so.
- **Deciding to eat** allows Bubba to address his hunger after having successfully stolen the money.
