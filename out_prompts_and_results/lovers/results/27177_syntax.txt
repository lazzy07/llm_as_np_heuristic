To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be out of the way to allow Alex to pick up the jewelry.

2. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) after Casey. This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as the jewelry.

3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) in the dining room (R21). This is the key action that allows Alex to achieve their goal of being happy.

4. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake after picking up the jewelry.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to check on Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamic.

6. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This keeps the group together.

At this point, Alex has the jewelry, which makes them happy. The other characters' actions are primarily to maintain the social dynamic and do not interfere with Alex's goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "move(C2, R21, R22)"

```
