To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC with Jones, the first action is to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway needs to walk to PatientRoomA to assess Ross. This is important to ensure that Ross is also treated appropriately based on their symptoms.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is currently in Admissions. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This is necessary for Ross to also become healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is essential to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Treating patients**: This is the final step to ensure that each patient receives the correct treatment, which is necessary for them to become healthy.
