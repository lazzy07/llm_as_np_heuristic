To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are now engaged, and she already possesses the treasure. The key actions will involve Talia and Rory getting married, which will increase their happiness, and Talia will also need to acquire money to fulfill her desire for wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave to join Talia and Rory. This is necessary because Talia needs to interact with Vince to acquire the money he has.

2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of wealth.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action fulfills Talia's goal of happiness, as marriage will make both characters happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince needs to be present in the cave for Talia to take the money from him.
2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia needs to acquire money to achieve her goal of being wealthy.
3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action ensures Talia's happiness through marriage with Rory.

After these actions, Talia will have both happiness (from marrying Rory) and wealth (from acquiring the money).
