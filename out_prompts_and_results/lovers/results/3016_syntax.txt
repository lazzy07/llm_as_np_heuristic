To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the characters' desires. The goal is to have Blake end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3).

### Story Completion:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R21). This action is necessary for Casey to be in a position to interact with the items in the bathroom.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R21). This allows Alex to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating communication and potential item exchange.

3. **tell(C3, C2, I3, R21)**: Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the jewelry (I3). This is a strategic move to mislead Casey into thinking that Blake desires the jewelry, which is actually what Blake wants.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) after hearing Alex's statement. This action is necessary for Casey to retrieve the jewelry.

5. **pick_up(C2, I3, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from the dining room (R22). This is essential for Casey to have the item that Blake supposedly wants.

6. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the bathroom (R21) to give the jewelry to Blake.

7. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake. This action fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two moves position Casey and Alex in the same room, allowing for communication.
- The tell action is a strategic lie that sets up the next actions, leading Casey to believe that Blake wants the jewelry.
- The subsequent moves and pick-up actions allow Casey to retrieve the jewelry, which is crucial for the final give action.
- The final give action is the culmination of the plan, ensuring Blake receives the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
