In the dining room, Alex holds the flowers and is happy. Blake, who is not happy, wants the chocolates, and Casey, also not happy, wants the jewelry. To help Alex achieve their goal of happiness, Blake can take an action that leads to a resolution.

Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which will make Blake happy. Since Alex is already happy with the flowers, this action does not affect Alex's happiness but ensures that Blake's goal is also met.

- Alex is in the dining room with the flowers and is happy.
- Blake is in the dining room with the chocolates and is happy.
- Casey is still in the dining room with the jewelry and is not happy.

**Explanation of the actions:**
1. **Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room.** - This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of happiness, while Alex remains happy with the flowers.
