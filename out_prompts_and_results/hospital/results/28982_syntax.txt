To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where they can be assessed and treated. Since Hathaway is currently in Patient Room C, they can admit Young from the admissions room.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: After admitting Young, Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (which is likely since we have not established any symptoms yet), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to confirm his symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

5. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (which is possible since he has SymptomA), Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics, ensuring he becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal.
