To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not currently held by any character, and we need to facilitate a series of actions that will lead to Blake obtaining I2.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Blake moves to the dining room (R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to access the item I2, which is believed to be in the dining room according to the current beliefs of the characters.
   - Action: `move(C3, R22, R12)`

2. **Blake picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room (R12)**: This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.
   - Action: `pick_up(C3, I2, R12)`

3. **Blake moves to the living room (R22)**: This action is to ensure that Blake can be in a room where they can interact with the other characters if needed.
   - Action: `move(C3, R12, R22)`

4. **Blake tells Alex that they have the jewelry (I2) in the living room (R22)**: This action is to inform Alex about Blake's happiness, which is part of Blake's goal of wanting Alex to be happy as well.
   - Action: `tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)`

5. **Blake gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22)**: This action is to ensure that Alex is happy, as they want I3 (the chocolates) and Blake is willing to help Alex achieve their happiness.
   - Action: `give(C3, I2, C1, R22)`

Now, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2), and they have also helped Alex by giving them the item they want.
