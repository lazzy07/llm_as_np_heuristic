In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the item I1 (flowers) to be happy. Casey (C3) is in the same room as Alex and has the flowers. Blake (C2) is in a different room and has chocolates (I2) that Casey wants. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R12)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) they have with Alex for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Casey will be happy if they wanted the jewelry, which is not specified but can be assumed for the sake of the story.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the most efficient way for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness since it directly results in Alex obtaining the item they desire.
