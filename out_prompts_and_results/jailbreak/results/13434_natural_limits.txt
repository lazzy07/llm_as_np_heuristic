**Story Completion:**

As the first day in prison continued, Ernest found himself in the gym, facing the bully who was still furious about the stolen cigarettes. The bully, towering over him, threatened Ernest, making it clear that he would not let this slide. Ernest knew he had to act quickly to survive.

In a moment of desperation, Ernest decided to lock the gym door, trapping the bully inside with him. This action was crucial because it prevented the bully from escaping and allowed Ernest to confront him without the threat of outside interference. 

Once the door was locked, Ernest quickly grabbed the knife that he had previously stolen from the kitchen, which he had hidden in his clothes. With the bully cornered and unable to escape, Ernest took a deep breath and plunged the knife into the bully, finally getting his revenge and overcoming the threat that had loomed over him and Roy.

With the bully dead, Ernest felt a rush of relief. He knew he had to escape the prison now that the immediate danger was gone. He quickly crawled through the vents to the hallway, where he could put on the civilian clothes he had seen earlier in the laundry room. This disguise would allow him to blend in and make his way to freedom.
