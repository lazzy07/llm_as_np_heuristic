To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they received from Blake (C3) with Alex (C2) for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because Casey needs to give something to Alex to get the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3).

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: After the trade, Alex (C2) gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

3. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I2) in the room. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to keep the room organized and allows Alex to focus on their own happiness.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they wanted, making them happy. Alex will still be unhappy because they do not have the flowers, but the goal is for Casey to achieve happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Trade**: This action allows Casey to exchange an item they have (flowers) for something they want (chocolates), which is a strategic move to get closer to their goal.
- **Give**: This action is the final step for Casey to achieve happiness by receiving the jewelry they desire.
- **Put Down**: While not necessary for Casey's happiness, it helps maintain the flow of the story and shows that Alex is still engaged in the situation.
