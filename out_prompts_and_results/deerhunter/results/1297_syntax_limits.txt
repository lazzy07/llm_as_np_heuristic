To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow a concise sequence of actions. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares him to either threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi, depending on his next move.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions of the story.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba decides to get money. Since he is now free to act without concern for Bambi, he can focus on his greed and the money he desires.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money (by deciding to get it after eliminating a potential threat) and also results in Bambi being dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action is essential for Bubba to be able to shoot and kill Bambi, as he needs a loaded gun to do so.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, which is one of the two possible endings.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action allows Bubba to pursue his goal of acquiring money, which he has been greedy for throughout the story.
