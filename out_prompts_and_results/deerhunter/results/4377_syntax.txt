To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, having a loaded rifle, can steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and he has the means to intimidate the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary to remove him from the scene of the crime and to secure his position with the stolen money.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is already satisfied as Bubba is greedy and has stolen the money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully stolen the money from the clerk, and Bambi is confirmed dead from the previous actions. The story ends with Bubba having the money.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **steal**: This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
- **go**: This action helps Bubba to escape the bank after committing the theft, ensuring he is not caught.
- **decide_to_get_money**: This action is already satisfied, confirming Bubba's motivation aligns with his actions.
