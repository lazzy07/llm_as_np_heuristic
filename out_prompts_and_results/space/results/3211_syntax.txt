To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial for both characters to feel safe and to establish a bond, which is essential for the Lizard's goal of making friends.

2. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: After making peace, Zoe can teleport to the spaceship. This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt.

3. **Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard will walk to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface. This action helps the Lizard to avoid the danger posed by the erupting volcano.

4. **Lizard waits in the cave**: The Lizard will remain in the cave until the eruption is over. This action ensures that the Lizard stays safe and healthy while waiting for the danger to pass.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety and friendship.
