To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market, where she can potentially find more coins or interact with the Merchant.
2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads, maintaining her presence near Tom and the Merchant.
3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom moves to the Market, where he can interact with the Merchant and potentially buy more items.
4. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves to the Crossroads to meet Tom and the Bandit.
5. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom returns to the Crossroads, where he can interact with the Merchant and the Bandit.
6. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: Tom buys the medicine from the Merchant, giving her a coin. This action helps the Merchant achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.
7. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Merchant moves back to the Camp, where she can store her coins safely.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Banditâ€™s movements are primarily to keep the tension and potential for conflict alive, but she does not directly interfere with the Merchant's goal.
- Tom's actions are crucial as he buys the medicine from the Merchant, which directly contributes to her goal of acquiring coins.
- The Merchant's final move to the Camp ensures that she is away from any potential conflict and can keep her coins safe.
