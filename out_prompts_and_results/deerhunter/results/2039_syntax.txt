   - **Explanation**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat after stealing the money.
   - **Explanation**: This action reflects Bubba's hunger and his need to satisfy it after the confrontation.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, who is now dead.
