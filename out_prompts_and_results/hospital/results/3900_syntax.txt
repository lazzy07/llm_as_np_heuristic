To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway is currently in Patient Room A and has a workload of 2, they can assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can then assess Young in Exam Room C. This will help determine Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Similarly, after assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment to ensure he also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat both patients, ensuring they are healthy.
