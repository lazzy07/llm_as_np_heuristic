To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions to acquire the treasure and increase her wealth. Here’s the completed story:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** (Rory wants to be happy and wealthy, but he is currently at the cave where Gargax is. He needs to leave the cave to avoid danger and find a way to help Talia.)
   
2. **Gargax eats Rory.** (This action is necessary to show that Rory is no longer a threat to Talia's happiness and wealth, as he is now out of the picture.)

3. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** (Vince wants to help Talia and is unaware of Rory's fate. He travels to the cave to potentially assist Talia in acquiring the treasure.)

4. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.** (Vince picks up the treasure to help Talia achieve her goal of wealth.)

5. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (Vince returns to the village with the treasure to give it to Talia.)

6. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.** (This action is implied as Vince is now in the village with Talia, and he can give her the treasure.)

7. **Talia's wealth increases.** (With the treasure now in her possession, Talia achieves her goal of being wealthy.)

8. **Talia's happiness increases.** (Talia is now happy because she has achieved her goal of wealth.)

In this story, Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy through the actions of Vince, who acquires the treasure and brings it to her. Rory's fate is sealed by Gargax, ensuring that Talia's happiness is not compromised by any potential rivalry.
