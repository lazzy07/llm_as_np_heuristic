To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a position to interact with the hero and the guard, as she needs to sell items to them to gain coins.

2. **The merchant sees the hero at the crossroads and offers to sell the medicine back to him for the hero's coin.**  
   - The merchant needs to sell the medicine to the hero to gain a coin. The hero has the medicine, and the merchant believes he has a coin.

3. **The hero buys the medicine from the merchant using the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain a coin, fulfilling her goal of acquiring coins without committing a crime.

4. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant moves to the market to continue her business and potentially sell more items to other characters.

At this point, the merchant has successfully acquired a coin from the hero without engaging in any criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
