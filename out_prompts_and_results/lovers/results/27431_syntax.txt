To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I3) they have for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C2) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want directly from Casey.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making Alex happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I3), which is not what they want, but since Alex is now happy, the goal is achieved.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, fulfilling their goal of happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
