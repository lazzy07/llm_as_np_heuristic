To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already in the bank and has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the bank clerk into giving him the money. The actions will be as follows:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and demand the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the money from the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his position and avoid any potential consequences from the bank clerk.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling his goal of acquiring money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action allows Bubba to escape from the bank after successfully stealing the money, ensuring he is not caught.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
