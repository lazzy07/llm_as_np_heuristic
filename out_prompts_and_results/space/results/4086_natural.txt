Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface of the planet, both aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and they know they need to act quickly to ensure their safety.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous. By teleporting, she can avoid the imminent threat of the volcano erupting.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** The Lizard needs to find a safe place away from the surface, where it can remain healthy and safe. The cave provides a refuge from the dangers of the surface.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action is crucial for Zoe to maintain her friendship with the Lizard and to ensure they can work together to stay safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they were already friends, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures they can collaborate effectively to face any future challenges.

5. **The Lizard and Zoe decide to stay in the cave until the danger passes.** This action is implied as they both recognize the need to remain safe and healthy, away from the erupting volcano.

Through these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also maintaining their friendship.
