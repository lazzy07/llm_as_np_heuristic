To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Casey wants jewelry (I3), and currently, they are not happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
