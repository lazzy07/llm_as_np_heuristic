To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit has already robbed the Merchant of Tom's coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to go to the chest at the camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk to the Crossroads to position herself for the next action.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins without being caught or killed by the Guard or Tom.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **rob**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire a coin from the Merchant, which is part of her goal to have coins.
- **walk**: The Bandit needs to move to the Crossroads and then to the Bandit Camp to secure her coins. These movements are necessary to reach her destination.
- **take**: This action ensures that the Bandit successfully collects the coins from the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins.
