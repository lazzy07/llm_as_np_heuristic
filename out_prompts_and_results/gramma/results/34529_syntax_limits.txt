To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to take the following action:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the Crossroads to the Cottage. This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to be at the Cottage, and the only way to get there from the Crossroads is to walk.

This single action allows Tom to successfully reach his desired location with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it directly leads Tom to his goal of being at the Cottage. Since he is already at the Crossroads and the path to the Cottage is available, this is the most efficient action to take.
