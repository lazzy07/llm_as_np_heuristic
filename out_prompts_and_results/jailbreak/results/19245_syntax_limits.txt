**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the gym with the bully. Knowing that the gym door is locked, he feels a surge of confidence with the knife he stole earlier. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, is busy lifting weights. 

Roy decides to take action. He approaches the bully and, in a swift motion, he kills the bully with the knife. With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief and freedom. He quickly checks the area for any guards and, seeing none, he makes his way to the hallway.

Once in the hallway, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. He puts on the civilian clothes he had previously stolen, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he steps out onto the highway, successfully escaping from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: This action is crucial as it removes the threat posed by the bully, allowing Roy to feel safe and secure. It also enables him to proceed with his escape without fear of being threatened.

2. **go(Roy, Hall)**: After eliminating the bully, Roy needs to move to the hallway to access the vents, which is essential for his escape.

3. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: Crawling through the vents allows Roy to bypass any guards and reach the highway safely.

4. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Putting on the civilian clothes is necessary for Roy to blend in and avoid detection as he escapes from the prison.

5. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: This final action is the culmination of Roy's efforts, allowing him to successfully leave the prison and achieve his goal of being alive and free.
