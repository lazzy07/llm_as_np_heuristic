Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface, where it is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to take actions that will allow her to connect with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and establish a connection. Since the Lizard is currently at the surface, this will allow them to meet.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Once Zoe reaches the surface, she can initiate a peaceful interaction with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - After making peace, they can walk back to the cave together. This ensures that they are both safe from the dangers of the erupting surface.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** - By walking together to the cave, they solidify their friendship, achieving Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

This sequence of actions ensures that both Zoe and the Lizard are safe and healthy while also fulfilling Zoe's desire to make friends.
