**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, first assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. Next, Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Jones, who is experiencing a fever. Recognizing the symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. 

After treating Jones, Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Ross again. This time, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the increased workload and treats him with antibiotics. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Ross dies. 

Finally, Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young, who is experiencing a rash. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Jarkis and treats him with steroids, making him healthy.

In the end, Jones and Young are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross.
