To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey is happy with the chocolates (I3), and Alex is not happy because they do not have the jewelry (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Blake.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C3) in the living room (R21). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room (R22) where Alex is located. This is to ensure that all characters are in the same room for the final interaction.

4. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that they have the jewelry (I2) in the dining room (R22). This is important for Alex to understand that Blake is now happy.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
