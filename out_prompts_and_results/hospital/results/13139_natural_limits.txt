Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, first assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Upon observing the rash, Hathaway correctly identifies that Ross has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, which successfully cures him. 

Next, Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Given Hathaway's workload is now 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. Hathaway assesses Jones and discovers he has Flaze due to the fever. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him as well.

Finally, Hathaway walks to Admissions again to assess Young, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 1, Hathaway assesses Young and finds he has Flaze as well. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, ensuring he is healthy too.

By the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
