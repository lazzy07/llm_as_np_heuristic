**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Roy realizes he has the upper hand against the bully. He knows that the bully is a threat to both him and Ernest, and he cannot let that continue. With the knife he stole from the kitchen, Roy decides to take action. He approaches the bully, who is trapped inside the gym with him, and in a moment of desperation and determination, he kills the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief. He knows that he can now safely escape the prison with the civilian clothes he also stole. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself and heads to the hallway. From there, he crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once he reaches the highway, he successfully escapes, finally free from the threats of the prison.
