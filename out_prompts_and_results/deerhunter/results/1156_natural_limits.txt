Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He points the rifle at the bank clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over 1 money to Bubba. Satisfied with his gain, Bubba now has the money he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not included because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and shooting the clerk would not help him achieve that goal. Instead, he uses intimidation to get what he wants.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money. The clerk's fear leads him to comply without further conflict.

The story is short and direct, with only two necessary actions to achieve Bubba's goal.
