Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room B. During the assessment, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis due to the high workload, which leads to a misdiagnosis. However, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross is actually healthy and does not have Jarkis, the treatment does not harm him, and he remains alive and healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to an exam room. Dr. Hathaway assigns Jones to Patient Room A, where he can be assessed later.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to check on Ross again, ensuring he is still healthy.

In this sequence of actions, Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, despite the misdiagnosis.
