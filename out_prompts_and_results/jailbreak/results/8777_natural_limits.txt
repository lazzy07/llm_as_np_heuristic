**Story Completion:**

As the day progressed, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realized he had to act quickly. He took a deep breath, gripped the knife tightly, and decided to confront the bully. 

With a swift motion, Roy lunged at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, who had been so confident in his threats, was unable to react in time. Roy managed to stab the bully, killing him instantly. 

With the bully now out of the way, Roy felt a rush of relief. He quickly searched the bully's pockets and found a set of civilian clothes. He put them on, disguising himself. 

Now, with the gym door locked and the bully dead, Roy crawled through the vent to the hallway. Once in the hallway, he slipped on the civilian clothes to complete his disguise. 

Finally, Roy made his way to the highway outside the prison, where he successfully escaped, leaving the prison behind.
