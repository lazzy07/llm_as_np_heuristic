To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Casey to have an item that can be used for a trade.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary to facilitate the trade.

4. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake for the jewelry (I1). This action is crucial as it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **put_down(C2, I1, R22)**: Blake puts down the jewelry in the living room after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but helps clarify the final state of the items.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is the item they wanted.
