To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat them. Since Young is currently in the admissions room, admitting them will allow Hathaway to manage their care.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because it will inform the treatment decision. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can accurately assess Ross without making a mistake.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms as well. This is important for the same reason as assessing Ross.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for that disease. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for that disease. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat both patients correctly, leading to their recovery.
