Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have just made peace with each other, solidifying their friendship. 

1. **Zoe walks with the Lizard to the cave.** This action is necessary because it allows both characters to find shelter from the erupting volcano, ensuring their safety and health. By moving to the cave, they can avoid the immediate danger of the eruption.

2. **The volcano erupts.** This event is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption, which also emphasizes the importance of their friendship and cooperation.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard celebrate their friendship in the cave.** This action reinforces their bond and ensures that they are both healthy and safe, achieving their goals of making friends and being secure.

In this story, the actions taken are minimal yet effective in achieving the desired outcome of safety, friendship, and the eruption of the volcano.
