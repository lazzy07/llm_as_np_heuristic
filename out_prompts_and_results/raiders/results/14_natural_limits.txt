**Story Completion:**

After the Nazis opened the Ark and died, Indiana Jones realized that the Ark was still at Tanis, unguarded. He quickly decided to take action. 

1. **Indiana Jones travels from Tanis to the USA.** (This action is necessary for Indiana to inform the U.S. Army about the Ark's location and the fate of the Nazis.)
   
2. **Indiana Jones informs the U.S. Army about the Ark.** (This action is implied as part of the travel; he shares crucial information that the Ark is at Tanis and that the Nazis are dead.)

3. **The U.S. Army travels from the USA to Tanis.** (This action is necessary for the U.S. Army to retrieve the Ark now that they know its location and that it is unguarded.)

4. **The U.S. Army digs up the Ark.** (This action is necessary for the U.S. Army to take possession of the Ark, achieving their goal.)
