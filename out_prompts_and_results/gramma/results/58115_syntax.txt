To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently vulnerable since he is unarmed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in her possession, completing her objective.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step to ensure the Bandit gains coins without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed and is an easy target.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is crucial for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her coins.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of carrying coins.
