To complete the story, Bubba needs to go to the bank to steal the money from the clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to achieve his goal of obtaining 1 money. Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.**  
   - Since Bubba wants to obtain the money and has a loaded rifle, shooting the clerk will eliminate the threat and allow Bubba to take the money without resistance.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to interact with him.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk and take the money without any opposition.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money.
