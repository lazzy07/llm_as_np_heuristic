To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that I1 is in the same room (R22) as Alex (C1), Casey (C2), and Blake (C3). However, Alex is not happy yet, which means they do not have the jewelry. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Casey (C2) trades the jewelry (I1) with Blake (C3) for the chocolates (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to give away the jewelry, which is what Alex wants. After this trade, Blake has the jewelry, and Casey has the chocolates.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake (C3) gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which means Alex is happy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **trade(C2, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: This action allows Casey to give away the jewelry, which is what Alex wants. It also ensures that Blake has an item (chocolates) that they may want, keeping them happy as well.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is the final step that directly makes Alex happy by giving them the jewelry they desire. 

By following this plan, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
