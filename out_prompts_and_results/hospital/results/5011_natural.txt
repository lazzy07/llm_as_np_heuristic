**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, after assessing Ross and observing his fever, decides to treat him for Flaze, as that is the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. This action is crucial because it directly addresses Ross's condition, ensuring he becomes healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to zero, allowing him to focus on the other patients. He then walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones and Young, who are still experiencing unknown symptoms. 

In the admissions room, Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B and Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure both patients are assigned to exam rooms where they can be assessed and treated.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones. Since Jones's symptoms are still unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease yet. However, he can treat Jones with antibiotics, as it is a common treatment that will not harm him, even if he does not have Flaze. This action is taken to ensure that Jones has a chance of becoming healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young. Similar to Jones, Young's symptoms are unknown, but Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is a safe option that will not harm him either.

By treating both Jones and Young, Dr. Hathaway ensures that all patients are given a chance to recover, fulfilling his goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy.
