**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, assesses Ross again to confirm his symptoms. Since Ross is showing a rash, Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, which is the appropriate treatment for Jarkis. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. Given Hathaway's workload is now 2, he is still able to make an accurate assessment. Upon assessing Jones, Hathaway discovers that Jones is also showing symptoms of Flaze (fever). Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, and Jones becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions again to assess Young. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but with a workload of 1, Hathaway can accurately assess him. Upon assessment, Hathaway finds that Young is showing symptoms of Flaze as well. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, and Young becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved his goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
