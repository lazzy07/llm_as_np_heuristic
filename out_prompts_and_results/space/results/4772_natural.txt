Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is dangerous due to the potential eruption of the volcano. To ensure their safety and health, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can be safe from the dangers of the surface. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intention, agrees to join her on the spaceship, as they both want to be healthy and safe.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe and healthy. By teleporting to the spaceship, she removes herself from the dangerous environment of the surface.

2. **The Lizard teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is implied as the Lizard follows Zoe to ensure they are both safe and healthy. Since they are friends, the Lizard would want to be with Zoe in a safe environment.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe, while also maintaining their friendship.
