**Story Completion:**

1. **Blake moves from the bedroom to the living room.**  
   *Explanation: Blake needs to leave the bedroom to find Casey and the chocolates. Since Blake believes that Alex is in the living room, they will also be able to interact with Alex.*

2. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are with Alex.**  
   *Explanation: Blake is trying to mislead Casey into thinking that the chocolates are with Alex, which will prompt Casey to move and potentially create an opportunity for Blake to get the chocolates.*

3. **Casey moves from the living room to the bedroom.**  
   *Explanation: Believing Blake's lie, Casey goes to the bedroom to find the chocolates, leaving the living room empty.*

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates from the living room.**  
   *Explanation: With Casey gone, Blake can now take the chocolates, which is what Blake wants to be happy.*

5. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.**  
   *Explanation: By giving the chocolates to Alex, Blake ensures that Alex is happy, which is also part of Blake's goal.*

**Final Situation:**
- Alex is happy because they received the chocolates.
- Blake is happy because they have achieved their goal of making Alex happy.
