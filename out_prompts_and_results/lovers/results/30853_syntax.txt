To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any known location, but we can assume it is in the living room (R22) since it hasn't been picked up or placed down yet. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) to check for the jewelry (I2).
   - This action is necessary for Casey to access the room where the jewelry is believed to be.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room (R22).
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R12) with the jewelry (I2).
   - This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to give them the jewelry.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R12).
   - This action is necessary for Blake to receive the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they will have the jewelry (I2).
