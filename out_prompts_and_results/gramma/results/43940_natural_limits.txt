The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She knows that the guard is present and that the hero is at the crossroads, so she quickly approaches the guard. 

The bandit reports her own location to the guard, claiming that she has seen a criminal nearby (which is herself). This action distracts the guard and allows her to slip away unnoticed. 

With the guard preoccupied, the bandit returns to the bandit camp, where she can safely store the coins she has looted from the merchant. 

In this way, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Report the location of the bandit to the guard**: This action serves to distract the guard, allowing the bandit to escape without being pursued. It creates a diversion that helps her achieve her goal of securing her coins.
