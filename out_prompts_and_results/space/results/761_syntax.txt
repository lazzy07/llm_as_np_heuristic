To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to strengthen their relationship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it solidifies their friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters are still in a safe location, as the surface is currently dangerous due to the volcano.

4. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard follows Zoe back to the surface. This action is important for the Lizard to remain close to Zoe and to ensure they are both together in a safe location.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger of the surface and the importance of their previous actions.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
