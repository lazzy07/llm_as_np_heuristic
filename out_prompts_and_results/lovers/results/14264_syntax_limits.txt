In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (jewelry), which is currently with Casey (C2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Alex needs to obtain the jewelry from Casey. 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade the item I3 (chocolates) they have with Casey (C2) for the item I1 (jewelry) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to get the item they want (jewelry) in exchange for something they have (chocolates), thus making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making them happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which they may or may not want, but it allows Alex to achieve their goal.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to give the chocolates to Casey in exchange for the jewelry. It is the only action needed to ensure Alex's happiness.
