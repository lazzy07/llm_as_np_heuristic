Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action at the bank. He approaches the bank clerk, who has 1 money. Bubba, with the rifle loaded, becomes greedy and decides to steal the money from the clerk. 

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to take the clerk's money, as he has a loaded rifle and the clerk is the only one with money.
2. **Bubba picks up the money**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, which fulfills his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger indirectly by ensuring he has resources for future needs.
