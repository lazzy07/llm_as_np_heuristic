**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, now on the highway, realizes he needs to help Ernest and ensure their safety. He decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room to disguise himself. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized by the guards or the bully.

1. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, making it safer for him to move around without being threatened.)

Now disguised, Roy sneaks back through the vent to the hallway, where he can access the gym without being seen.

2. **Roy sneaks through the vent to the hallway.** (This keeps him hidden from the bully and allows him to approach the gym.)

Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping and to protect Ernest.

3. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action secures the bully inside, giving Roy and Ernest a chance to confront him safely.)

Meanwhile, Ernest, still in the kitchen with the cigarettes, realizes he needs to defend himself. He quickly grabs the knife, which is essential for his safety against the bully.

4. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This gives him a means of defense against the bully.)

With the knife in hand, Ernest moves to the hallway to join Roy.

5. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This allows him to reunite with Roy and prepare to confront the bully together.)

Now that both are in the hallway, they can confront the bully. Roy and Ernest decide to take action against the bully to ensure their survival.

6. **Ernest and Roy confront the bully in the gym.** (This is the moment they take control of the situation.)

With the bully trapped inside the gym, Ernest uses the knife to defend himself and Roy.

7. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This eliminates the threat to both characters, allowing them to feel safe.)

With the bully gone, they can now escape. Roy and Ernest head back to the highway, where they can finally leave the prison.

8. **Roy and Ernest put on civilian clothes.** (This disguises them for their escape.)

9. **Roy and Ernest escape from the prison.** (This fulfills their goal of being alive and free.)
