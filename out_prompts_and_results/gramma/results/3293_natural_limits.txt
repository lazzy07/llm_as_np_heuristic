Tom, having just purchased the medicine from the merchant, realizes that the merchant is now dead. He knows he must leave the market quickly to avoid any trouble with the bandit or the guard. Tom decides to walk from the market to the crossroads, where he can then head back to the cottage with the medicine.

1. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.** (This action is necessary for Tom to leave the dangerous situation at the market and move towards his goal of reaching the cottage.)
2. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.** (This action allows Tom to finally reach his destination, the cottage, carrying the medicine.)

With these two actions, Tom successfully achieves his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
