Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are aware of the dangerous status of the surface, but they are healthy and safe for now. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, and the Lizard shares the same desire.

To solidify their friendship and ensure their safety, Zoe decides to take action. She suggests they explore the cave together, where they can find shelter and learn more about each other. 

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks from the surface to the cave. This action is necessary for both characters to move to a safer location away from the dangers of the surface, allowing them to bond further.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their friendship as they are now in the same location, away from the dangers of the surface.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once inside the cave, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship. This action ensures that both characters achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

By the end of these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard are safe in the cave, having successfully formed a friendship.
