**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to admit Jones to an exam room. She assigns Jones to Exam Room A, which is currently unoccupied.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A. She discovers that Jones is experiencing symptoms of Flaze, as he has a fever. Since she has a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she correctly identifies the disease.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, the appropriate treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2. She then walks to Exam Room B to assess Young. Upon assessment, she finds that Young is also experiencing symptoms of Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, and Young becomes healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Ross. She finds that Ross is experiencing symptoms of Jarkis, as he has a rash. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Ross becomes healthy.

With all patients treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
