To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Blake wants.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Blake is. This allows Casey to give the chocolates to Blake.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates.
- Casey will be happy because they have helped Blake achieve happiness.
- Alex will remain unhappy, but since the goal is to make Blake happy, this is acceptable.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the dining room to access the chocolates.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the chocolates, which Blake wants.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey must return to the living room to give the chocolates to Blake.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: This action directly satisfies Blake's desire, making them happy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:
