To achieve Bubba's goal of having 0 money, he needs to ensure that he does not acquire any money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already at the bank and the clerk has 1 money, he can take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to hand over the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 0 money, as he needs to prevent the clerk from keeping the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba acquiring the clerk's money, which he does not want. However, since his goal is to have 0 money, he will need to take further action to resolve this.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: Bubba will go to the forest where Bambi is located. This is necessary because he needs to find a way to get rid of the money he just stole.

4. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: Since Bambi is alive, Bubba can shoot Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to eat and satisfy his hunger, while also allowing him to dispose of the money he stole.

5. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi**: This action allows Bubba to eat Bambi, which fulfills his hunger. After eating, he will have no money left, as he will have consumed the deer.

6. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This final action ensures that Bubba is no longer hungry and has achieved his goal of having 0 money, as he will not have any money left after the events.

In summary, Bubba's actions are focused on stealing the money from the clerk and then going to the forest to eat Bambi, which leads to him achieving his goal of having 0 money.
