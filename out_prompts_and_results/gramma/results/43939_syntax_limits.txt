In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market after attacking the Merchant and looting the Medicine. The Banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit has already looted the Medicine, the next step is to ensure that the Bandit can secure the coins.

The Bandit can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Market to the Bandit Camp, where she can store the coins she has or acquire more coins from the chest.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp. By moving to the camp, she can secure her loot and ensure her criminal activities are hidden from the Guard.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)"]
}
