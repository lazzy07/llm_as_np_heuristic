Bubba is currently at the forest, hungry, and wants to have money. To achieve his goal of having 1 money, he needs to take the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - Since Bubba is hungry and Bambi is alive, he can choose to shoot Bambi to eat. This action will satisfy his hunger and allow him to have food.
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to eat, as he needs to kill Bambi first.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer, which will satisfy his hunger.

After these actions, Bubba will have eaten Bambi, satisfying his hunger. However, he still has 1 money from the bank, which means he has achieved his goal of having money.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger.
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action is necessary to kill Bambi so that Bubba can eat. It is a direct action towards fulfilling his hunger.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, this action allows Bubba to consume the deer, thus satisfying his hunger.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and is no longer hungry.
