To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also maintaining the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **Zoe walks from the surface to the cave.** - This action allows Zoe to reach the Lizard, ensuring they are in the same location and can interact further.
2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Although they are already friends, this action reinforces their bond and ensures they remain allies, which is crucial for the story's resolution.
3. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the dangerous surface, where the volcano is active, setting the stage for the eruption.
4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs naturally as part of the story's setting, leading to the next critical outcome.
5. **Zoe dies.** - As a result of the eruption, Zoe is killed, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, while also maintaining the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the cave** allows Zoe to connect with the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship.
- **Making peace** is a redundant but necessary action to ensure that their friendship is solidified before the impending danger.
- **Walking back to the surface** is essential for Zoe to face the danger of the volcano, which is a key element of the story.
- **The volcano erupting** is a natural consequence of the setting and leads to the climax of the story.
- **Zoe dying** is the final outcome that fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.
