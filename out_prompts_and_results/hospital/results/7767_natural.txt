**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) so that she can assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - By admitting Jones to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess and treat him. This also increases her workload to 3, but she will still be able to assess and treat Jones correctly.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is crucial for determining Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. 

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Jones has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make him healthy. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 3, she could potentially make a mistake, but for the sake of this story, we will assume she correctly identifies the disease.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - This allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Young next.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Young also has a fever, this treatment will make him healthy.

8. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - This allows Dr. Hathaway to assess and treat Ross.

9. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms.

10. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
    - Assuming Ross has a fever, this treatment will make him healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients (Jones, Young, and Ross) are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat each patient effectively. The sequence is designed to minimize the risk of mistakes while ensuring that all patients receive the necessary treatment for their conditions.
