**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores, Ernest is in the laundry room, and Roy is in the gym with the bully. The bully, having just threatened both of them, is focused on his workout. 

1. **Action: lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**  
   - Roy decides to lock the gym door while the bully is distracted. This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him without the risk of being interrupted. 

2. **Action: kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**  
   - With the gym door locked, Roy takes the opportunity to use the knife he has hidden to kill the bully. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to breathe a little easier.

3. **Action: next_day()**  
   - The day ends, and the next day begins. With the bully dead, Roy can now focus on escaping the prison with Ernest.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Locking the gym** was crucial for Roy to ensure he could confront the bully without fear of being interrupted or attacked. It also provided a controlled environment for the confrontation.
