**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to do his chores to avoid further punishment and to keep a low profile. 

1. **Ernest does his chores in the laundry room.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to avoid punishment and to maintain his safety in the prison environment.)

After completing his chores, Ernest realizes he needs to find a way to protect himself and Roy from the bully. He remembers that the knife is in the kitchen, and he decides to head there.

2. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to retrieve the knife, which he believes will help him defend himself and Roy against the bully.)

Once in the kitchen, Ernest quickly grabs the knife. He knows that the bully is still in the gym, and he needs to act fast.

3. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is crucial for Ernest to have a means of defense against the bully.)

With the knife in hand, Ernest heads to the gym, where he knows the bully is. He must confront the bully to ensure both his and Roy's safety.

4. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to confront the bully directly.)

Upon entering the gym, Ernest sees the bully and, feeling cornered, he decides to take a stand.

5. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is essential for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both his and Roy's safety.)

With the bully now out of the picture, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He knows that he and Roy can now breathe easier without the constant threat hanging over them.

6. **Ernest goes to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to prepare for a potential escape with Roy.)

Finally, Ernest decides to find Roy and inform him of the situation.

7. **Ernest moves to the kitchen to find Roy.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to reunite with Roy and ensure they can escape together.)

Once reunited, they can plan their escape together, knowing they are no longer in danger.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at ensuring his survival and that of his friend Roy. By doing chores, he avoids punishment; by stealing the knife, he gains a means of defense; and by confronting and eliminating the bully, he removes the immediate threat. The final actions of moving to the hallway and then to the kitchen are to ensure they can escape together.
