To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the Merchant's sword after attacking her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to become armed, which is crucial for her to defend herself and potentially rob or attack others in the future.

2. **loot(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the coins from Tom's corpse. This action is essential as it directly contributes to the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from her inventory and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first arming herself, then looting the coins from Tom, and finally securing those coins in her camp.
