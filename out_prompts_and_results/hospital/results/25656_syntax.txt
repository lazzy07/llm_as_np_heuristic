To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway will admit them to an exam room to assess their condition. This increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Hathaway will treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will make Young healthy.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: Since Ross is already in Exam Room C and has been assessed with SymptomA (which we will assume corresponds to Flaze), Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics, making him healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room and assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones shows symptoms of Flaze, Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, making Jones healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
