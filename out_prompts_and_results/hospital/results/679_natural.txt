**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, decides to admit Young to Patient Room A to ensure all patients are seen. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Jones dies.

Hathaway then walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Ross is also experiencing unknown symptoms, and due to the workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect, and Ross dies as well.

Finally, Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Young. Young is experiencing unknown symptoms, and Hathaway, still under the burden of workload, mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect, and Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for the patients, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are seen is achieved, albeit with tragic results.

5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: This is required to determine Ross's condition.
6. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: Again, this is a mistake, but it is an action taken in the spirit of helping Ross.
7. **Return to Patient Room A**: Hathaway needs to check on Young, ensuring all patients are seen.
8. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: This is necessary to determine Young's condition.
