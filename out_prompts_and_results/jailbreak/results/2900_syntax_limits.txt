**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has a plan to get the pack of cigarettes that the bully owns. Ernest quickly moves to the hallway, where he can access the gym. 

Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot threaten him or Roy while he is locked away. With the bully contained, Ernest then crawls through the vents to the gym, where he confronts the bully.
