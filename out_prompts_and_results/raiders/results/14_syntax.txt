To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army ends up with the Ark of the Covenant and that the Nazis are dead. Given the current situation, the Nazis have already opened the Ark, which was dangerous, resulting in their deaths. Indiana Jones is still alive in Tanis, and the US Army is in the USA, unaware of the current situation in Tanis.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the desired ending:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army needs to travel to Tanis to retrieve the Ark. This action is necessary because they are currently in the USA and need to be at the same location as the Ark to take possession of it.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: Once the US Army arrives in Tanis, they can take the Ark from the Nazis. Since the Nazis are dead, the US Army can easily take the Ark without any resistance.

This sequence of actions ensures that the US Army successfully obtains the Ark while the Nazis are dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: This action is necessary for the US Army to reach the location of the Ark, which is currently with the Nazis in Tanis.
- **take(USArmy, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: This action allows the US Army to claim the Ark after the Nazis have opened it and died, ensuring that the Ark is now in their possession.
