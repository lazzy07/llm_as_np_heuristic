Tom, at the crossroads, sees the bandit approaching. Knowing that the bandit is armed and dangerous, he quickly decides to take action. He reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is still at the market. The guard, upon receiving the information, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

Once the guard arrives at the crossroads, he sees the bandit and, armed with his sword, he attacks and kills her. With the bandit defeated, Tom is now safe to return to the cottage carrying the medicine he purchased earlier.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. Reporting the bandit ensures that the threat is neutralized, allowing Tom to safely return home.
