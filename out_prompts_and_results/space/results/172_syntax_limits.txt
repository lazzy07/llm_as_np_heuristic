Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the cave where the Lizard is and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to be healthy and safe together. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave to join the Lizard. This action is necessary to solidify their newfound friendship and to discuss their next steps together.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: With the Lizard's agreement, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is the final step in achieving her goal of being healthy and safe.

By making peace with the Lizard, Zoe not only secures her safety but also establishes a friendship that could lead to future cooperation.
