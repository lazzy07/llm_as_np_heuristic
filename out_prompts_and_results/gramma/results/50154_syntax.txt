To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the bandit camp where she can store her coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The bandit will then walk from the crossroads to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to reach her preferred location where she can secure her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will take the coin she robbed from Tom and place it in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first and crucial step for the bandit to gain coins without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed and is an easy target.
- **Walking to Crossroads**: This action is necessary to transition from the market to the bandit camp, as the bandit needs to move to her preferred location.
- **Walking to Bandit Camp**: This action is essential to reach the location where the bandit can safely store her coins.
- **Taking the Coin to the Chest**: This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins secured in the chest at the bandit camp.
