To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation with the other characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal. He is already carrying the medicine, and by walking directly to the cottage, he fulfills his objective of being there with the medicine.

No other actions are needed because:
- The merchant and guard are not a threat to Tom at the Crossroads, and the bandit is also at the Crossroads but does not pose an immediate danger since Tom is not armed and is not engaging in any conflict.
- Tom's goal is straightforward: to reach the cottage with the medicine, and he can do so without any further complications.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
