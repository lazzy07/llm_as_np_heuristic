In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp with the Medicine, and the Bandit is at the Market. The Bandit has coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, but the Merchant is not in a position to rob or attack anyone since she is armed and does not want to become a criminal.

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads to meet Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to potentially sell the Medicine to Tom, who may have coins to trade.

After this action, the Merchant can then sell the Medicine to Tom for coins, achieving her goal of acquiring more coins without resorting to criminal activity.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The Merchant walking to the Crossroads is the only action needed to set up a potential transaction with Tom. Since Tom is at the Crossroads and the Merchant has the Medicine, this action is essential for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.
