**Story Completion:**

After finishing their chores in the laundry, Roy and Ernest are aware of the bully's presence in the gym. They know that the bully has threatened them and is dangerous. Roy decides to take action to ensure their safety and to get the pack of cigarettes.

1. **Steal the Cigarettes**: Roy quickly takes the pack of cigarettes from his pocket and hides it. This action is necessary because it gives Roy leverage over the bully, allowing him to negotiate or defend himself against the bully's threats.

2. **Go to the Hallway**: After stealing the cigarettes, Roy moves to the hallway. This action is crucial as it allows him to escape the immediate threat of the bully in the gym and gives him options to either disguise himself or escape.

At this point, Roy has successfully stolen the cigarettes and moved to a safer location, ensuring he is no longer threatened by the bully. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Steal**: This action is essential for Roy to gain control over the situation and to have something the bully wants, which can help in negotiating or defending against threats.
- **Go**: Moving to the hallway is a strategic choice to avoid confrontation with the bully and to prepare for a potential escape.
