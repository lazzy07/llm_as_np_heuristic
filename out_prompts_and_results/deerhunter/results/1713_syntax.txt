To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the Forest and needs to go to the Bank to confront the Clerk and potentially steal the money.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba is at the Bank, he can use the loaded rifle to shoot the Clerk, which will kill him and allow Bubba to take the money.
3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the Clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the Bank.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the Clerk is, as he needs to confront him to get the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the Clerk, who is the only character with money. By shooting him, Bubba can take the money without any opposition.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to collect the money after the Clerk has been killed, achieving the goal of having the money.
