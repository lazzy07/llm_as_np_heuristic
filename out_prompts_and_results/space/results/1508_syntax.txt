To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action will initiate the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet, making the environment dangerous and setting the stage for the impending disaster.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave to seek shelter from the eruption. This action is necessary for her to avoid the immediate danger of the volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave, following Zoe. This action is important as it brings both characters together in the same location, allowing for the possibility of making peace.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe and the Lizard will make peace with each other. This action is crucial as it transforms their relationship from adversarial to friendly, aligning with both characters' goals of making friends.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: Finally, the volcano will erupt, which will kill Zoe, who is still on the surface. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

The sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing for the Lizard and Zoe to become friends before the eruption occurs.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "begin_erupt(Surface)",
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)",
    "walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Starts the volcanic eruption, creating a dangerous situation.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe seeks safety in the cave, moving away from the danger of the eruption.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe, ensuring they are in the same location to facilitate friendship.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for companionship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: The eruption occurs, resulting in Zoe's death, which is a necessary conclusion to the story.
