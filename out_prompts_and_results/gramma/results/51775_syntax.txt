To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit will not need to attack or kill anyone else, as her goal can be achieved with these two actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without risking her own safety, as Tom is unarmed and cannot defend himself.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action ensures that the Bandit has coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of maximizing her coin count.
