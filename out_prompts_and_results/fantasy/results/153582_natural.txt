To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and picking it up will increase Rory's wealth, which is one of his goals.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Rory needs to return to the village to be with Talia and to ensure he can manage his wealth and happiness effectively.

3. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to Rory, this action is redundant but can be seen as reaffirming their bond, which contributes to Rory's happiness.

4. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - This action is also redundant but reinforces their commitment to each other, contributing to Rory's happiness.

5. **Rory and Talia get married.**  
   - This action solidifies their relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness.

6. **Rory becomes hungry.**  
   - This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Rory not being hungry, as he will need to eat to satisfy this condition.

7. **Rory eats Talia.**  
   - This action is a drastic measure to ensure Rory is not hungry anymore, as he needs to satisfy his hunger condition.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goals of being happy (through marriage and reaffirmation of love), wealthy (by picking up the treasure), and not hungry (by eating Talia).
