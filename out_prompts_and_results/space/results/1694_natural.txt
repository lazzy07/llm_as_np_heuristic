To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for the Lizard to confront Zoe and assess the situation on the surface, where the danger is present due to the erupting volcano.

2. **The Lizard approaches Zoe and makes peace.** - Since Zoe and the Lizard are not fighting, this action allows them to establish a friendly relationship. The Lizard's goal is to make friends, and this action directly contributes to that goal.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard discuss the danger of the erupting volcano.** - This conversation is implied as part of the peace-making process, allowing both characters to understand the situation better and work together for safety.

4. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is taken by Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. Although it makes the Lizard angry, it is necessary for Zoe's health and safety.

5. **The Lizard walks back to the cave.** - After making peace with Zoe, the Lizard returns to the cave, which is a safe location away from the danger of the erupting volcano.

By completing these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
