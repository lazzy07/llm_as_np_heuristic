To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a location where she can interact with the hero and the guard, who are both at the crossroads.

2. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant can gain favor with the guard, who is looking to eliminate criminals. This action does not make her a criminal and helps her maintain her status while potentially gaining coins from the guard for her information.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to move to the crossroads to confront the bandit based on the merchant's information.

4. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit, who is a criminal and poses a threat. The guard's action also allows the merchant to feel safe and secure in her dealings.

5. **The merchant loots an item from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - After the bandit is killed, the merchant can take the bandit's coins from her body, thus achieving her goal of acquiring more coins without becoming a criminal.

This sequence of actions ensures that the merchant successfully increases her wealth while adhering to her moral code.
