Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She knows that the Lizard is currently at the surface and is in danger. To help the Lizard, she teleports from the cave to the surface, where she can communicate with the Lizard and potentially form a friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and help him. 

Once Zoe arrives at the surface, she sees the Lizard and immediately approaches him. 

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship. By making peace, Zoe can ensure that they are no longer enemies and can work together to stay safe.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can discuss their mutual goals of health and safety. They agree to work together to find a way to ensure both of them are safe from the dangers of the surface, including the potential eruption of the volcano.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** This action is important because it allows them to move to a safer location where they can continue to build their friendship and discuss their plans without the immediate threat of danger.

Once they reach the cave, they can both feel safe and healthy, having achieved their goals of friendship and safety.
