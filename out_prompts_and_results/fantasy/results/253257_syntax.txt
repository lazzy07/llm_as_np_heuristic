To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged, and she has the treasure. The goal is to get Talia married to Rory, which will make her happy, and she already has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to travel to the Cave to be with Talia, as they are currently in different locations.
2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia will travel back to the Village where she can marry Rory.
3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory will get married, which will make Talia happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Rory to be with Talia so they can get married. Without this action, they cannot proceed to the marriage.
  
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia needs to return to the Village to perform the marriage ceremony. This is essential as the marriage can only happen in the Village where they are both present.

- **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: This action is the culmination of their relationship and fulfills Talia's goal of being happy. Since she is already wealthy due to possessing the treasure, this marriage will ensure her happiness.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "travel(Talia, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Talia, Rory, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy in the shortest possible way.
