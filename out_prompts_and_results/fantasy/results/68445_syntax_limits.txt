In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. Since she has already accepted Rory's marriage proposal, the next logical step is for them to get married. This action will make both Talia and Rory happy. However, to achieve wealth, Talia needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Talia has accepted Rory's proposal, and getting married will fulfill her desire for happiness.

After this action, Talia will be happy due to her marriage to Rory. However, she still needs to acquire wealth. Since the story requires Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy, we can assume that after the marriage, Talia will work with Rory to find a way to acquire the treasure in the cave, but that action is not explicitly stated in the current plan.

Thus, the final action that directly leads to Talia's happiness is the marriage.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia achieves her goal of happiness through marriage, while the wealth aspect can be implied as a future action after the marriage.
