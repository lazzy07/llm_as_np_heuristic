5. **The volcano erupts.** - The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is now back on the surface with the Lizard, they both need to act quickly.

6. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - They both quickly move to the cave, which is a safe location away from the eruption. This action ensures that both characters are safe from the volcanic eruption.

7. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again in the cave.** - Once they reach the cave, they reaffirm their friendship again, ensuring that they both feel secure and healthy in their relationship.
