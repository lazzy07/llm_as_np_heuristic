Tom, now armed with the merchant's sword, realizes that the merchant has the medicine he desperately needs. He decides to take action to obtain it. 

Tom walks from the market to the crossroads, where he knows the bandit is located. He then attacks the bandit, who is unarmed and unaware of Tom's intentions. After defeating the bandit, Tom loots the medicine from the bandit's belongings, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.
