To achieve Alex's goal of obtaining the jewelry, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives the jewelry to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry, and Blake currently has it. By giving it to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve their goal.

2. **Casey picks up the flowers.**  
   - This action is included to ensure that Casey can be happy as well, as Casey wants the jewelry but is currently not in a position to get it. Picking up the flowers does not interfere with Alex's goal.

3. **Blake moves to the living room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to find the chocolates, which is what Blake wants. It does not affect Alex's goal but helps Blake achieve happiness.

4. **Casey moves to the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to follow Blake and potentially trade or interact with Blake later, ensuring that Casey can also work towards their happiness.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the jewelry.
- Blake is not happy yet but is moving towards their goal of finding chocolates.
- Casey is not happy yet but is also moving towards their goal.

The final story is concise and focused on achieving Alex's goal while allowing the other characters to pursue their happiness.
