**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose them. However, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, mistakenly believing they might have Jarkis. This treatment is incorrect, and Young dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms, and Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This treatment is correct, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Jones. Dr. Hathaway finds that Jones is experiencing Unknown symptoms and treats Jones with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. This treatment is also correct, and Jones becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has treated both Ross and Jones successfully, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Young.
