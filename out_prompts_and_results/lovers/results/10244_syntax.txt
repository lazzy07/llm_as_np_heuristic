To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is necessary for Alex to be with the other characters after obtaining the flowers.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is important because it helps Alex fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which in turn aligns with Alex's own happiness.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be with Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps in the overall dynamics of the story.

6. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake. This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to ensure that all characters are happy.

7. **give(C2, I3, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex. This action ensures that Alex is happy because they now have the item they want.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers, which makes them happy.
