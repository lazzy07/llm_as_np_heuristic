To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will result in one character dying. The goal is to have Zoe and the Lizard make peace before the eruption occurs, but since the volcano is already in the process of erupting, we can have Zoe die in the eruption while the Lizard survives. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard are in the same location and are not fighting. Zoe wants to make friends, and the Lizard also desires friendship. This action allows them to establish a friendly relationship before the eruption occurs.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a consequence of the earlier action of beginning the eruption. Since Zoe is on the surface when the eruption occurs, she will die.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, and Zoe takes the initiative to make peace with the Lizard. They both express their desire for friendship, and they successfully become friends.
- However, the volcano that began erupting earlier now erupts fully. Since Zoe is on the surface when this happens, she is caught in the eruption and dies, while the Lizard, being in the cave, remains safe.

This sequence of actions fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt, resulting in Zoe's death, while also allowing for the characters to make peace.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcomes of friendship and the eruption resulting in Zoe's demise.
