To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's greed and his desire for money.

Here’s the action that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to take the money from the bank clerk.

This action is necessary because Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to move to the bank to access the money that the bank clerk has. 

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Bubba will be at the bank, and since he is greedy, he will take the money from the clerk.

Now, let's summarize the story:

Bubba, after shooting Bambi, decides to go to the bank to get the money. He moves from the forest to the bank, where he can confront the bank clerk and take the money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
