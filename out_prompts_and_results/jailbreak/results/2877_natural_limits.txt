Ernest, aware of the threat posed by the bully, decides to take a risk. He knows the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. He quickly moves through the hallway to the kitchen, where he steals the knife. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the hallway, where he can lock the gym door, trapping the bully inside.
