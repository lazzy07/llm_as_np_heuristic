Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to help the Lizard. She knows that the Lizard is not safe and that they need to work together to survive. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to reach the Lizard to help him, as she believes they can become friends and work together to escape the danger of the volcano.

2. **Zoe finds the Lizard at the surface.** - Upon reaching the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard struggling with the eruptions and realizes that they need to communicate.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to help. They both agree to put aside their differences and work together for their mutual safety.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. 

5. **The Lizard is killed by the eruption.** - Unfortunately, despite their newfound friendship, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and dies.

This sequence of actions leads to the Lizard's death due to the eruption while also establishing a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, albeit too late for the Lizard to survive. The story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, fulfilling the requirements.
