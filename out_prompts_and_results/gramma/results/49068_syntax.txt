To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently unarmed and vulnerable.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move towards the Bandit Camp where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the Crossroads, the Bandit will take the coins from Tom and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to secure her coins in a safe location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit robs Tom to acquire his coin, which directly contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.
- The Bandit then moves to the Crossroads to transition towards her camp, where she can safely store her loot.
- Finally, the Bandit places the coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring that she has achieved her goal of having coins secured.
