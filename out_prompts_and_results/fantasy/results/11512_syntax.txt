To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential because Talia needs to acquire wealth to achieve her goal of being wealthy.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially improve her happiness.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince in the village. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, this action will make both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

4. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is included to create a scenario where Vince's hunger can be addressed, which is part of his character's goal.

5. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave. This action is necessary for Vince to be in the same location as Gargax, where he can potentially address his hunger.

6. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is included to create a dramatic conclusion where Vince's hunger is resolved, but it does not affect Talia's happiness or wealth since she has already achieved her goals.
