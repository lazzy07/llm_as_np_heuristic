To achieve the goal of the Secret Agent, who wants the Mastermind to be dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Office)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Office. This is necessary because the Mastermind is believed to be at the Headquarters, and the Secret Agent needs to confront the Mastermind in a location where they can use the gun.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Office to the Headquarters. This action is crucial as it brings the Secret Agent directly to the Mastermind's location.

3. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind in the Headquarters. This is the final action that fulfills the Secret Agent's goal of ensuring the Mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that the Secret Agent can confront the Mastermind and achieve their objective without unnecessary actions or delays.
