To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will then assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary to identify his condition.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This will complete the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient** is crucial to determine their symptoms and ensure the correct treatment is administered. Without this step, Hathaway cannot know which disease each patient has.
- **Treating each patient** with the correct treatment based on their symptoms is essential for their recovery. If treated incorrectly, patients could die, which would contradict Hathaway's goal.
