To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely return to the cottage without being hindered by the other characters. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action takes him directly to his desired location.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **Tom's Goal**: Tom's primary goal is to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. Since he already has the medicine, the only action he needs to take is to walk to the cottage. There are no threats or obstacles in this scenario that would require him to engage with the other characters or items.

The other characters (Merchant, Guard, and Bandit) are at the market and do not pose a threat to Tom's goal since he is not interacting with them. Therefore, the single action of walking to the cottage is sufficient for Tom to achieve his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"]
}
