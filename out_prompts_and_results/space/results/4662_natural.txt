Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is dangerous due to the potential eruption of the volcano. To ensure their safety and health, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can be safe from the dangers of the surface. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions, follows her to the spaceship, ensuring they both remain safe together.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe teleports to the ship from the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe and healthy. By teleporting to the ship, she removes herself from the dangerous environment of the surface.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the ship.** - The Lizard follows Zoe to ensure that they can remain friends and safe together. This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of safety.

Now, both Zoe and the Lizard are safe on the spaceship, achieving their goals of health, safety, and friendship.
