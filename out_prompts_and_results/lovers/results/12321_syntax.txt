To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with the other characters and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have given away the jewelry they had.
- Blake is still unhappy because they do not have the item they want.
- Casey is now happy because they received the jewelry.

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R12, R22)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: This action allows Casey to enter the room where Alex and Blake are, enabling interaction.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: This action is the key to fulfilling Casey's goal, as it directly provides them with the item they desire, leading to their happiness.
