Zoe and the Lizard find themselves in the cave, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano on the surface. Zoe, wanting to make friends with the Lizard, decides to take a peaceful approach. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe initiates a conversation with the Lizard, expressing her desire to be friends and work together to stay safe from the volcano. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring their safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After establishing a friendly relationship, Zoe suggests they explore the surface together to find a safer location away from the volcano. This action is necessary to move to a safer area.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe to the surface, reinforcing their newfound friendship and ensuring both characters are together in a safer location.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: As they reach the surface, the volcano erupts. However, since they are now friends and have moved together, they can work together to find shelter or escape, ensuring their safety.

By making peace first, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making a friend in the Lizard while also ensuring both of them remain safe from the volcano.
