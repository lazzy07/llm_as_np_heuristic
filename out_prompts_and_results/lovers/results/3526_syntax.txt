To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the bathroom (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary for Alex to access the item they want to give to Casey.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom (R21). This action is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to give to Casey.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) with the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary to return to the location where Casey is.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because it helps Casey to be happy, which in turn helps Alex to be happy.

5. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This action is necessary for Casey to access the item they want.

6. **pick_up(C2, I3, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from the living room (R22). This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want.

7. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R12) with the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary to return to the location where Alex is.

8. **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex. This action is necessary because it helps Alex to be happy, as they now have the flowers (I1) they wanted.

9. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to check on Alex and Casey. This action is necessary for Blake to be involved in the resolution.

10. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Blake picks up the flowers (I1) from the living room (R22). This action is necessary for Blake to have the item they want.

11. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because it helps Alex to be happy, as they now have the flowers they wanted.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers (I1), which means Alex is happy. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I2, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R12)",
    "give(C1, I2, C2, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)",
    "pick_up(C2, I3, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R12)",
    "give(C2, I3, C1, R12)",
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "pick_up(C3, I1, R22)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R12)"
  ]
}
```

Each action is carefully chosen to ensure that Alex ultimately receives the flowers they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
