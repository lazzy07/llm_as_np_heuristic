### Story Completion

After admitting Young to Exam Room A and assessing them, Hathaway realizes that Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). To ensure Young's health, Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis.

Next, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Ross to Exam Room C. Since Ross is also a patient, Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms.
