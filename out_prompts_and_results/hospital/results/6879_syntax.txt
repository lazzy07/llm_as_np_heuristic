To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will then assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics if he has Flaze or steroids if he has Jarkis. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: Next, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.
