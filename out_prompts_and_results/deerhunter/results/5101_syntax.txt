To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and is hungry. The bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, while Bambi is dead. 

Since Bubba has already shot Bambi, he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. After eating, he can go back to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his goal of getting money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank. This action is essential as it brings him to the location where the clerk is, allowing him to confront the clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the clerk while holding the rifle. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
