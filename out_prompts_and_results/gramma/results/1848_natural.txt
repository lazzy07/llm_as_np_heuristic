To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her coins in the chest.

2. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Now, let's summarize the story with the actions taken:

1. The bandit, after successfully robbing the hero and buying the medicine, decides to leave the market. She walks to the bandit camp, where she has a chest containing her coins.
2. Upon reaching the bandit camp, she loots the coins from the chest, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

The bandit has now achieved her goal of carrying coins.
