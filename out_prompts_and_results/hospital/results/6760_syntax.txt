To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross** in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms.
2. **Assess Young** in Admissions to determine his symptoms.
3. **Treat Ross** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
4. **Treat Young** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

Here’s the reasoning for each action:

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake in diagnosis.
   
2. **Assess Young**: Similarly, assessing Young is crucial to determine his condition. This action also carries no risk of error due to the manageable workload.

3. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will know whether to treat him with antibiotics (if he has Flaze) or steroids (if he has Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will know the correct treatment for him as well. This action is also vital for Young's recovery.

By performing these actions, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery and fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan outlines the necessary steps to ensure all patients are healthy, aligning with Hathaway's goal.
