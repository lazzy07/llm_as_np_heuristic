To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Since Jones is still in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway will first admit Jones to an exam room. Then, Hathaway will assess Young and Ross to determine their symptoms. After assessing, Hathaway will treat each patient according to their diagnosed disease. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Admit Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomC**: This action assigns Jones to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess him later. This is necessary because Jones is currently in the admissions room and needs to be moved to an exam room for treatment.

2. **Walk Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway moves to PatientRoomC to assess Jones. This is necessary to ensure that Hathaway can evaluate all patients.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for diagnosing and treating Young.

4. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is also crucial for diagnosing and treating Ross.

5. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats him based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), PatientRoomC**: Finally, Hathaway treats Jones based on his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
