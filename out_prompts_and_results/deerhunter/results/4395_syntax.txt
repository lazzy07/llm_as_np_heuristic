To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money, which is his primary goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene of the crime and avoid any potential consequences.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba, now having achieved his goal of obtaining money, will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy his hunger after the stressful events.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will return to the bank to check if the clerk is still there. This action is necessary to ensure that he can confirm the success of his theft and see if there are any further actions he needs to take.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If the clerk is still present and poses a threat to Bubba's safety or freedom, he will shoot the clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate any potential witness to his crime, ensuring that he can keep the money without fear of being reported.

6. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will return to the forest with the stolen money, ensuring he is away from the bank and any potential consequences of his actions.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
