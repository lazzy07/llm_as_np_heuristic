**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway assesses Ross to confirm his symptoms. Since both Jones and Ross are believed to have the same symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway needs to determine if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis. This action is crucial for Hathaway to ensure the correct treatment is administered.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway determines that he has Flaze (due to the fever symptom). Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B to prepare for his assessment and treatment. This action is important to ensure that Jones is also treated promptly, as he is still in the admissions room.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Ross**: This action is essential for Hathaway to confirm the symptoms and avoid any mistakes in treatment due to the workload. It allows Hathaway to make an informed decision about the treatment.
  
- **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: This action directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. By treating Ross correctly, Hathaway helps him recover from Flaze.

- **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: This action prepares for the next step in treating Jones, ensuring that Hathaway can address his health needs promptly after Ross.
