Zoe, realizing that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano, decides to help her friend, the Lizard. She teleports from the ship to the surface, where she finds the Lizard in distress. The Lizard, aware of the imminent eruption, is trying to find a safe place to hide.
