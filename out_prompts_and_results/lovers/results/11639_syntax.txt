To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially trade or give items.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is crucial because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy.

3. **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex puts down the jewelry in the dining room. This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but can be included if Alex wants to show the item to others or if it is part of a larger plan.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R21). This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

At this point, Alex has the jewelry and is happy. The other characters can still be unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, we can conclude the story here.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the item.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, fulfilling their desire and making them happy.
- **put_down(C1, I1, R22)**: While not necessary for happiness, it can be included for narrative purposes.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action is included for continuity but does not affect the happiness outcome.
