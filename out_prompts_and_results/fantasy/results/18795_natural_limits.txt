In this story, Talia's happiness and wealth are the primary goals. To achieve this, we need to ensure that Talia acquires the treasure, which will make her wealthy and subsequently happy. 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Gargax eats Talia.** - Gargax, who is hungry and wants to be wealthy, sees Talia at the cave. By eating Talia, Gargax can potentially access the treasure that Talia believes is at the cave. This action is necessary for Gargax to fulfill his goal of not being hungry and possibly gaining wealth.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's body.** - After eating Talia, Gargax can take the treasure that Talia had access to. This action allows Gargax to become wealthy, which is his goal.

However, since Talia is dead, she cannot become happy or wealthy anymore. Therefore, the story does not achieve Talia's goals, but it does fulfill Gargax's desires.

To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can modify the actions slightly:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Gargax, who is hungry, sees Vince at the village. By eating Vince, Gargax can access the money that Vince has, which will help Gargax become wealthy.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from the cave.** - Gargax then travels to the cave and takes the treasure, fulfilling his goal of wealth.

In this scenario, Talia does not achieve her goals, but Gargax does. 

To achieve Talia's goals, we can have her pick up the treasure before Gargax arrives:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - Talia, who is at the cave, picks up the treasure, making her wealthy.

2. **Talia travels to the village.** - Talia then travels to the village to share her newfound wealth with Rory and Vince, which will make her happy.

Now, Talia is wealthy and happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Talia picks up the treasure.",
    "Talia travels to the village."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures Talia achieves her goals of becoming happy and wealthy in the shortest way possible.
