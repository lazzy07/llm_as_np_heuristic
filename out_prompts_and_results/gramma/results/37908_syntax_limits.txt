**Story Completion:**

After Tom successfully robbed the merchant, he felt emboldened and decided to confront the bandit, who was also in the market. The bandit, seeing Tom with the medicine and coins, quickly devised a plan to take advantage of the situation. 

1. **Action: rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)** - The bandit, armed with her sword, approached Tom and demanded he hand over his coins. Tom, not armed with a sword, was unable to defend himself and reluctantly gave up his coins to the bandit. This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

2. **Action: take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)** - With the coins now in her possession, the bandit decided to return to her camp. She walked to the bandit camp and placed the coins in her chest, ensuring that she had successfully secured her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (rob) is necessary for the bandit to acquire coins from Tom, which is crucial for her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
- The second action (take) allows the bandit to secure her coins in her camp, fulfilling her objective of having coins in the chest.
