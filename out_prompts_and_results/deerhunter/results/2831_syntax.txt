To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger. Since Bubba is currently in the forest with a dead Bambi, he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. After that, he can return to the bank to steal more money from the clerk, as he is still greedy.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain his strength and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary for him to return to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal more money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the clerk again. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining more money, as he is still greedy and wants to increase his wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Returns Bubba to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desire.
