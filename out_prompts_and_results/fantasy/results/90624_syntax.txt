To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he is happy. The key to achieving wealth is to obtain the treasure located in the cave. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave (Rory)**: Rory needs to go to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for him to access the treasure.
   
2. **Pickup Treasure (Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Once Rory is in the cave, he can pick up the treasure. This is essential for him to achieve his goal of wealth.

3. **Travel from Cave to Village (Rory)**: After picking up the treasure, Rory needs to return to the village to be in a safe location and to be with Talia.

4. **Give Money to Vince (Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory can give the money he has to Vince. This action is not strictly necessary for Rory's wealth but helps Vince achieve his goal of not being hungry, which is a side benefit of the story.

5. **Get Hungry (Vince)**: Vince can become hungry, which is a natural consequence of the story, but it does not affect Rory's goal.

6. **Eat (Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax can eat Vince, which is a consequence of the story but does not affect Rory's goal.

At the end of these actions, Rory will have the treasure, which fulfills his goal of being wealthy.
