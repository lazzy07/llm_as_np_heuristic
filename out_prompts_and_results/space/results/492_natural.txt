Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe to the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of safety.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave**: Once inside the cave, they find a safe spot away from the dangers of the surface. They can now focus on building their friendship and ensuring their health and safety.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
