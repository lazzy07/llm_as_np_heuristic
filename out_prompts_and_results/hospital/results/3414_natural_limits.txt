Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is currently in Patient Room B, Hathaway can assess him without needing to walk anywhere. After assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that he has a rash, which indicates that he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which makes Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young receives the care he needs, as he is currently in Admissions and has not been assigned to an exam room yet.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to assess him to determine the correct treatment. However, the story ends here with Ross being treated successfully, achieving Hathaway's goal of having at least one patient healthy.
