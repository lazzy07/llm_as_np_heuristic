**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is aware that Roy is in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that Roy has stolen the pack of cigarettes from the bully, which has made both of them a target for the bully's wrath. 

**Action 1:** Roy decides to escape from the prison. He is already on the highway, wearing the civilian clothes, which allows him to blend in and avoid detection. 

**Explanation:** This action is crucial because it directly leads to Roy achieving his goal of being alive and free. Since he is disguised, he can leave the prison without being threatened by the bully or the guards.

**Action 2:** Day one ends, and day two begins. 

**Explanation:** This marks the transition in time, but since Roy has already escaped, it signifies that he is no longer in danger.

**Final Situation:** Roy has successfully escaped from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free. Ernest remains in the laundry, but he is not threatened anymore since Roy is no longer in the prison.

This plan succinctly captures the necessary actions for Roy to achieve his goal while ensuring that the story remains focused on the characters' motivations and the constraints of the setting.
