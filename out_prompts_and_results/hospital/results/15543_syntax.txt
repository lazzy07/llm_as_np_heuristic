To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. Since Young has SymptomB (which we assume corresponds to Jarkis), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Young, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess and admit the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are currently in the Admissions room.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room A. This is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated.

5. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room C. This is also necessary for Ross to be assessed and treated.

6. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine their symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has SymptomA (which we assume corresponds to Flaze), Hathaway will administer antibiotics.

8. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine their symptoms.

9. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has SymptomA (which we assume corresponds to Flaze), Hathaway will administer antibiotics.

By following these steps, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, and the other patients will also be treated appropriately.
