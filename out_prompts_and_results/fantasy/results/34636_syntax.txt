To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage or wealth through acquiring money or treasure. Given the current situation, Talia has a proposal from Rory, and Vince has money. 

Hereâ€™s the shortest story that ends with Talia becoming happy:
