In this story, the Hero's goal is to gain control over the President. The Villain currently has the money, which they can use to manipulate the President. The Hero needs to outsmart the Villain and take control of the situation.

1. **threaten(Villain, President)**: The Hero knows that the Villain is trying to control the President. By threatening the Villain, the Hero can create a sense of fear that will make the Villain less confident and more likely to relinquish control over the President.

2. **coerce(Villain, President, Money)**: After threatening the Villain, the Hero can coerce the Villain into wanting the President to have the money. This action will make the Villain feel that giving the money to the President is in their best interest, as it will help them maintain some level of control.

3. **give(Villain, President, Money)**: The Villain, now coerced, gives the money to the President. This action allows the Hero to manipulate the situation further, as the President now has the money and is more likely to be influenced by the Hero.

4. **bribe(President, Hero, Money)**: With the money now in the President's possession, the Hero can bribe the President. This action allows the Hero to gain control over the President, achieving their ultimate goal.

By following this sequence of actions, the Hero successfully gains control over the President, outmaneuvering the Villain in the process.
