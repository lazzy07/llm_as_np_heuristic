To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. He is also greedy and wants money. The bank clerk is still alive in the bank, and Bambi is alive in the forest.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money. This action is necessary because he needs to be at the bank to steal the money from the clerk.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the clerk with the rifle. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, ensuring that he cannot defend himself or stop Bubba from taking the money.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's greed and achieve the goal of him having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and the clerk is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
