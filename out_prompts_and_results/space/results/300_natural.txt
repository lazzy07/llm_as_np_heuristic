Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard instead of fighting. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends and work together to ensure their safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing the mutual threat posed by the volcano, agrees to become friends. 

As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, causing chaos on the surface. In the ensuing panic, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and dies, while Zoe manages to teleport back to the spaceship just in time to escape the disaster.

Here’s the sequence of actions and their explanations:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: This action is taken to achieve Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard and to ensure both characters can work together for their safety.
2. **The volcano erupts**: This is a necessary event that occurs after the characters have made peace, leading to the climax of the story.
3. **The Lizard dies**: This is the outcome of the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying in the story.
4. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship**: This action allows Zoe to escape the danger of the eruption, ensuring her safety.
