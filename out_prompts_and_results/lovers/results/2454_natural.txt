To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Blake to pursue their own goal of obtaining the chocolates, which are in the dining room.

3. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Casey to follow Blake and potentially trade or interact with them regarding the chocolates.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is not happy because they still want the jewelry.

The story is complete with Alex achieving their goal of happiness.
