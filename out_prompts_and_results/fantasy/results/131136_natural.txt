To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia is the only character left alive and she believes the treasure is at the cave, Gargax can simply take the treasure without any further complications. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the cave to the cave.** (This action is redundant but emphasizes Gargax's presence in the cave where the treasure is located.)
2. **Gargax picks up the treasure.** (This action allows Gargax to obtain the treasure, which contributes to his wealth.)

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved his goal of being wealthy and not hungry, as he now possesses the treasure.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Traveling from the cave to the cave**: While this action does not change Gargax's location, it confirms that he is still in the cave where the treasure is located.
- **Picking up the treasure**: This is the crucial action that allows Gargax to become wealthy, fulfilling his primary goal.
