In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and Blake (C2) is also present but is not happy either. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action would be for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, thus making them happy.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the living room (R22).

This action is necessary because it directly addresses Alex's desire for the jewelry, which is the only item they want to achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they now have the jewelry.
- Casey will still be unhappy because they do not have the item they want (chocolates).
- Blake will remain unhappy as well.

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"]
}
