To achieve the goal of the Secret Agent, who wants the Mastermind to be dead, the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Office to the Lobby. This is necessary to get closer to the Mastermind, who is believed to be in the same location.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Courtyard)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Lobby to the Courtyard. This action is taken to position the Secret Agent in a location where they can confront the Mastermind.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Dropbox)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Courtyard to the Dropbox. This is a strategic move to create distance from the Mastermind, making it seem like they are retreating.

4. **move(SecretAgent, Dropbox, Headquarters)**: The Secret Agent moves from the Dropbox to the Headquarters. This action is taken to create a diversion, making the Mastermind think the Secret Agent is no longer a threat.

5. **move(SecretAgent, Headquarters, Office)**: The Secret Agent returns to the Office, where they can prepare for the final confrontation.

6. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: Finally, the Secret Agent uses the gun to kill the Mastermind in the Office. This is the ultimate goal of the Secret Agent, ensuring the Mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is designed to create a narrative where the Secret Agent strategically moves around the locations to ultimately confront and eliminate the Mastermind.
