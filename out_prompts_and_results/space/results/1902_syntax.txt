In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the surface uninhabitable. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. The Lizard also desires health, safety, and friendship.

To achieve these goals, the following actions will take place:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. Since they are not fighting, this action can succeed. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures that they are not enemies.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will erupt, which is a necessary event that will lead to the conclusion of the story. Since the surface is already dangerous, this action will not affect Zoe or the Lizard directly, as they are safe in the cave.

After these actions, Zoe and the Lizard will have made peace, achieving their goal of friendship, while the volcano erupts, fulfilling the condition of the story.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the actions:
- **make_peace**: This action is essential for both characters to achieve their goal of friendship. It resolves any potential conflict and establishes a positive relationship.
- **erupt**: This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of the story where the volcano erupts, leading to the conclusion of the narrative.
