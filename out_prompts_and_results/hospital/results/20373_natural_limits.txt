Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C, decides to assess Young first since they are already in the assigned exam room. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating that Young has Jarkis. This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to understand the patient's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B, allowing for a future assessment. This action is included to ensure that Ross can be treated in the next steps, although it does not directly impact the immediate goal of treating Young.

After these actions, Young is now healthy, and Dr. Hathaway's workload remains manageable, allowing for further assessments and treatments for the other patients.
