To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest after having shot and eaten Bambi, and he is aware that the bank clerk has money. The next logical step for Bubba is to go back to the bank and steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the forest to the bank to confront the clerk and steal the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba will threaten the clerk and steal the money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located. Since Bubba's goal is to obtain money, he must be in the same location as the clerk to execute his plan.
  
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully intimidate the clerk into giving up the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have achieved his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
