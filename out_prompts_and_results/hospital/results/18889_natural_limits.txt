Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A with Jones, recognizes that Jones is experiencing Fever. Since Fever is a symptom of Flaze, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. 

After administering the treatment, Jones becomes healthy. This action is crucial as it directly aligns with Jones's goal of being alive and healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is still in the Admissions room and also experiencing Fever. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now 2 (after treating Jones), they can still accurately assess Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B and treats him with antibiotics as well, ensuring that Ross also becomes healthy.

However, since the goal is for Jones to achieve health, the story concludes after Jones is treated and becomes healthy.
