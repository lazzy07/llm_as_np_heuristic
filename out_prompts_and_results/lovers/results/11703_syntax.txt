To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the chocolates), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates. This is essential for Blake to have the item that Casey wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Casey is. This is necessary for Blake to give the chocolates to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the chocolates, making Casey happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy with the jewelry they have.
- Blake is happy because they helped Casey.
- Casey is now happy because they received the chocolates.

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as the chocolates to pick them up.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake must pick up the chocolates to give them to Casey.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake needs to return to the living room to give the chocolates to Casey.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: This action directly satisfies Casey's desire for the chocolates, making them happy.
