The bandit, having just attacked the hero and looted the medicine from the merchant, is now at the crossroads with the medicine in hand. The guard is at the market, unaware of the bandit's presence at the crossroads. The banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit has already secured the medicine, the next step is to ensure that the coins are in the chest at the bandit camp.

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, which is her goal.

2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
