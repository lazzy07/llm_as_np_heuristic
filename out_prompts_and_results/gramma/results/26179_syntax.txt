To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The bandit, having just attacked the guard and the merchant, sees Tom at the crossroads. She decides to rob him, knowing he is unarmed and vulnerable.
- After successfully robbing Tom, the bandit now has an additional coin.
- The bandit then walks back to her camp, where she takes the coins from the chest, ensuring she has a significant amount of coins.

This sequence of actions allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
