**Story Completion:**

Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, knows that the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is still in the cells, threatened by the bully. To ensure both their safety and to escape, Roy decides to lock the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action will prevent the bully from threatening Ernest and give Roy a chance to help his friend.

After locking the gym door, Roy can then crawl through the vents to the highway, where he can escape from the prison. 

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Lock the gym door**: This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from being able to threaten or harm Ernest while also keeping the bully contained. It ensures that Roy can focus on his escape without worrying about the bully's immediate threat.

2. **Crawl through the vents to the highway**: This action allows Roy to escape the prison safely while disguised. Since he is wearing civilian clothes, he can blend in once he reaches the highway, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
