To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he has just eaten Bambi and head to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to intimidate the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully moves from the forest to the bank and steals the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk using the rifle he has, fulfilling his greed and ensuring he has the money.
