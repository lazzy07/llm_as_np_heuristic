To achieve the goal of either having Bubba possess the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi**: Since Bubba is hungry and Bambi is alive, he can choose to eat Bambi. This action will lead to Bambi being dead, which fulfills one of the conditions for the ending.

2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action directly results in Bambi being dead, which is one of the required outcomes.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry and wants to eat. This action sets the intention for Bubba to consume something, which is necessary for his survival and aligns with his current state of hunger.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which results in Bambi being dead. This fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead, which is one of the two possible endings.

At this point, Bubba has not acquired any money, but he has achieved the goal of having Bambi dead. 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "decide_to_eat(Bubba)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
```

This plan effectively leads to the desired outcome of Bambi being dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
