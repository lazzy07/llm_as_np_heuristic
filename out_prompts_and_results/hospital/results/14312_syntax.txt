To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and Ross is in PatientRoomC, Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing Ross's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze (fever), he will be treated with antibiotics. If he has Jarkis (rash), he will be treated with steroids. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will need to assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
