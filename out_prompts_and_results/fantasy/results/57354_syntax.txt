To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has some money and is in the cave where the treasure is located. Rory is also in the cave, and Talia has proposed to him, but they have not yet married. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases her wealth, which is one of her goals.
2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action will make both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is crucial because it allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which contributes to her wealth. Since Talia wants to be wealthy, this directly helps her achieve that goal.
  
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary because Talia has proposed to Rory, and by marrying him, she will achieve happiness. Since Talia's happiness is also a goal, this action fulfills that requirement.

By performing these actions, Talia will end up both wealthy (due to the treasure) and happy (due to marrying Rory).

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
