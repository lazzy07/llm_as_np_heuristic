**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a fever, decides to treat him for Flaze. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. To reduce the workload, Hathaway first assesses Ross, who is still in Admissions, to determine his symptoms.

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.** 
   - This action is necessary to understand Ross's condition and potentially reduce the workload by treating him if he has a disease. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**
   - Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway mistakenly treats him for Jarkis. This action is taken to reduce the workload, but it may lead to a negative outcome for Ross.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**
   - After assessing Jones and confirming he has a fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is taken to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess him later.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives appropriate treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**
   - Assuming Young has a rash, Hathaway treats him for Jarkis, which is the correct treatment if Young indeed has that disease.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to either assess or treat the patients, which is essential for Dr. Hathaway to achieve the goal of making all patients healthy. The assessment of Ross is critical to understand his condition, while treating Jones correctly ensures he recovers. Admitting and assessing Young allows Hathaway to manage all patients effectively.
