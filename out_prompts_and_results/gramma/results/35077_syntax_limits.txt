In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. The Merchant is currently at the Crossroads, and the Bandit is at the Camp with coins in a chest. The Merchant can take advantage of the situation by reporting the Bandit to the Guard, who is at the Market and wants to kill criminals.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **report(Merchant, Camp, Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit’s location to the Guard. This action helps the Merchant achieve her goal by potentially leading to the Bandit being killed, which would allow the Merchant to loot the Bandit's coins without becoming a criminal herself.

After this action, the Merchant can wait for the Guard to take action against the Bandit, ensuring that she remains within the law while increasing her wealth.

### Explanation of the Action:
