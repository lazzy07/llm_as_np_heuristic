In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is on the surface of the planet. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

To achieve this, Zoe will teleport from the spaceship to the surface, where she can interact with the Lizard. However, since the volcano is erupting, the situation is urgent. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to meet the Lizard. This action is necessary for her to interact with the Lizard and work towards making friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is included to fulfill the requirement that the story ends with the volcano erupting, which also creates a sense of urgency and danger.

In this scenario, Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard just before the eruption, ensuring that they are no longer enemies. However, the eruption results in the Lizard being killed, as it is on the surface when the volcano erupts.

The final story is concise and meets the requirements of the ending.
