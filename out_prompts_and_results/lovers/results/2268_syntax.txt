To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where the jewelry is located (the dining room).
   - This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room.
   - This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the room where Casey and Blake are located.
   - This action is necessary for Alex to be with the other characters after obtaining the jewelry.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to themselves (this is a placeholder action to indicate that Alex now has the jewelry).
   - This action confirms that Alex has the item they want, ensuring their happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
