To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomA and Ross is also in PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has the same symptom as Young (SymptomA), he will be treated accordingly. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential to ensure that Jones also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
