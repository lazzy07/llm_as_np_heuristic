To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat a human, and Vince is the only human present in the cave. By eating Vince, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and Vince will no longer be alive, which will allow him to achieve his goal of not being hungry.

2. **Vince's wealth is transferred to Gargax**: Since Gargax has eaten Vince, he can take the money that Vince had. This action is implied as Gargax takes the money from Vince's body after eating him.

3. **Gargax now has wealth**: With the money taken from Vince, Gargax achieves his goal of being wealthy.
