To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also there. Bubba is hungry and has a greed for money, while the clerk has one unit of money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, having a loaded rifle, can steal the money from the clerk. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to fulfill his greed for money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to be in a safe location after committing the theft.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Since Bubba is hungry, he decides to eat. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Bubba can eat Bambi, who is already dead. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's hunger and also ensures that Bambi is dead.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to take the money from the clerk, satisfying his greed.
- **go**: Bubba moves to a safe location (the house) after the theft.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger and decides to eat.
- **eat**: Bubba consumes Bambi, ensuring that Bambi is dead and fulfilling his hunger.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money and Bambi is dead.
