To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation with the bandit and the guard. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **The Bandit reports her location to the Guard.**  
   - The Bandit, wanting to distract the Guard from Tom, reports her own location at the Crossroads. This action is strategic for the Bandit to create a diversion.

3. **The Guard walks from Market to Crossroads.**  
   - The Guard, believing the Bandit is at the Crossroads, moves to confront her. This action removes the Guard from the Market, allowing Tom to move freely.

4. **The Bandit walks from Crossroads to Bandit Camp.**  
   - The Bandit leaves the Crossroads to avoid confrontation with the Guard, ensuring she is not in the way of Tom.

5. **Tom is now at the Cottage with the Medicine.**  
   - Since the Guard is distracted and the Bandit has left, Tom can safely reach the cottage with the medicine.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to achieve his goal without any conflict, as the Bandit and the Guard are preoccupied with each other.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "report(Bandit, location(Bandit), Crossroads)",
    "walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Tom walks to the Cottage:** This is the primary goal of Tom, and it is the final action needed to achieve his objective.
- **Bandit reports her location:** This action serves to mislead the Guard and create a distraction, allowing Tom to move without interference.
- **Guard walks to Crossroads:** The Guard's movement is a direct consequence of the Bandit's report, ensuring he is not at the Market where Tom is.
- **Bandit walks to Bandit Camp:** This action ensures that the Bandit is no longer a threat to Tom, allowing him to safely reach the cottage. 

This plan effectively allows Tom to achieve his goal while navigating the dynamics between the other characters.
