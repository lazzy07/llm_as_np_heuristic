Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B. This action is necessary because Young is currently in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Since Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease at this point. However, since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still low (2), there is no risk of making a mistake.
