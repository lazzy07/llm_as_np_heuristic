To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to help fulfill their goal.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers (I1). This is a strategic move to inform Casey of their desire, which may prompt Casey to act.

3. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) where Alex is. This is necessary for Casey to be able to give Alex the item they want.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room. This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story consistent with the items in play.

6. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) where Casey is. This is to keep Blake involved in the story, as they also want to ensure Alex's happiness.

7. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I3). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to resolve the desires of the other characters.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers they wanted, making them happy.
