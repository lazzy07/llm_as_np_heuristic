In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the chocolates (I3) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Casey (C3) has the flowers (I1) and wants the chocolates (I3) as well. Blake (C2) has the jewelry (I2) and wants the chocolates (I3) too. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **Trade**: Alex can trade the flowers (I1) they received from Casey with Blake for the chocolates (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I3) while also ensuring that Blake gets an item they want (I1), which will help Blake to be happy as well.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the chocolates (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I1) and will also be happy.
- Casey will still be unhappy as they do not have the item they want (I2).

This single action is sufficient to achieve Alex's goal of happiness.
