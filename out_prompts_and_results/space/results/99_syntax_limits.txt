1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to find the Lizard. This action is necessary for her to reach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, as they are currently in different locations.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Upon reaching the cave, Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for both characters to become friends, which aligns with their mutual goals of being healthy and safe.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is included to introduce the imminent danger that will affect the characters.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, creating a catastrophic event on the surface. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying, as the eruption will lead to a fatal outcome for one of the characters.

5. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, being on the surface when the volcano erupts, dies as a result of the eruption. This action concludes the story with a character dying, while also highlighting the tragic outcome of their newfound friendship.

In summary, the story illustrates Zoe's attempt to make peace with the Lizard, which is ultimately overshadowed by the eruption of the volcano, leading to the Lizard's demise.
