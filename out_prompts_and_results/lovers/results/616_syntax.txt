To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R11, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R11) to the living room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have given away the jewelry, but they will still be happy because they want Blake to be happy, and they have helped Alex.
- Blake will remain in the living room and will be happy as well since they want Alex to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Casey moves to the living room to be with Alex and Blake.
2. Casey gives the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire.

This sequence of actions ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
