**Story Completion:**

On day two, Roy, who is in the kitchen, realizes he needs to escape the prison. He has the knife and the pack of cigarettes, but he knows the bully is in the gym and is a threat. To ensure his safety and to avoid confrontation, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy goes to the hallway.** (This action allows Roy to move closer to the exit and away from the kitchen where he might be vulnerable.)
   
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows Roy to bypass the bully and the guards, getting him closer to freedom.)

3. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself.** (This action is crucial for Roy to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.)

4. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This is the final action that allows Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

By taking these actions, Roy successfully avoids the bully and the threats within the prison, ultimately achieving his goal of escaping.
