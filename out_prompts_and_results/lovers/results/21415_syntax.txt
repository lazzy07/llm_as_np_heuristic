To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the bathroom (R21) to get closer to the jewelry.
2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the bathroom (R21).
3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) to be in a familiar space.
4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Casey (C2) in the dining room (R12) to make Casey happy.
5. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22) to be with Blake (C3).
6. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C3) in the living room (R22) to make Blake happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C1, R12, R21)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach the bathroom where the jewelry is located.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex needs to pick up the jewelry to fulfill their desire and become happy.
- **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex returns to the dining room to interact with Casey and give them the jewelry.
- **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: By giving the jewelry to Casey, Alex ensures that Casey is happy, which is also important for Alex's happiness.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room to be with Blake, which is part of their goal to make Blake happy.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives chocolates to Blake, ensuring that Blake is happy, which indirectly supports Alex's happiness as well.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have given Casey the jewelry, which is what they wanted.
