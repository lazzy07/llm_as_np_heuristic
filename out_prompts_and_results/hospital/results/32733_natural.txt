**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.
2. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the story requires Ross to achieve his goal of being healthy. The assessment will reveal whether Ross has Jarkis (rash) or Flaze (fever). 

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids.**  
   Assuming the assessment reveals that Ross has Jarkis, this treatment is appropriate. If Ross has Jarkis, the treatment will make him healthy. If the assessment mistakenly identifies Ross's condition, the treatment could lead to a negative outcome, but the goal is for Ross to be healthy, so this action is crucial.
