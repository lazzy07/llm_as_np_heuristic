**Story Completion:**

1. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A and observes Rash.
   - This action is necessary because Dr. Hathaway needs to confirm Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. 

2. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.
   - Since Young has a rash, which is a symptom of Jarkis, treating with steroids is the correct action to make Young healthy.

3. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to check on Ross, who is still in Admissions, to ensure he receives the necessary care.

4. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.
   - This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

5. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C and observes Unknown.
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms, even though they are currently unknown.

6. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.
   - Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, and to ensure he receives treatment, Dr. Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the treatment for Flaze. This is a precautionary measure to ensure Ross's health.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients to ensure they become healthy. The assessment of Young confirms his condition, and the treatment with steroids cures him. The actions taken for Ross, although based on unknown symptoms, are necessary to ensure he is not left untreated, which could lead to a worse outcome.
