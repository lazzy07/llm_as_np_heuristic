To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom to the bathroom. This action is necessary to get closer to Casey, who is in the living room and has the flowers.

2. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bathroom to the dining room. This action is necessary to reach the living room where Casey is located.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room. This action is necessary to interact with Casey.

4. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
