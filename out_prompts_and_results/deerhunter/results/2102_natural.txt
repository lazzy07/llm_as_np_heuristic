To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba is at the bank and wants money, he will decide to steal from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary because Bubba currently has 0 money and needs to acquire it.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to shoot the clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk and take the money without resistance.

3. **Bubba picks up the money**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money that the clerk had. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
