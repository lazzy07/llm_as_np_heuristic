To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money without resistance.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to secure his position with the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk is the only character with money.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action is possible because Bubba has a loaded rifle, which gives him the power to take the money without facing any consequences from the clerk.
- **Bubba goes from the bank to the house:** This action is taken to ensure Bubba is in a safe location after acquiring the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has successfully stolen the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
