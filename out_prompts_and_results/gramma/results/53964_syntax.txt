To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the TomCoin. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs coins to fulfill her goal, and the Merchant is currently carrying a coin.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her coins in a safe location.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the TomCoin. This action is crucial because it allows the Bandit to acquire a coin, which contributes to her goal of having coins.
