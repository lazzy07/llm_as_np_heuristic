To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I3 (the item in the room). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, as Alex actually wants I3 (the flowers). However, this action is necessary to create a misunderstanding that may lead to Casey's actions.

2. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to look for the chocolates (I2) that Blake mentioned.

3. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake follows Casey to the dining room (R12) to see if they can help find the chocolates.

4. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room.

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room (R22) with the chocolates.

6. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is crucial because it allows Alex to receive an item, even though it is not the item they truly want.

7. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to check for the flowers (I3).

8. **pick_up(C1, I3, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I3) in the dining room.

9. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room (R22) with the flowers.

10. **give(C1, I3, C1, R22)**: Alex keeps the flowers (I3) for themselves, achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- The initial lie told by Blake sets up a scenario where Casey feels compelled to find the chocolates, which distracts them from the actual goal.
- The movement and picking up of items allow characters to interact with the environment and obtain items.
- The final actions ensure that Alex receives the flowers they truly want, thus achieving happiness.
