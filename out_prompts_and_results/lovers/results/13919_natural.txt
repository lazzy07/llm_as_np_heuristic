To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Blake to search for the chocolates, which he wants. It is not directly related to Alex's goal but helps to progress the story.

3. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is included to allow Casey to follow Blake and potentially interact with him regarding the chocolates or jewelry, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is not happy because he still does not have the chocolates.
- Casey is happy because they still have the jewelry.

The story concludes with Alex achieving their goal of happiness.
