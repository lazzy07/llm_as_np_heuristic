In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are currently with Casey (C3). Since Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3) that Alex gave them, Alex can simply ask Casey to give the flowers back.

**Action:**
1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)** - Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy. Since Casey is already happy with the jewelry, they have no reason to refuse.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Casey will still be happy with the jewelry.

**Final Plan:**
```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R12)"]
}
```
