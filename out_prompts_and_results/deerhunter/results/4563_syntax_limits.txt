To achieve the goal of having Bubba end up with the money or ensuring Bambi is dead (or both), we can take the following action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently in the forest and needs to be at the bank to access the money.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Bubba will be at the bank, where he can confront the bank clerk and potentially take the money.

Since the goal is to have Bubba with the money or ensure Bambi is dead, this action directly leads to the possibility of Bubba obtaining the money.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential for Bubba to move from the forest to the bank, where he can attempt to take the money from the bank clerk.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most direct way to achieve the goal of Bubba having the money.
