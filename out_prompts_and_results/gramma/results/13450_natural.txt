To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her coins in the chest.

2. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit has successfully stored the coin she stole from the hero, thus achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

The story is short because the bandit only needs to return to her camp and store the coin to fulfill her objective. The other characters do not interfere with her actions, and the bandit is able to achieve her goal without further conflict.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json

  "plan": [
    "The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.",
    "The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest."
  ]
