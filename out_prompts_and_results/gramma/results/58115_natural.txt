To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero.** The bandit, armed with a sword, can rob the hero since the hero is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the hero, which is a valuable item.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** After robbing the hero, the bandit will leave the market and head back to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she has.

3. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.** This action ensures that the bandit has the medicine secured in her possession, fulfilling part of her goal of carrying valuable items.

4. **The bandit takes the coins from the chest.** If the bandit has coins in the chest, she can take them to ensure she has as many coins as possible.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- The bandit robs the hero to acquire the medicine.
- The bandit walks to the bandit camp to secure her items.
- The bandit places the medicine in the chest to keep it safe.
- The bandit takes the coins from the chest to maximize her wealth.

These actions are necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having them in the chest at the bandit camp.
