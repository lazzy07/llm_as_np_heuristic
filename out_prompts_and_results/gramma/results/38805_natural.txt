To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. The bandit will loot the merchant's corpse to take the medicine. This action is necessary because the bandit wants to ensure that the merchant's items are no longer in play and to gain an advantage by having the medicine, which could be useful later.

2. The bandit will walk from the market to the bandit camp. This action is essential for the bandit to return to her preferred location and to secure her coins in the chest.

3. The bandit will place the coins in the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

- The bandit loots the merchant's corpse to take the medicine. This is necessary for the bandit to gain an item that could be beneficial for her future plans or to use as leverage.
