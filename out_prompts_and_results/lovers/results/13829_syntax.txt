To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I1 (the jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located (R21). This is necessary because Casey has the item that Alex wants (I1) and needs to be in the same room to give it to Alex.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the flow of the story and keeps Blake engaged in the narrative.

4. **put_down(C3, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is also not necessary for Alex's happiness but adds depth to the story by showing Blake's actions.

5. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) after receiving the jewelry. This action allows Alex to be in the same room as Blake and Casey, creating a sense of togetherness.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry (I1), which is what they wanted. The other characters' happiness is not the focus of this story, but they are still engaged in the narrative.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "give(C2, I1, C1, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "put_down(C3, I2, R22)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is designed to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
