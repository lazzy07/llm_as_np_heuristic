**Story Completion:**

Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They discuss their options and decide that they need to find a way to ensure their safety. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** (Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there are any immediate threats.)
2. **The volcano erupts.** (This is a natural consequence of the story's setting, and it creates a sense of urgency.)
3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** (This fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.)

After Zoe's death, the Lizard, feeling a deep sense of loss, reflects on their friendship and the importance of safety. The Lizard vows to protect the planet and its inhabitants, realizing that making friends is essential for survival.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Walking from the cave to the surface:** This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the danger directly and assess the situation, which is a natural step for an explorer.
- **Volcano erupts:** This is a critical plot point that fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, leading to Zoe's demise.
- **Zoe is killed:** This action is necessary to meet the story's requirement of a character dying, which also serves to deepen the Lizard's character development and understanding of friendship.
