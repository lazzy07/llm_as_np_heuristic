2. **coerce(Villain, Hero, Money)**: The Villain coerces the Hero into wanting the President to have the money. This action is necessary because it aligns the Hero's intentions with the Villain's goal, setting the stage for the Villain to gain control over the President indirectly.

3. **give(Hero, President, Money)**: The Hero, now coerced by the Villain, gives the money to the President. This action is the culmination of the Villain's manipulation, as it places the money in the hands of the President, which is essential for the Villain to achieve their goal.

4. **bribe(President, Villain, Money)**: Finally, the President, now in possession of the money, is bribed by the Villain. This action allows the Villain to gain control over the President, fulfilling their ultimate goal.
