To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk Ross to Admissions**: After treatment, Ross will walk to the Admissions room to ensure he is in a safe place and can be monitored for any further issues. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving health but is a logical step for patient care.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.
2. **Treat(Ross)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment results. This is essential for Ross to recover and achieve his goal of being healthy.
3. **Walk(Ross, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Ross walks to the Admissions room after treatment. This ensures he is in a monitored environment post-treatment.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Ross, PatientRoomB, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Ross is assessed and treated correctly, leading to his health and safety.
