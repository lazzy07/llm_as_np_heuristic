To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently in the same room (R21) as Alex, Blake (C2), and Casey (C3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because Alex wants I1 to be happy, and Casey currently has it.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) and Casey (C3) will remain in R21, but their happiness is not the focus of this story.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This action allows Casey to give the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["give(C3, I1, C1, R21)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.
