To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary for Alex to have an item to offer in a potential trade.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary to interact with them and facilitate a trade.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because Casey wants the chocolates (I2) and it will make Casey happy.

5. **trade(C3, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the flowers (I3) with Alex for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry (I1), which is what they want to be happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
