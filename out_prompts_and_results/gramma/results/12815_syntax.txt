To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the Merchant. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to take an item from the Merchant, who is now dead, and it also helps to eliminate a potential threat to the Bandit's plans.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to reach the location where the Bandit can store her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, Medicine, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the medicine and places it in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is included to ensure that the Bandit has the medicine stored safely, which may be useful later.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by looting the medicine and taking the coins from the chest, ensuring she has the maximum amount of coins possible.
