To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and Jones is assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will then assess Ross in Exam Room C. This is important to check Ross's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is currently in Admissions. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients effectively, ensuring they all become healthy.
