Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to take action against Bambi, who is also in the forest. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to shoot Bambi, which is essential for him to obtain food and potentially money.
   
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - By shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer, satisfying his hunger. Although Bambi does not have money, this action is crucial for Bubba to fulfill his immediate need for food.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer, which will alleviate his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk about the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has satisfied his hunger and achieved his goal of obtaining money.
