To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax wants to eat Rory, and it will lead to Rory's death. Although it seems counterintuitive, this action will allow Rory to take the treasure from Gargax's body after he is dead, which is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

2. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince will travel to the cave to be closer to the action and to potentially help Rory.

3. **Vince takes the treasure from Rory's dead body**: After Gargax eats Rory, Vince can take the treasure from Rory's body. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve wealth, as it allows Vince to claim the treasure that Rory had.

4. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince will propose to Talia to ensure that he can achieve happiness through marriage.

5. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia will accept Vince's proposal, leading to both characters being happy.

6. **Talia and Vince get married**: This final action solidifies their happiness, fulfilling Vince's goal of being happy and not hungry.

In this sequence, Rory achieves wealth through the treasure, while Vince achieves happiness through marriage. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "Talia accepts Vince's proposal",
    "Talia and Vince get married"
  ]

Each action is necessary to ensure that Rory ends up wealthy, while Vince achieves his goals of happiness and not being hungry.
