To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Ernest or Roy overcomes the bully's threats by escaping or getting revenge, while also considering the constraints of the actions available. Given the current situation, we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **lock_gym(Ernest, Gym)**: Ernest locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, allowing Ernest to confront him without the risk of the bully fleeing or getting help.

2. **revenge(Ernest, Bully, Gym)**: After locking the door, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully. This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring his own safety and that of his friend Roy.

3. **next_day()**: The day transitions to day two. This action is included to signify the passage of time and to set the stage for the next actions.

4. **go(Roy, Hall)**: On day two, Roy moves from the cell block to the hallway. This action is important as it allows Roy to access the vents or the highway, which is necessary for his escape.

5. **vent(Roy, Highway)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action is essential for Roy to escape the prison, as it provides a route out without being detected.

6. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Highway)**: Once on the highway, Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. This action is critical for ensuring that he can blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.

7. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Finally, Roy escapes from the prison. This action fulfills the goal of overcoming the bully's threats and achieving freedom.

By following this sequence of actions, we ensure that Ernest successfully eliminates the bully, and Roy escapes, thus achieving the desired outcome of overcoming the threats posed by the bully.
