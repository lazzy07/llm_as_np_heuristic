In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. Currently, Young is in Exam Room A with a symptom of a rash (SymptomB), which indicates they have Jarkis. Jones and Ross are in the admissions room, and their symptoms are unknown. 

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will walk to the admissions room and assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment needed.

2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will return to Exam Room A and treat Young with steroids, as Young has Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By taking these actions, Hathaway will be able to treat at least one patient effectively, ensuring that they are healthy.
