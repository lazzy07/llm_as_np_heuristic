**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still low, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated as well. Hathaway's workload increases to 2.

Dr. Hathaway then walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Ross becomes healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room A to assess Jones again. Since Jones is still experiencing Unknown, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics, assuming he might have Flaze. This is a risk, but Hathaway's goal is to ensure all patients are healthy. Unfortunately, Jones does not have Flaze and dies from the incorrect treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure Young can be assessed and treated. Hathaway's workload increases to 2 again.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment, and Young becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross and Young, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
