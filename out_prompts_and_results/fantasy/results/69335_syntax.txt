To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the cave, and Gargax can eat him to fulfill both the hunger and wealth goals, as Gargax will then take Rory's money.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Rory, Cave)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money that Rory had. This action increases Gargax's wealth.

3. **travel(Gargax, Cave, Village)**: Gargax will then travel back to the village, where Talia is located. This is necessary for Gargax to interact with Talia, who is the only other character left alive.

4. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax will eat Talia, which will not only satisfy Gargax's hunger but also allow Gargax to take any money Talia might have.

5. **take(Gargax, Money, Talia, Village)**: After eating Talia, Gargax can take any money she had, further increasing Gargax's wealth.

At this point, Gargax will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (having taken money from both Rory and Talia) and not hungry (having eaten both Rory and Talia).
