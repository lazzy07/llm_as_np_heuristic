2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard needs to find a safe place away from the danger of the volcano. The cave provides shelter and safety.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure they are both safe. This action is important for maintaining their friendship and ensuring they can work together.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is a natural consequence of the story's setting, emphasizing the urgency of their situation. 

5. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - Zoe needs to escape the eruption, ensuring her safety.

6. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** - The Lizard, already in the cave, is safe from the eruption.

7. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action reinforces their friendship and mutual understanding, ensuring that they can work together in the future.

In this sequence, both characters achieve their goals of being healthy and safe. Zoe ensures her safety by teleporting away from the danger, while the Lizard finds refuge in the cave. Their friendship remains intact, allowing for future collaboration.
