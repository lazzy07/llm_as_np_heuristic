Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take a bold step. He quickly grabs the knife from the kitchen, knowing itâ€™s his only chance to defend himself and Roy. With the knife in hand, he moves to the gym, where the bully is still occupied with his workout. 

As he enters the gym, he locks the door behind him, ensuring they are alone. The bully, surprised by Ernest's sudden appearance, turns to confront him. In a moment of desperation and determination to protect himself and Roy, Ernest lunges forward and kills the bully with the knife. 

With the bully now out of the picture, Ernest feels a wave of relief wash over him. He knows that he and Roy are no longer under threat. He takes a moment to catch his breath, then decides to head back to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier.
