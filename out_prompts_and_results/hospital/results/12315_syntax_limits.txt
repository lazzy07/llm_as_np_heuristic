**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to both exam room A and exam room C, Hathaway walks to PatientRoomC where Jones is located. With a workload of 3, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. However, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

Hathaway then treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Unfortunately, this is the incorrect treatment for Jones, who actually has Flaze. As a result, Jones does not survive the treatment.

Next, Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Young, who is still waiting there. Hathaway assesses Young and correctly identifies that Young has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, and Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he has Jarkis due to the rash symptom. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Ross becomes healthy.

In the end, Hathaway successfully treats Young and Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
