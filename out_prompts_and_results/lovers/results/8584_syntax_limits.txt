In this story, Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy. To achieve this, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry (I3) that Blake has, as Blake is currently unhappy because they do not have the item they want. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up earlier with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want (jewelry) while also making Blake happy by giving them the chocolates they desire.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Blake is also happy because they received the chocolates (I2).

Thus, Casey achieves their goal of being happy, and in the process, they also ensure Blake is happy.
