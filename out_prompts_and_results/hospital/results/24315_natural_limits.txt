Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to his high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect, but fortunately, Jones does not have Jarkis and remains alive. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds that he is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Again, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is correct, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Hathaway, still under the pressure of a high workload, mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young does not have Jarkis, but he remains alive.

In the end, all patients are alive, and Dr. Hathaway has treated Ross correctly, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
