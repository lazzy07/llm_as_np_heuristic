To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must locate the gun and then kill the mastermind. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office.**  
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to search for the gun, which is currently unknown in location. The office is a potential location for the gun.

2. **The secret agent discovers the gun in the office.**  
   - This action is crucial as the secret agent needs the gun to carry out the plan of killing the mastermind.

3. **The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby.**  
   - The secret agent must return to the lobby to confront the mastermind, who is still unaware of the secret agent's presence.

4. **The secret agent kills the mastermind in the lobby.**  
   - This action fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Move to the office:** To search for the gun.
- **Discover the gun:** To obtain the weapon needed to kill the mastermind.
- **Move back to the lobby:** To confront the mastermind.
- **Kill the mastermind:** To achieve the secret agent's goal.
