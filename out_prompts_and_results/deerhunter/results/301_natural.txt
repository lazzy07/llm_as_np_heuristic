To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Bubba goes to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to hand over the money.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - This action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having money.

4. **Bubba goes to the forest.**  
   - This action is taken to find Bambi, as Bubba may want to hunt her for food.

5. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can attempt to kill Bambi, fulfilling the condition of Bambi being dead.

6. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.**  
   - This action ensures that Bambi is dead, achieving the second part of the goal.

In summary, the actions taken by Bubba are aimed at acquiring money and potentially killing Bambi. The first three actions focus on obtaining the money from the bank clerk, while the last three actions focus on hunting Bambi.
