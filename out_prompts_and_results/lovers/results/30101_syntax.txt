To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because Casey wants the jewelry to be happy, and Alex is willing to trade since they want to help Casey.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: After the trade, Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but allows for the potential of helping Alex and Blake later.

3. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is optional but could be used later to help Alex or Blake if needed.

At this point, Casey has the jewelry (I3) and is happy. Alex and Blake are still unhappy, but the goal is to ensure Casey achieves their happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Move**: This action is included to show Casey's movement to another room, which could be relevant for future interactions or trades.
- **Pick Up**: This action is included to demonstrate Casey's ability to gather items, which could be useful for future character interactions.
