To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition, and he is hungry. The bank clerk is at the bank with one unit of money. Bambi, the deer, is also in the forest, and while Bambi wants to be alive, Bubba's greed drives him to take actions that will help him acquire money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to obtain food, which will help alleviate his hunger. Although Bambi wants to be alive, Bubba's greed and hunger take precedence in this scenario.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action satisfies his hunger, allowing him to focus on his next goal without the distraction of needing food.

3. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba then travels to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to acquire the money.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is the culmination of his greed and is necessary for him to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba kills Bambi to obtain food.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba travels to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
