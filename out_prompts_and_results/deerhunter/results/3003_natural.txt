To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba picks up Bambi's body.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confirm that Bambi is dead and to potentially use her as a means to satisfy his hunger later.
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.
3. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.
4. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** - After obtaining the money, Bubba returns to the forest, where he can decide what to do next.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Picking up Bambi's body**: This confirms Bambi's death and allows Bubba to potentially eat later if he decides to.
- **Going to the bank**: This is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money he desires.
- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money, as he is greedy and wants to have it.
- **Returning to the forest**: This action concludes Bubba's immediate goals, allowing him to be in a safe location with the money.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba picks up Bambi's body",
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk",
    "Bubba goes from the bank to the forest"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money while confirming Bambi's death.
