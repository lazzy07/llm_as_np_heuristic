Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment increasingly dangerous. She sees the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, nearby. Understanding that both of them are in a perilous situation, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure their safety and foster a friendship.

**Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**

This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which aligns with both of their goals of being healthy and safe. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the erupting volcano and potentially escape the danger together.

After making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can collaborate to find a safe place away from the volcano, ensuring their health and safety while also forming a bond of friendship.
