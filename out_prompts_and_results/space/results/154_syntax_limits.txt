Zoe and the Lizard find themselves in the cave, both feeling the tension of the impending volcanic eruption outside. Zoe, wanting to make friends with the Lizard, decides to take a step towards peace. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goal of safety and health. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are not fighting, which is necessary for the Lizard to feel secure and achieve its goal.

2. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, the Lizard feels more comfortable and decides to lead Zoe out of the cave to a safer location on the surface, away from the danger of the volcano. This action helps both characters stay safe and healthy, fulfilling the Lizard's goal.

By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard establish a friendship, allowing them to work together to ensure their safety from the erupting volcano.
