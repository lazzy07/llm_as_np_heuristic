1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and help him, as she cannot assist him from the ship.

Once on the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard and approaches him. She knows that they need to work together to ensure their safety.

With their newfound friendship, Zoe and the Lizard can now escape the danger of the erupting volcano together.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** - This action is necessary for both characters to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface.

Once they reach the cave, they are safe from the eruption, and both characters feel healthy and secure. They have also formed a friendship, achieving their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

The final story is as follows:
- Zoe teleports to the surface.
- Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.
- Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.
