To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the bank clerk and is now back in the forest. He is hungry and has a desire for money. The bank clerk is still alive and is at the bank, but Bubba has the advantage of the rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to return to the bank to confront the clerk again. This is necessary because he needs to get more money.
   
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary to eliminate the clerk, allowing Bubba to take all the money without any resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This is the final action that fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Going to the bank** is essential for Bubba to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a necessary action to ensure that Bubba can take the money without any opposition.
- **Picking up the money** is the final step to achieve Bubba's goal of having money.
