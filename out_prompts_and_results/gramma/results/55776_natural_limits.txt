The bandit, armed with both the bandit's sword and the merchant's sword, sees the guard at the market. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her plans, she decides to take action. The bandit attacks the guard, killing him. With the guard out of the way, the bandit can now safely loot the guard's coin, which she adds to her collection. 

Now, with the guard dead and no one left to challenge her, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her coins in the chest. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the guard**: The bandit needs to eliminate the guard to ensure her safety and to continue her plans without interference. Since the guard is not armed, the bandit can successfully kill him.
2. **Loot the guard's coin**: After killing the guard, the bandit can take the coins he was carrying, which helps her achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible.
3. **Walk to the bandit camp**: The bandit needs to return to her camp to secure her coins in the chest, ensuring her goal is fully achieved.
