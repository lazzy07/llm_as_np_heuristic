In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship, and the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the surface uninhabitable. Zoe, wanting to be safe and healthy, decides to teleport back to the spaceship. However, this action angers the Lizard, who believes Zoe is abandoning the planet and its creatures.

To resolve the situation, Zoe realizes that she needs to make peace with the Lizard to foster a friendship. She teleports back to the surface, where the Lizard is located, and attempts to communicate her intentions. The Lizard, seeing Zoe's willingness to return and engage, decides to listen. They both express their desires for safety and friendship, leading to a mutual understanding.

However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts violently, causing chaos. In the ensuing panic, the Lizard is caught in the eruption and tragically dies. Despite the unfortunate outcome, Zoe's efforts to connect with the Lizard were genuine, and she leaves the planet with a heavy heart, having learned the importance of friendship and the fragility of life.
