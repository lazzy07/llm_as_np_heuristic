To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her marrying Rory, who also desires happiness and wealth. Since Talia is already married to Rory, we will focus on acquiring the treasure from the cave, which will make Talia wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.** (This action is necessary to bring Vince to the village where Talia and Rory are, allowing for further actions to take place.)
2. **Vince gives the money to Talia.** (This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she currently has no money.)
3. **Talia travels from the village to the cave.** (This action is necessary for Talia to access the treasure located in the cave.)
4. **Talia picks up the treasure.** (This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy.)

After these actions, Talia will have both happiness from her marriage and wealth from the treasure, thus achieving her goal.
