**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the danger posed by the bully, decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. 

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to get the knife to protect himself and Roy from the bully.)
2. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This gives him the means to defend against the bully.)
3. **Ernest moves back to the hallway.** (He needs to be in a position to confront the bully.)
4. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to access the gym without being seen by the bully.)
5. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (He needs to confront the bully without being trapped.)
6. **Ernest enters the gym and kills the bully with the knife.** (This eliminates the threat to both him and Roy.)
