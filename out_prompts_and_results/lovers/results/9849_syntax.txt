To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room to the bedroom. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I3) to Alex. This action is taken because Casey wants to help Alex be happy, and by giving them the flowers, Casey is trying to build goodwill.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room to the bedroom. This is necessary for Blake to also interact with Alex and help them.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the crucial action that directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the item they want.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the final action that directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.
