In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) that Casey (C3) has, while Casey is already happy with the jewelry (I3) that Alex gave them. Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I2) that are in the dining room (R21). To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, they need to get the chocolates.

Here’s the shortest story where Blake achieves their goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R21) to pick up the chocolates (I2).

This action is necessary because it allows Blake to access the chocolates, which is the item they want to be happy.

After this action, Blake will have the chocolates, making them happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["move(C2, R12, R21)"]
}
