To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to further solidify their friendship and to ensure they are in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures both characters are together in a safe environment.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event highlights the importance of their previous actions in ensuring their safety.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
