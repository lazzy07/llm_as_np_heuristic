To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure in the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary because Vince needs to acquire the treasure to increase his wealth, which is essential for Rory's goal since Rory is married to Talia, who is married to Vince as well.

2. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Vince needs to return to the village with the treasure to share it with Talia and Rory, which will contribute to their happiness and wealth.

3. **Vince gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action is implied as part of the narrative. By giving the treasure to Talia, it will increase her wealth, which indirectly contributes to Rory's happiness since they are married.

4. **Talia gives the treasure to Rory.**  
   - Talia, now wealthier, gives the treasure to Rory, fulfilling Rory's desire for wealth and contributing to his happiness.

5. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure now in his possession, Rory achieves happiness.

6. **Rory becomes not hungry.**  
   - Since Rory is now wealthy, he can afford food, thus satisfying his need to not be hungry.

At the end of these actions, Rory has achieved all of his goals: he is happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
