**Story Completion:**

After admitting Ross and Jones to their respective exam rooms, Hathaway, who is currently in PatientRoomC, decides to assess Ross first. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Ross is alive and healthy. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing, Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he has Flaze. However, if Ross actually has Jarkis, this could lead to a fatal mistake. 

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Young, who is still waiting there. 

4. **Admit Young**: Hathaway admits Young to PatientRoomB, where Jones is located, to ensure he can be treated next.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Ross's condition and decide on the appropriate treatment. Despite the risk of error due to workload, it is essential to try to help Ross first.

2. **Treat Ross**: This action is crucial as it directly impacts Ross's health. If Hathaway treats him correctly, he will recover. If not, it could lead to Ross's death, but Hathaway is focused on helping patients.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to check on Young, who is still in the admissions room. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to.

4. **Admit Young**: By admitting Young to an exam room, Hathaway ensures that he can be assessed and treated, fulfilling the goal of helping all patients.
