To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) where the flowers are located. This is necessary for Alex to be able to pick up the flowers.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the living room. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves to the bathroom (R12) to check on Casey, who is currently in the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to ensure that Casey is also happy, which is part of Alex's goal.

4. **tell(C1, C2, I2, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to mislead Casey into thinking that Alex's happiness depends on the chocolates, which may prompt Casey to act.

5. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) to find the flowers, believing that Alex wants the chocolates. This action is necessary for Casey to potentially give Alex the item they want.

6. **give(C2, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire and makes Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
