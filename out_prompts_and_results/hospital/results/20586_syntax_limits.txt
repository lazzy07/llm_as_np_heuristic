In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Jones, who has been assessed and shows symptoms of a rash (SymptomB), indicating he has Jarkis. Ross is in exam room B, but his symptoms are unknown. Young is in the admissions room, and his symptoms are also unknown.

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in exam room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Ross's condition is crucial for providing the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, if he shows symptoms of Jarkis (the rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By assessing Ross first, Hathaway can avoid any mistakes that could arise from a high workload and ensure that both Jones and Ross are treated correctly.

Here’s the complete story with the actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is essential to ensure he can provide the correct treatment.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: If Ross is found to have Jarkis, Hathaway treats him with steroids, making him healthy.

After these actions, both Jones and Ross will be healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
