1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to understand Jones's condition and determine the appropriate treatment. Since Jones is experiencing "Unknown," this assessment is crucial to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones using Steroids.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming that Jones has Jarkis (due to the unknown symptoms), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids. This is a risk since the symptoms are unknown, but it is the only treatment available. If Jones has Jarkis, he will become healthy; if not, he may die.

**Final Explanation:**
The actions taken by Dr. Hathaway are focused on assessing and treating the patients to achieve the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. The assessment of Jones is critical to identify his condition, and the treatment follows based on the assumption of his symptoms. Admitting and assessing Ross ensures that he also receives the necessary care.
