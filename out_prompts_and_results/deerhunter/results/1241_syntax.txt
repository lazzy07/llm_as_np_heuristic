To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will leave the forest where he shot Bambi and head to the bank to get the money.
   - **Explanation**: Bubba is greedy and wants money, so he needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money.
   - **Explanation**: Bubba is greedy and wants the money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can steal from the clerk.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest.
   - **Explanation**: Bubba may want to hide or enjoy his newfound wealth in a more secluded area.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also confirming that Bambi remains dead, thus satisfying the conditions of the story.
