**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to act quickly.

1. **Roy escapes from the prison.** Since he is already on the highway and wearing civilian clothes, he can leave the prison without being detected. This action is crucial for Roy to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

2. **Ernest does his chores in the laundry room.** While Roy escapes, Ernest decides to do his chores in the laundry room. This action is necessary for him to avoid the bully's wrath and to stay alive, as he needs to maintain a low profile.

3. **The bully remains in the gym.** The bully, unaware of Roy's escape, continues to spend time in the gym, believing he still has control over the situation. This action keeps the bully occupied and prevents him from threatening Ernest further.

By the end of the first day, Roy has successfully escaped the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free. Ernest, meanwhile, has managed to stay out of trouble by completing his chores.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Roy escaping is the primary action that allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and free.
- Ernest doing his chores is a defensive action to avoid confrontation with the bully and to ensure his own survival.
- The bully remaining in the gym serves to illustrate that he is not a threat to either character at this moment, allowing the story to conclude without further conflict.
