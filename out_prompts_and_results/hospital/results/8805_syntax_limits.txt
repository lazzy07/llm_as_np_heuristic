**Story Completion:**

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Jones to exam room B. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

2. **Admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Ross to exam room C. This is also necessary for the same reason as above, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and can be treated.

3. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room A. This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, assuming Young has that disease. This action is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (admitting Jones and Ross) are necessary to ensure that all patients are in exam rooms where they can be assessed and treated. This is part of Hathaway's goal to make all patients healthy.
- The third action (assessing Young) is critical to identify the symptoms and determine the correct treatment. Without assessment, Hathaway cannot know how to treat the patients effectively.
- The fourth action (treating Young) is the culmination of the previous actions, as it directly addresses the health of the patient. By treating Young correctly, Hathaway ensures that one patient becomes healthy, contributing to the overall goal of patient health.
