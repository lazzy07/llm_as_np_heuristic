To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom carries the medicine with him.**  
   - Since Tom has already purchased the medicine from the merchant, he is already carrying it. This action confirms that he has the medicine when he arrives at the cottage.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage while carrying the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking from the crossroads to the cottage:** This is the only way for Tom to get to the cottage, which is his goal.
- **Carrying the medicine:** This is a confirmation of Tom's possession of the medicine, which he already has from previous actions.
