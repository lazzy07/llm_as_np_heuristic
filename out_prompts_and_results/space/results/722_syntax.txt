To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk to the cave to find a safer location away from the dangerous surface, especially since the volcano has begun to erupt. This action helps the Lizard to ensure its safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave, ensuring that both characters are together in a safer location. This action reinforces their friendship and allows them to support each other.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by moving to the cave.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they are already friends, this action can symbolize the strengthening of their bond in a safe environment. It emphasizes their mutual goal of being healthy and safe.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
