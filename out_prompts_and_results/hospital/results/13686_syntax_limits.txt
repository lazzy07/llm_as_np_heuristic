To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, and if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also treated appropriately.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
