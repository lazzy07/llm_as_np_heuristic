To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation carefully. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: Tom needs to move towards the bandit camp to confront the bandit and take her sword, which will allow him to defend himself and potentially take the coins from the bandit.

2. **rob(Tom, BanditSword, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: Since Tom is now armed with a sword, he can rob the bandit, taking her sword. This action is necessary for Tom to become armed and to eliminate the threat posed by the bandit.

3. **attack(Tom, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: With the bandit now unarmed (after being robbed), Tom can attack and kill her. This is crucial as it removes the bandit from the equation and allows Tom to loot her for coins.

4. **loot(Tom, BanditCoin, Bandit, Bandit Camp)**: After defeating the bandit, Tom can loot her for the coins she was carrying. This action is essential for Tom to have coins, which he may need later.

5. **walk(Tom, Bandit Camp, Crossroads)**: Tom then walks back to the crossroads, where he can make his way to the cottage.

6. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This is necessary for Tom to confront the bandit and take her sword.
- **Robbing the Bandit**: This action allows Tom to become armed, which is crucial for his survival and success in the next steps.
- **Attacking the Bandit**: Eliminating the bandit is essential to ensure Tom can safely loot her for coins.
- **Looting the Bandit**: Acquiring coins is important for Tom's future interactions, even if he doesn't need them immediately.
- **Walking back to the Crossroads**: This is a necessary step to return to a central location before heading to the cottage.
- **Walking to the Cottage**: This final action fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
