To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, who has already proposed to her and is currently in possession of money. The quickest way for Talia to achieve her goal is to marry Vince, which will make them both happy, and then Talia can take the money from Vince, making her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal by marrying him. This action makes both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's happiness requirement.
   
2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: After marrying Vince, Talia takes the money from him. This action fulfills Talia's goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, Talia is both happy (from marrying Vince) and wealthy (from taking the money), achieving her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, as she needs to be in a happy relationship with Vince.
- **take**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve wealth, as she needs to acquire the money that Vince possesses.
