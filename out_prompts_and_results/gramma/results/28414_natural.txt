To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in a position to interact with the bandit, who is at the crossroads.

2. **The merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant ensures that the guard will take action against the bandit, which will help her avoid any criminal implications while also potentially leading to the bandit being killed.

3. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard needs to arrive at the crossroads to confront the bandit based on the merchant's report.

4. **The guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the bandit, allowing the merchant to loot the bandit's chest without any risk of being considered a criminal.

5. **The merchant loots an item from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - The merchant takes the bandit's coins from the chest, thus achieving her goal of acquiring more coins.

This sequence of actions ensures that the merchant successfully increases her wealth while remaining within the bounds of legality.
