To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has the money but is not in the forest, so Bubba cannot steal it from the clerk directly. However, Bubba can use the rifle to hunt Bambi, which would satisfy his hunger and potentially allow him to take the money from the clerk later.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to satisfy his hunger, and Bambi is the only available source of food in the forest.
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action fulfills the decision to shoot Bambi and results in Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After killing Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer, which satisfies his hunger.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of eating, and Bambi is dead. The story ends here, as Bubba has satisfied his hunger, and Bambi is no longer alive.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of eating, as he needs to eliminate a source of food.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after killing Bambi.
