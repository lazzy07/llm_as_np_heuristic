To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant takes the Medicine from the Merchant's location (Camp) to the Bandit Camp.** This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to move the Medicine to a location where it can be sold or used to gain coins.

2. **Bandit robs the Merchant to take the Medicine.** The Bandit, being a criminal and armed, can rob the unarmed Merchant. This action allows the Bandit to acquire the Medicine, which can be sold or used for profit.

3. **Bandit takes the Medicine to the Chest at the Bandit Camp.** This action allows the Bandit to store the Medicine in the Chest, which is a strategic move to keep it safe and potentially use it later for a profit.

4. **Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads.** This action is necessary for the Merchant to return to a neutral location where she can continue her business without being in the Bandit Camp.

5. **Merchant buys a coin from the Merchant's location (Camp) using the Medicine.** This action allows the Merchant to convert the Medicine into a coin, thus achieving her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal.

6. **Merchant walks from the Crossroads to the Market.** This action is necessary for the Merchant to reach her preferred location, the Market, where she can continue her business.

By following this sequence of actions, the Merchant successfully acquires a coin while avoiding criminal activity.
