**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Ross in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis, which is incorrect. However, she treats him for Jarkis with steroids.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids. Since Ross does not have Jarkis, he dies. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to admit Young.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.

5. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young.

6. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. Since Young does not have Jarkis, he dies as well.

8. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones.

9. **Admit Jones to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.

10. **Walk to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Jones.

11. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

12. **Treat Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. Since Jones does not have Jarkis, he dies as well.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Ross, Young, and Jones, Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is ultimately not achieved, as all patients die due to her mistakes. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing each patient is necessary to determine their condition, even though mistakes are made due to the high workload.
- Treating each patient is essential to attempt to make them healthy, but the incorrect treatments lead to their demise.
- Walking between rooms is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to manage her patients and assess them properly.
