To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **Steal**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk since he is greedy and wants money. He has a loaded rifle, which allows him to perform this action.
2. **Go**: Bubba will go from the Bank to the Forest, where Bambi is located.
3. **Shoot**: Bubba will shoot Bambi with the rifle, killing her.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money. He can successfully steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle, which gives him the power to intimidate the clerk.
- **Go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba needs to move to the Forest where Bambi is located to achieve the second part of the goal.
- **Shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead. Bubba uses the rifle to shoot Bambi, which also aligns with his greedy nature, as he may see Bambi as a potential food source.
