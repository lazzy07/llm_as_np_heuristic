Ernest, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's survival. He has the knife, and he understands that the only way to eliminate the threat posed by the bully is to confront him directly. 

Ernest takes a deep breath, grips the knife tightly, and approaches the bully. In a swift motion, he stabs the bully, killing him instantly. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison and ensuring that he and Roy can be free.

Now that the bully is dead, Ernest can safely unlock the gym door and make his way back to the hallway. He can then put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself for the escape. Once disguised, he can crawl through the vents to the highway and finally escape from the prison.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free, as it removes the immediate threat and allows for a successful escape.
