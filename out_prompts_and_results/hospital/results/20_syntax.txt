To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Ross's condition will help Hathaway manage his workload and ensure that all patients are treated appropriately.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to assign Ross to a room where he can be treated.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Young's condition is also understood and managed.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room B. This allows Young to be treated in a designated area.

5. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for Jones's treatment.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for that disease. This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.

7. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.

8. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, all patients can be assessed and treated correctly, leading to Jones achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
