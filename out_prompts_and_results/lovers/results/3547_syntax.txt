To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to maintain social interaction.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) to check on Alex. This action is included to show that Casey is engaged in the story and is aware of Alex's actions.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21) to join Casey and Alex. This action keeps the characters together, which is important for their happiness.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters can still pursue their happiness, but the story focuses on Alex achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the dining room to pick up the flowers.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: This is the crucial action that makes Alex happy by obtaining the flowers.
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex returns to the living room to be with the other characters, maintaining social interaction.
- **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey's movement shows engagement and concern for Alex's happiness.
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake's movement also reflects the interconnectedness of their happiness goals. 

This sequence ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers.
