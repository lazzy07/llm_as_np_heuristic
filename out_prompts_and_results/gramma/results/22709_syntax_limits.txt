To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Merchant, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is currently at the Cottage with the medicine. By walking to the Cottage, she can bring the medicine to Tom.

This action is essential because it allows Tom to obtain the medicine he desires. Since Tom is already at the Cottage, he will be able to receive the medicine from the Merchant once she arrives.

After this action, Tom will be at the Cottage with the medicine, fulfilling his goal.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Merchant, Cottage, Crossroads)"]

This plan ensures that Tom achieves his goal in the shortest possible way, with only one necessary action.
