To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is already in the bank with the clerk, and he is greedy and hungry. The clerk has money, and Bubba has a loaded rifle. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba can steal the money from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle. This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's greed and to ensure he has money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can leave the bank and go back to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but helps to illustrate Bubba's movement after the theft.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Since Bambi is already dead, Bubba can eat Bambi. This action is not necessary for achieving the goal of having money but adds to the narrative of Bubba satisfying his hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go**: This action shows Bubba's movement after the theft, although it does not affect the outcome.
- **eat**: This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger by consuming Bambi, who is already dead.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
