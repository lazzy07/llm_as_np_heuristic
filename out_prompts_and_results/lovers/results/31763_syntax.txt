To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom (R12) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.
