To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to bring the money he has to the village, where Rory and Talia are located. 

2. **Vince gives the money to Rory.**  
   - This action allows Rory to become wealthy, as he receives the money from Vince.

3. **Rory picks up the treasure from the cave.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to gain additional wealth, as the treasure is located in the cave.

4. **Rory becomes happy.**  
   - With the money and treasure, Rory achieves his goal of happiness.

5. **Rory is not hungry.**
