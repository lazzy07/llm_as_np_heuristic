After completing his chores in the laundry, Roy finds himself in the hallway. He knows he needs to escape the prison to be truly free. He decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry to disguise himself. With the disguise on, he feels more confident about his chances of getting out. 

Roy then crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. Once he arrives at the highway, he takes a moment to ensure no guards are watching. With a deep breath, he steps out of the vents and onto the highway, successfully escaping the prison.
