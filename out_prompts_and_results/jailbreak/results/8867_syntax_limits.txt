Roy decides to go to the kitchen to retrieve the knife. He knows that having a weapon could help them defend themselves against the bully if necessary. 

Once in the kitchen, Roy takes the knife and heads back to the hallway. He then crawls through the vents to the gym, where the bully is currently spending his recreation time.
