In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit has already robbed Tom of a coin and purchased medicine from the Merchant, who is now dead. The Bandit is currently at the Market, where the Guard is also present. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit can take the following action:

1. **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp and take the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of having coins.
