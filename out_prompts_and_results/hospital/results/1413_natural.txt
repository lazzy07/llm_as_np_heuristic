**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway needs to assign Young to an exam room to assess their condition. This action increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine their symptoms. Since Jones is in Patient Room B, this action is incorrect, but Dr. Hathaway is unaware of Jones's actual location due to the workload.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway correctly assesses Young's condition in Patient Room B. This is necessary to determine if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   *Explanation:* Assuming Young has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids. If Young has Jarkis, this will make them healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway needs to go to Patient Room A to assess and treat Jones.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine their symptoms. However, due to the workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing they have Jarkis. Since Jones does not have Jarkis, this treatment fails, but Jones is still alive.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway, now at Patient Room C, assesses Ross and treats them for Flaze, assuming they have a fever. This treatment is correct, and Ross becomes healthy.

9. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway needs to check on the remaining patient, Young, who is now healthy.

10. **Dr. Hathaway confirms all patients are healthy.**  
   *Explanation:* Dr. Hathaway checks on the status of all patients, ensuring that Jones, Ross, and Young are alive and healthy.

**Final Outcome:** Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, despite the treatment error.
