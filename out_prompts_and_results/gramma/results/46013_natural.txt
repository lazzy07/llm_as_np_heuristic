To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the market where the merchant is located, allowing her to potentially steal coins or items.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant and takes the medicine.**  
   - The bandit is armed and the merchant is not, allowing the bandit to successfully rob the merchant. The medicine is valuable and can be used as leverage or traded later.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After robbing the merchant, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to either stash the medicine or prepare for further actions.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her loot and potentially store the medicine.

5. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having valuable items (the medicine) in her possession at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first moves to the market to confront the merchant, as this is where she can find the merchant's coin and medicine.
- By robbing the merchant, the bandit gains a valuable item without risking her own safety since the merchant is unarmed.
- Returning to the crossroads and then to the bandit camp allows the bandit to secure her loot and fulfill her goal of having items in her camp.
