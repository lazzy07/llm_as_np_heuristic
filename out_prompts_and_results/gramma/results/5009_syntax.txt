To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will leave the Camp and head to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with the Bandit and Tom.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will walk to the Camp, leaving the Crossroads. This action is necessary because the Bandit needs to be away from the Crossroads to avoid confrontation with the Guard.

3. **report(Merchant, location(Bandit), location(Guard))**: The Merchant will report the Bandit's location to the Guard. This action is crucial as it will lead to the Bandit being attacked by the Guard, allowing the Merchant to loot the Bandit's coins without becoming a criminal.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk from the Market to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit.

5. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit at the Crossroads. This action is necessary to eliminate the Bandit, allowing the Merchant to loot the Bandit's coins.

6. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit for the coins. This action allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.

7. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the Merchant will walk back to the Camp, where she can safely keep her coins.
