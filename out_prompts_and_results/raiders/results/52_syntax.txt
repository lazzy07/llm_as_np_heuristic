To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant while ensuring that the Nazis are dead. Given the current situation, the Nazis are already dead after opening the Ark, which was dangerous. The US Army currently has the Ark, and Indiana Jones is alive. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army already has the Ark, so this action is not necessary. The US Army retains the Ark after taking it from Jones.
2. **take(Jones, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: This action is also not necessary since the Ark is already with the US Army.
3. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: This action is not necessary because the Ark is already dangerous, and the US Army would not want to open it.

Since the Nazis are already dead and the US Army has the Ark, we can conclude the story without any further actions. 

The final situation is:
- The US Army has the Ark.
- The Nazis are dead.
- Indiana Jones is alive.

Thus, the story ends with the US Army having the Ark and the Nazis being dead.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

**Explanation of the actions:**
- No actions are needed because the conditions of the story already meet the desired ending. The US Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead after their attempt to open it.
