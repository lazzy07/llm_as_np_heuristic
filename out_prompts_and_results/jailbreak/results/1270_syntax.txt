**Story Completion:**

After stealing the pack of cigarettes from the bully, Ernest finds himself in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes. He knows that both he and Roy are threatened by the bully, who is currently in the gym. 

To ensure his safety and that of his friend, Ernest decides to take action. He moves to the gym and locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This prevents the bully from threatening them further.
