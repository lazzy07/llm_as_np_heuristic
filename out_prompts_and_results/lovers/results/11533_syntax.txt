To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1 - flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where Alex is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to help them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to receive an item, which may help in their happiness.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to be with Alex and Blake. This is important for Casey to be present to facilitate further actions.

4. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I2, R21)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) for the chocolates (I2) with Alex. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to finally obtain the flowers they want, thus achieving their happiness.

5. **put_down(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I2) after the trade. This action is necessary to reflect that Alex no longer holds the chocolates.

6. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) after the trade. This final action ensures that Alex has the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.
