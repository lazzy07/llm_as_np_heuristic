In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). 

Here's the completed story:

1. **Casey moves to the dining room (R12)**: This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C3)**: This action is crucial because Casey wants Blake to be happy, and by giving the jewelry to Blake, Casey can ensure that Blake is satisfied, which in turn makes Casey happy as well.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Move (C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them. This action allows Casey to be present where the jewelry is located.
  
- **Give (C3, I3, C2, R12)**: By giving the jewelry to Blake, Casey fulfills their desire to make Blake happy, which in turn makes Casey happy as they achieve their goal.

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have successfully made Blake happy by giving them the jewelry.
