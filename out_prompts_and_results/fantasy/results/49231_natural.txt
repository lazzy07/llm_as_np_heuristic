To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. Gargax eats Vince. (This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and by removing him from the story, Rory can take the money without competition.)
2. Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body. (This action allows Rory to become wealthy by acquiring the money that Vince had.)
3. Rory's happiness increases as he now has the treasure and the money, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Gargax eats Vince.** - Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, sees Vince as a threat because he has money. By eating Vince, Gargax satisfies his hunger and removes a competitor for wealth.
   
2. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.** - With Vince out of the picture, Rory can now take the money that Vince had. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve his goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Rory will have the treasure and the money, fulfilling his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
