The bandit, having just attacked and killed the hero at the crossroads, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard and the merchant are at the market, and she believes they are unaware of her presence at the crossroads. 

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market. (This action allows the bandit to approach the merchant and the guard, who are both at the market, to further her goal of acquiring coins.)
   
2. The bandit robs the merchant, taking the medicine. (The bandit is armed and the merchant is not, allowing her to take the medicine without any resistance. This action is crucial as it helps the bandit gain an item of value.)

3. The bandit walks back to the crossroads. (This action allows the bandit to return to a safer location after committing the robbery, where she can regroup and plan her next move.)

4. The bandit walks to the bandit camp. (This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store her loot and ensure her safety.)

At the end of these actions, the bandit has successfully acquired the medicine and can now store it in her chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the market**: The bandit needs to confront the merchant and the guard to achieve her goal of acquiring coins or items.
- **Robbing the merchant**: This is a direct action to take an item of value (the medicine) from the merchant, which is essential for the bandit to achieve her goal.
- **Walking back to the crossroads**: This action is strategic for the bandit to avoid confrontation with the guard after committing the robbery.
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This final action secures her loot and ensures her safety, completing her objective.
