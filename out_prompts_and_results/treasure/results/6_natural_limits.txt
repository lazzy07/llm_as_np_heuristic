Hawkins, having successfully dug up the treasure, stands triumphantly beside the chest. However, he knows that Silver, the cunning pirate, is eyeing the treasure with greed. To achieve his goal of keeping the treasure for himself, Hawkins hesitates, but Silver, sensing the opportunity, quickly approaches Hawkins.

Silver, with a sly grin, proposes a deal. "Letâ€™s share the treasure, Hawkins. We can split it right down the middle." Hawkins, wanting to keep the treasure all to himself, considers the offer but ultimately decides to hand over the treasure to Silver, believing that it would be safer in the hands of a pirate.
