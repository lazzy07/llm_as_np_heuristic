To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves from the Crossroads to the Market, where she can interact with Tom and the Merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed. She takes the coin that Tom has, increasing her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads with the stolen coin.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coin from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Bandit starts at the Crossroads and needs to reach the Market to interact with Tom and the Merchant.
- By robbing Tom, the Bandit successfully increases her coin count without risking her own safety, as Tom is unarmed.
- After acquiring the coin, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads, where she can safely take the coins from the chest at her camp.
