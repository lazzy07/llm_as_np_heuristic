To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (the jewelry), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to pick it up and eventually give it to Casey.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Blake to have the item that Casey wants.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Casey is located. This is necessary to facilitate the transfer of the jewelry to Casey.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the chocolates.
- Blake is happy because they have given away the jewelry, which aligns with their goal of making Alex happy.
- Casey is happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
