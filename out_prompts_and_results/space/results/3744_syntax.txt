To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: The Lizard will approach Zoe and attempt to communicate, expressing a desire for friendship. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensures they are not fighting, which would jeopardize their safety.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, the Lizard will walk back to the cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to return to a safe location, away from the dangers of the surface.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures that both characters are in a safe location together.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will reaffirm the peace with the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy in their new environment.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety, health, and friendship.
