Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, armed and dangerous. Knowing he is unarmed, Tom decides to take a cautious approach. He quickly reports the location of the bandit to the guard, who is still at the market.

The guard, alerted by Tom's report, rushes to the crossroads. Upon arrival, the guard confronts the bandit, who is now outnumbered. The guard, armed with his sword, attacks the bandit, successfully defeating her. With the bandit incapacitated, Tom can now safely walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine.

This action sequence is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. By reporting the bandit, he ensures that the threat is neutralized, allowing him to return home safely.
