**Story Completion:**

As day one progresses, Ernest finds himself in the gym with the bully. The bully, feeling powerful, decides to spend more time in the gym, enjoying the intimidation he holds over Ernest. Meanwhile, Roy is busy doing his chores in the laundry room, unaware of the tension building in the gym.

Ernest, feeling threatened, knows he needs to act quickly. He decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from leaving and to gain some control over the situation. He locks the gym door, trapping both himself and the bully inside.

With the door locked, Ernest feels a surge of courage. He knows that the only way to ensure his survival and that of his friend Roy is to confront the bully. He takes the knife he has hidden in the gym and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. 

With the bully dead, Ernest feels a mix of relief and fear. He knows he must escape before the guards arrive. He quickly crawls through the vents to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he knows Roy has in the laundry room. 

Once in the hallway, he disguises himself with the civilian clothes, making sure he looks like a regular person. He then makes his way to the highway outside the prison, where he successfully escapes, leaving the prison life behind.
