To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the money from Vince and ensuring they are no longer hungry. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Gargax needs to go to the cave to find Talia, who is currently there, and to check if she has any items that can help him.

2. **Gargax eats Talia.**  
   - Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Eating Talia also allows Gargax to take any items she may have, which could include the money.

3. **Gargax takes the money from Talia's body.**  
   - After eating Talia, Gargax can take the money that Talia had, which will increase Gargax's wealth.

4. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Gargax needs to return to the village to ensure they are in a location where they can be safe and enjoy their wealth.
