To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, which means she has the potential to marry either of them. However, since she is currently in the Village and Vince has the Money, the best course of action is for Talia to marry Vince, as this will make her happy and also increase her wealth.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which makes both of them happy. This fulfills Talia's goal of happiness.
2. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: After marrying Vince, Talia can take the Money from Vince, which fulfills her goal of being wealthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness. Since she has accepted Vince's proposal, marrying him is the next logical step. This action also aligns with her goal of being happy.
  
- **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: After marrying Vince, Talia can now take the Money he possesses. This action is necessary for her to achieve her goal of wealth, as she currently has no money of her own.

With these two actions, Talia achieves both her goals of happiness and wealth.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
