**Story Completion:**

Ernest, realizing the threat posed by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is currently locked in the gym and that he has the knife. To ensure his and Roy's safety, he sneaks back to the gym door and locks it securely. With the bully trapped inside, Ernest feels a surge of confidence. He then crawls through the vents to the highway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he had seen in the laundry room earlier. Disguised and free, he makes his escape from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Lock the gym door**: This action is crucial as it prevents the bully from coming after Ernest and Roy, ensuring their immediate safety.
2. **Crawl through the vents to the highway**: This allows Ernest to bypass the prison guards and reach the outside world without being detected.
3. **Put on the civilian clothes**: This disguises Ernest, making it possible for him to escape without being recognized as a prisoner.

By taking these actions, Ernest successfully achieves his goal of staying alive and escaping the prison.
