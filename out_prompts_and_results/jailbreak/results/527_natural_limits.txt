As the day progressed, Roy, having completed his chores in the kitchen, decided to take a risk. He knew that Ernest was in the cells, threatened by the bully, and he had the civilian clothes that could help them escape. 

Roy quickly moved from the kitchen to the hallway, where he could hear the distant sounds of the gym. He took a deep breath and put on the civilian clothes, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he felt a surge of confidence.
