To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to acquire the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he is and head to the bank. This action is necessary for him to reach the location where the money is held.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he can use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba confirms his greed and desire for money, solidifying his action of taking the money from the clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten Bambi, to the bank, where the money is located.
  
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling the requirement for Bubba to have the money.

- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action reinforces Bubba's intention and greed for money, confirming that he has successfully taken the money from the clerk.

With these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.
