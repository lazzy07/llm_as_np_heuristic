To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the story can be completed as follows:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba decides to leave the bank and head to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to find Bambi to fulfill his greed for money by potentially using Bambi as a source of food or a distraction.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot Bambi. This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and needs to eat, which will also help him satisfy his greed indirectly by providing sustenance.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action is necessary to satisfy Bubba's hunger, which is a priority for him at this moment.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba decides to get money again, as he is now satisfied and can think about his greed for money once more.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of satisfying his hunger and indirectly fulfilling his greed for money by consuming Bambi, which is a resource he can use.
