To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while the volcano is about to erupt. The goal is to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard moves to the cave to find shelter from the impending eruption. This action is necessary to show that the Lizard is seeking safety, which aligns with both characters' goals of being safe.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard. This action is important as it shows her concern for the Lizard and her desire to make friends.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace. This action is crucial as it fulfills their mutual goal of friendship and safety, despite the dangerous situation.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption that will lead to a character's demise.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the death of the Lizard. This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying while also showing the consequences of the dangerous environment.

In summary, the actions taken lead to the Lizard seeking safety, Zoe showing concern, both characters making peace, and ultimately, the eruption of the volcano resulting in the Lizard's death. This sequence of events aligns with the characters' goals and the story's requirements.
