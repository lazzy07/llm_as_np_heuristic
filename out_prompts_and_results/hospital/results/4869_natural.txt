3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**

   *Explanation: Now that Young is assigned to an exam room, Hathaway can assess Young's symptoms, which are rash.*

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   *Explanation: Since Young has a rash, Hathaway correctly treats Young for Jarkis, which will make Young healthy.*
