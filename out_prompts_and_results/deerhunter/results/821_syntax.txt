To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will move from the Forest to the Bank to confront the Clerk and potentially steal the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the Clerk at the Bank.
3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the Forest.
4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will shoot Bambi, ensuring that Bambi is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the Clerk and take the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the Clerk since he has a loaded rifle, fulfilling the goal of Bubba having the money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba needs to return to the Forest after stealing the money to complete his actions in a safe location.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json

    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",

This sequence of actions effectively leads to Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead, achieving the desired outcome.
