In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. The current situation shows that Rory is already married to Talia, which contributes to his happiness. He has some money but no treasure. To achieve his goal, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave where Talia is currently.

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Rory's goal:

1. **Travel**: Rory travels from the Village to the Cave to join Talia and pick up the treasure.

This action is necessary because Rory needs to be at the same location as the treasure to acquire it. By traveling to the cave, he can also ensure that he is with Talia, which maintains his happiness.

After Rory travels to the cave, he can pick up the treasure, which will make him wealthy. Since he is already happy due to his marriage to Talia, and he is not hungry, this action fulfills all of Rory's goals.
