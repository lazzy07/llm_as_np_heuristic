To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Since Jones is currently in the admissions room and has a symptom (SymptomA), Hathaway can admit him to an exam room. This action is necessary to start the treatment process for Jones.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Similarly, Ross is also in the admissions room and has the same symptom (SymptomA). Admitting him to an exam room is essential for his treatment as well.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young, who is already in Exam Room C. This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently unknown.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure he receives the correct treatment.

5. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to confirm his symptoms. This is also necessary for his treatment.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: After assessing Young, if it is determined that Young has Jarkis (which is likely given the context), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids. This is essential for Young to become healthy.

7. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, if it is confirmed that he has Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is necessary for Jones to become healthy.

8. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, if it is confirmed that he has Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This is necessary for Ross to become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Young will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, as will Jones and Ross.
