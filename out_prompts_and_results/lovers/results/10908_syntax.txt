To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake wants item I2, which is currently unknown to us. However, we know that Casey has item I1, and Alex has item I3. 

The goal is to have Blake end up with item I2, which can be achieved through a series of trades and movements. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Blake tells Alex that Casey has item I2 in the living room.** (This is a lie, but it will prompt Alex to act.)
2. **Alex moves to the living room to check for item I2.** (Alex believes Blake's lie and wants to help.)
3. **Blake picks up item I1 from Casey.** (Blake now has an item to trade.)
4. **Blake gives item I1 to Casey.** (Blake is trying to make Casey happy, which is part of their goal.)
5. **Casey gives item I2 to Blake.** (Casey is happy to receive item I1 and gives away item I2.)
6. **Blake is now happy because they have item I2.**

### Explanation of Actions:
- **tell(Blake, Alex, I2, R21)**: This action is necessary to mislead Alex into thinking that Casey has the item Blake wants, prompting Alex to move.
- **move(Alex, R21, R12)**: Alex moves to the living room to find the item they believe Casey has, which is a part of their goal to help Blake.
- **pick_up(Blake, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up item I1 from Casey, which is a step towards trading for item I2.
- **give(Blake, I1, Casey, R21)**: Blake gives item I1 to Casey, making Casey happy and facilitating the trade.
- **give(Casey, I2, Blake, R21)**: Casey gives item I2 to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire and making them happy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json

    "give(Blake, I1, Casey, R21)",
    "give(Casey, I2, Blake, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want, while also considering the happiness of the other characters involved.
