To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, we need to ensure that the villain maintains their control over the president while also manipulating the hero. The following actions will lead to this outcome:

1. **threaten(Villain, Hero)**: The villain has already threatened the hero, instilling fear in them. This action is crucial as it establishes the power dynamic where the hero is afraid of the villain, making them more susceptible to manipulation.

2. **coerce(Villain, Hero, Money)**: The villain has coerced the hero into wanting the money for themselves, which further solidifies the villain's control over the hero's intentions. The hero is now focused on the villain's desires.

3. **steal(Hero, Money, Bank)**: The hero steals the money from the bank, which is a necessary action to provide the villain with leverage.

4. **give(Hero, Villain, Money)**: The hero gives the money to the villain. This action is essential as it allows the villain to bribe the president, ensuring that the villain can manipulate the president's actions.

5. **bribe(Villain, President, Money)**: The villain bribes the president with the money received from the hero. This is the final action that establishes the villain's control over the president, achieving the desired outcome.

By following this sequence of actions, the villain successfully controls the president, while the hero remains under the villain's influence due to fear.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "threaten(Villain, Hero)",
    "coerce(Villain, Hero, Money)",
    "steal(Hero, Money, Bank)",
    "give(Hero, Villain, Money)",
    "bribe(Villain, President, Money)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to maintain the villain's control over both the hero and the president, ultimately leading to the villain's success in the story.
