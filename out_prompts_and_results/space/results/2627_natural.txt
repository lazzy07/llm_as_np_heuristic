Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure her safety and potentially make peace with the Lizard. She teleports to the cave where the Lizard is located, hoping to communicate and establish a friendship.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and attempt to make peace. It also puts her in a safer location away from the erupting surface.

Once Zoe arrives at the cave, she finds the Lizard and attempts to communicate her intentions.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendship. Since they are not fighting, they can now work together for mutual safety.

With their newfound friendship, Zoe and the Lizard decide to leave the cave and head back to the surface to assess the situation together.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk from the cave to the surface.** - This action is taken to confront the erupting volcano together, showcasing their alliance and willingness to face challenges as friends.

As they reach the surface, the volcano erupts, and unfortunately, Zoe is caught in the eruption.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is the climax of the story, leading to Zoe's demise. It fulfills the requirement of having a character die while also highlighting the consequences of the dangerous environment.
