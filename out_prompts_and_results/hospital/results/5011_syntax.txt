To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Hathaway's workload will increase to 2, but this is manageable.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: This action allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young's symptom is unknown, this assessment is crucial for deciding the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis (which is a possibility since we don't know Young's symptoms yet), Hathaway will treat Young with the correct medication. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Jones is still in the admissions room, Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine their symptoms.

5. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat Jones with the correct medication, ensuring Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Ross is already in an exam room, Hathaway will assess Ross to confirm their symptoms.

7. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct medication, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
