The secret agent, now in the office with the papers and the gun, realizes that the time has come to confront the mastermind. The agent knows that the mastermind is still alive and poses a threat. 

To achieve the goal of eliminating the mastermind, the secret agent takes the following action:

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. (This action is necessary to confront the mastermind, who is believed to be in the lobby.)

2. The secret agent kills the mastermind in the lobby with the gun. (This action directly fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.)

After these actions, the situation is as follows: The secret agent is alive, and the mastermind is dead.

### Explanation of Actions:
