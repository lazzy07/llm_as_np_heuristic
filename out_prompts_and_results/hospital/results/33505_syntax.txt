To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they will mistakenly believe Jones has the same symptoms as Young (SymptomA). This is necessary to determine the treatment for Jones.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics, believing that Jones has Flaze due to the mistaken assessment. This action is crucial because it will lead to Jones becoming healthy, even though the treatment is incorrect.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Hathaway will then assess Ross, who is also in the admissions room. Since Hathaway's workload is now 2, they will correctly identify Ross's symptoms (which we will assume to be a rash, indicating Jarkis).

4. **Treat Ross with steroids**: Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young again to confirm their symptoms. Since Young is already in the system with SymptomA, Hathaway will treat Young with antibiotics.

6. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
