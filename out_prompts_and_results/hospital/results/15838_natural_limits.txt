Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway is unaware of the actual condition. However, with a workload of 2, Hathaway is still able to make an accurate assessment. 

After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, mistakenly believing that Young might have Flaze due to the Unknown symptoms. Fortunately, Young actually has Flaze, so the treatment is successful, and Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are seen and treated. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C. Since Jones is also experiencing Unknown symptoms, Hathaway again treats Jones with antibiotics, believing they might have Flaze. If Jones has Flaze, the treatment will be successful, and Jones will also become healthy.

With both Young and Jones treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
