To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely return to the cottage without being hindered by the other characters. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks directly from the crossroads to the cottage, carrying the medicine. This action is necessary as it allows Tom to reach his desired location with the medicine.

This is the only action needed because Tom is already at the crossroads with the medicine, and there are no threats or obstacles preventing him from walking to the cottage. The other characters are at the market, and since Tom is not a criminal, he can safely walk to the cottage without any conflict.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it directly fulfills Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine. There are no other characters in the way, and since Tom is not armed, he cannot engage in any conflict, making this a straightforward path to his goal.
