To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to check for the jewelry, which is believed to be there.
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the bathroom.
3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room with the jewelry.
4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake, making Blake happy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to go to the bathroom to find the jewelry, which is believed to be there.
- **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the jewelry, which is necessary for Blake's happiness.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to return to the dining room to give the jewelry to Blake.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: This final action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, thus achieving Blake's goal of happiness.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they will have the jewelry they wanted.
