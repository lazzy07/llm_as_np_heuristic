To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. However, Ross is already in Exam Room C, and Hathaway needs to assess him to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze (fever), he will be treated with antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis (rash), he will be treated with steroids. 

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will need to assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This will help determine Young's symptoms.

4. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat him accordingly to ensure he becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is also in the admissions room, to determine his symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
