To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit starts at the Cottage and walks to the Crossroads. This action is necessary for the Bandit to move to a location where she can interact with other characters.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, now at the Crossroads, robs Tom, who is carrying the Merchant's coin. This action is crucial for the Bandit to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit now has the coin and can walk to the Bandit Camp to place the coins in the chest. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal through these actions, as she ends up with coins in her possession and can store them in the chest.
