To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway successfully treats all patients, leading to their health and survival. Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will achieve this:

1. **walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: Ross moves from the admissions room to exam room C. This is necessary to get Ross into an exam room where he can be treated.

2. **admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Ross to exam room C. This is necessary for Hathaway to be able to assess and treat Ross.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomA, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in exam room C. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, assuming Ross has Jarkis (the rash). This is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**: Jones moves from the admissions room to exam room A. This is necessary to get Jones into an exam room where he can be treated.

6. **admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway admits Jones to exam room A. This is necessary for Hathaway to be able to assess and treat Jones.

7. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomB, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in exam room A. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

8. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, assuming Jones has Flaze (the fever). This is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

9. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, as Young is already in exam room A and has been assessed with SymptomB. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
