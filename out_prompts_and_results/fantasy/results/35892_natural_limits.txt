In the current situation, Talia is at the village, and Rory is at the cave. Gargax, who is also at the cave, is hungry and desires wealth. Vince has the money but is not in a position to help Talia become happy or wealthy directly. 

To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.** (This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Rory needs to acquire it to help Talia become wealthy.)
2. **Rory travels back to the village with the treasure.** (This action is necessary for Rory to bring the treasure to Talia, which will make her wealthy and potentially happy.)

After these actions, Talia will have the treasure, which will make her wealthy, thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave:** This is essential for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is the item that will provide her with wealth.
- **Rory travels back to the village with the treasure:** This brings the treasure to Talia, allowing her to achieve her goal of wealth.
