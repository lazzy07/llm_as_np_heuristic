Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money. He approaches the bank clerk, who has 1 money. Bubba, with the rifle loaded, threatens the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money to Bubba. With the money in hand, Bubba leaves the bank satisfied.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and demand the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.
3. **Bubba decides to eat**: This action reflects Bubba's initial hunger, but it is not necessary for the ending since he has already achieved his goal of obtaining money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement.
