**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but they proceed anyway. Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis due to the high workload and the unknown symptoms. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. Fortunately, Young does not have Jarkis, but the treatment does not harm them, and they remain alive and healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones in Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Flaze, as they are experiencing a fever. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing them.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room A to assess Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C and finds that Ross has Flaze as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing them too.

In the end, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
