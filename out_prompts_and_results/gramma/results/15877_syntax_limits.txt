In the current situation, the Bandit has already attacked the Merchant and is in the Market with the Guard and Tom. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Merchant is dead, the Bandit can loot the Merchant for the medicine and any coins she might have had. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the Merchant had. This action helps the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more items.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit then takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting the Merchant**: This action is necessary for the Bandit to gain items that can help her in her goal. Since the Merchant is dead, the Bandit can take the medicine and any coins, which increases her wealth.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action ensures that the Bandit maximizes her coin collection, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as possible.
