Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. The Lizard, also on the surface, senses the threat and knows that they must act quickly to ensure their safety and the safety of Zoe. 

1. **Zoe walks to the Lizard**: This action is taken to approach the Lizard and initiate communication, as Zoe wants to make friends and the Lizard is the guardian of the surface. 

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendly relationship, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy. 

3. **The Lizard walks to Zoe**: The Lizard reciprocates by walking towards Zoe, showing willingness to engage and communicate. 

4. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe**: The Lizard also makes peace, solidifying their friendship and ensuring that both characters are no longer enemies. 

5. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave**: Together, they walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting surface. 

6. **The volcano erupts**: This event occurs after they have moved to the cave, ensuring that both characters are safe from the eruption. 

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also forming a friendship.
