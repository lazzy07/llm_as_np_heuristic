**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, feels a surge of hope. He knows that Ernest is still in the laundry room, threatened by the bully. Roy decides to take action to ensure both of their safety.

Roy quickly crawls back through the vent to the laundry room, where he finds Ernest. He whispers to Ernest, "I have a plan. We need to get out of here." 

Ernest, still holding the pack of cigarettes, looks worried but trusts Roy. They both know that the bully is still in the gym, unaware of their movements. 

Roy then suggests, "Letâ€™s lock the gym door to keep the bully trapped inside." They move to the hallway, and Roy locks the gym door, effectively securing the bully. 

With the bully locked away, Roy and Ernest can now focus on escaping. They head back to the highway, where Roy helps Ernest put on the civilian clothes. 

Now disguised, they both feel a sense of freedom. They walk together to the edge of the highway, where they can finally escape from the prison.
