In the current situation, Casey (C3) is unhappy because they want the jewelry (I3), which they currently possess. However, they also want Blake (C2) to be happy, who is currently unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R21). 

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, they can take the following action:

1. **Tell (C3, C2, I2, R12)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move because it may prompt Blake to consider trading or giving away the chocolates, which would ultimately lead to Casey's happiness.

This action is necessary because it sets the stage for Blake to potentially give or trade the chocolates, which would make Blake happy and allow Casey to focus on their own happiness.

After this action, the situation would change as follows:
- Casey would be happy if they can get the chocolates from Blake, and Blake would also be happy if they can fulfill their own desire.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["tell(C3, C2, I2, R12)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest possible action that allows Casey to work towards their goal of happiness while also considering Blake's happiness.
