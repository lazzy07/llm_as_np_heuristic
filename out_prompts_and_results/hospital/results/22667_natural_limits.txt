Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to his high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his actual condition but results in Jones becoming healthy due to the nature of the story's logic. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting. Hathaway assesses Ross and finds he is also experiencing Unknown. Again, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats him with steroids, resulting in Ross becoming healthy as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. Young is also experiencing Unknown, and Hathaway, still under the mistaken belief that all patients have Jarkis, treats Young with steroids, making him healthy too.

In this way, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
