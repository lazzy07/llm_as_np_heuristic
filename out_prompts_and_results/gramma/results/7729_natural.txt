**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword and now possessing the medicine, decides to take advantage of the chaos at the market. She knows that the guard is a threat to her freedom and her coins, so she quickly formulates a plan.

1. The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads. (This action allows the bandit to create distance from the guard and the hero, making it harder for them to confront her.)
2. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. (This action takes her to a safe location where she can store her coins and the medicine without the threat of being attacked.)
3. The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp. (This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest, ensuring her safety and wealth.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit first moves away from the market to avoid confrontation with the guard, who is likely to attack her for her criminal actions.
- By moving to the bandit camp, she secures a safe space where she can store her ill-gotten gains without fear of being pursued.
- Finally, placing the hero's coin in the chest at the bandit camp ensures that she has achieved her goal of having coins stored safely, thus completing her objective.
