To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (jewelry), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) to be closer to Alex and Casey.
2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) to be with Blake and Alex.
3. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) they picked up earlier to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R21). This action is taken because Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy, and by receiving chocolates, Blake can feel happy.
4. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R21). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to receive the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake is happy because they received chocolates (I2).
- Casey is happy because they received the jewelry (I3).
