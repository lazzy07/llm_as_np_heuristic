To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures that they are not enemies.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary for the Lizard to ensure its safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action is important for Zoe to stay close to her new friend and also to ensure her own safety.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by moving to the cave.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also becoming friends.
