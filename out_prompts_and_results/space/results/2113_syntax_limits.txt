Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she looks at the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. They have already made peace, but Zoe knows that to truly achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends, she needs to solidify their bond. 

To do this, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard again, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring that they can work together to stay safe on the dangerous surface.

By making peace, Zoe achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard, which also contributes to both of their safety and health.
