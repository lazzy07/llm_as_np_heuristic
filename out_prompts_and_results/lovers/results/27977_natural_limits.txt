In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. Since Alex has already given flowers to Blake, Blake can now take action to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
Blake picks up the chocolates from the bathroom.

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because Blake wants the chocolates, and since they are currently in the living room, Blake can only achieve their goal by picking them up from the bathroom. This action directly leads to Blake being happy, as they now have the item they want.
