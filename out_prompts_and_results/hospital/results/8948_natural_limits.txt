Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis, which is incorrect, but this is the only assessment that can be done at this moment.

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones does not have Jarkis, this treatment is ineffective, and Jones dies. This action reduces Dr. Hathaway's workload by one.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross and Young, who are still waiting.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A, where Young can be assessed and treated later.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has reduced their workload and has taken steps to ensure that Young can be treated properly, achieving the goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, even if it means facing the unfortunate outcome with Jones.
