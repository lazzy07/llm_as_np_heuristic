To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the following actions will be taken:

1. **take(Nazis, Ark, Jones, Tanis)**: The Nazis have already taken the Ark from Indiana Jones, which is crucial for their plan to achieve immortality.

2. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis will travel to the USA with the Ark, as they believe they can open it safely there.

3. **open(Nazis, Ark, USA)**: The Nazis will open the Ark in the USA. Since the Ark is not dangerous (as indicated), this action will grant them immortality.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary because the Nazis need to possess the Ark to use it for their goal. They have already taken it from Indiana Jones, so this action is confirmed.
- The second action is essential for the Nazis to move to a location where they can safely open the Ark. They believe they can do this in the USA.
- The final action is the culmination of their plan. By opening the Ark, they will achieve their goal of immortality, as the Ark is confirmed to be safe.
