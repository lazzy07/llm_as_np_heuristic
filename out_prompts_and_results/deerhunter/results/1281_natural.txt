To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with a loaded rifle and wants to have money. The clerk has no money and is alive. Bambi is in the forest and is alive but does not have any money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential threat and also has no money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money without any opposition.
   
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** This action directly fulfills the first part of the ending condition, as it results in the clerk being dead.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling the second part of the ending condition where Bubba has the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and the clerk is dead, achieving the goal of the story.
