**Story Completion:**

On the second day, Roy, who is in the hallway, decides to take action to help both himself and Ernest. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that Ernest is threatened, Roy quickly crawls through the vents to the gym. Once inside, he finds the bully and, with the knife he has stolen from the kitchen, he kills the bully. This act of revenge not only eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest but also allows them to breathe easier in the prison.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to the hallway, where he can put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Once disguised, he can make his way to the highway and escape from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
