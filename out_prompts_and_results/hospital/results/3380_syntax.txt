### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Assessing each patient**: This is crucial for Hathaway to understand the symptoms and provide the correct treatment. Without this step, Hathaway cannot ensure the patients receive the right care.
- **Treating each patient**: This is the final step to ensure that all patients become healthy, which is Hathaway's ultimate goal. Each treatment must match the symptoms identified during the assessment.

By following this plan, Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
