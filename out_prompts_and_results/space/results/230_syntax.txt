To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action has already been taken, so the volcano is in the process of erupting.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, which is essential for making peace.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship between them, which is one of their goals.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which will lead to the death of one character on the surface. Since Zoe is now in the cave, she is safe, but the Lizard, who is still on the surface, will die.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends before the eruption occurs.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This sets the stage for the volcano to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe to move closer to the Lizard, facilitating the opportunity for them to interact positively.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action is essential for achieving the goal of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling both characters' desires for connection.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This final action leads to the conclusion of the story, resulting in the Lizard's death due to the eruption.
