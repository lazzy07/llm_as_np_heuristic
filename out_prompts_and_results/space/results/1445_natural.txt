**Story Completion:**

Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport to the surface to confront the Lizard and try to make peace. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (Zoe wants to address the situation directly with the Lizard, as she believes that communication is key to resolving their differences.)
   
2. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** (The Lizard senses Zoe's presence and feels it is important to confront her as the guardian of the surface.)

3. **Zoe and the Lizard begin to talk.** (This action is implied as they are both present and not fighting, allowing for a potential resolution.)

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** (Both characters realize they share the same goals of health, safety, and friendship. They decide to work together rather than as enemies.)

5. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** (The eruption is a natural consequence of the setting, and since both characters are now friends, they can face this challenge together.)

6. **Zoe and the Lizard escape the eruption together.** (This action is implied as they work together to find safety, ensuring both characters survive despite the eruption.)
