### Story Completion

1. **The Bandit Reports to the Guard**: The bandit, realizing that the guard is at the market and the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to report her own location to the guard. This action is strategic as it creates a diversion, allowing her to manipulate the situation to her advantage.

2. **The Guard Moves to the Crossroads**: The guard, upon receiving the report from the bandit, moves to the crossroads to confront the bandit. This action is necessary for the guard to fulfill his goal of dealing with criminals.

3. **The Bandit Robs the Merchant**: While the guard is distracted by the bandit, the bandit takes the opportunity to rob the merchant, who is unarmed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant, which is crucial for her goal of accumulating coins and items.

4. **The Bandit Returns to the Camp**: After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp, carrying the medicine. This action ensures that the bandit can secure her loot and avoid confrontation with the guard.
