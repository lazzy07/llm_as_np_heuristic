Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit, also armed, nearby. Knowing that he needs to get back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take a bold action. He attacks the bandit, who is not armed with a sword, and kills her.
