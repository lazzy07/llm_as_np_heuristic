To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room to the living room. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the item they want to give to Alex.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R21)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to help Alex, even though it does not directly make Alex happy.

3. **move(C3, R11, R21)**: Casey moves from the bedroom to the living room. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake.

4. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

5. **move(C1, R21, R11)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom. This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
