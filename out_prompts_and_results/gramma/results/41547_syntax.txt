To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit is already at the cottage, so she will walk to the crossroads to access the market where she can find Tom and the merchant.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit will then walk to the market to confront Tom, who is carrying a coin.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom of his coin since Tom is unarmed and the bandit is armed. This action allows the bandit to increase her coin count.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the crossroads.

5. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp to store her coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal.

- By robbing Tom, the bandit gains a coin without any risk since Tom is unarmed.
- Returning to the camp allows the bandit to secure her coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal.
