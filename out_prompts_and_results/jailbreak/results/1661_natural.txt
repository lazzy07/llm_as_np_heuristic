**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is strategically chosen to ensure that Ernest can eliminate the bully's threat while also preparing for his escape. Locking the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from escaping and retaliating. Crawling through the vents allows for stealthy movement, and taking the knife is essential for self-defense. Killing the bully is the only way to ensure safety for both Ernest and Roy.
