To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross might have in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. Since Ross is in Exam Room B, and assuming he has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting there. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to, but it is not directly related to Ross's goal.

4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones also receives the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids. This ensures that all patients are healthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: To determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat Ross**: To ensure he becomes healthy.
3. **Walk to Admissions**: To check on Jones.
4. **Assess Jones**: To determine his symptoms.
5. **Treat Jones**: To ensure he also becomes healthy.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, steroids, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, while also addressing the needs of Jones.
