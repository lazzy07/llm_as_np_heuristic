In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy. Since the jewelry is with Casey (C3) in the same room (R22), Alex can simply trade with Casey to achieve their goal. 

Here’s the story:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex trades the jewelry they want (I1) with Casey for the item Casey has (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation changes as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the jewelry (I1).
- Casey is not happy because they have given away the item they wanted (I3).

This single action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively achieves Alex's goal with the minimum number of actions.
