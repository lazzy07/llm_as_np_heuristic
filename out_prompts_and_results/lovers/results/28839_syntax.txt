To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves from the bedroom (R11) to the bathroom (R12) to be closer to Casey and Blake.
2. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R12) to the dining room (R22) to retrieve the item they want.
3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex follows Casey to the dining room (R22) to see if they can help.
4. **put_down(C2, I3, R22)**: Casey puts down the flowers (I3) in the dining room (R22) to make space for the item they want.
5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R22) to the living room (R21) to check for the jewelry (I2).
6. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bathroom (R12) to check for the chocolates (I1).
7. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I1) in the bathroom (R12), which is the item they want.
8. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R11) to be in a familiar space.
9. **give(C1, I1, C2, R11)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I1) to Casey in the bedroom (R11), making both of them happy.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:
- The first three moves position Alex and Casey in the same room, allowing for interaction.
- Casey puts down the flowers to clear the way for the item they want, which is not directly related to Alex's goal but helps in the overall dynamics.
- Blake's move is to check for their item, which indirectly supports Alex's goal by keeping the flow of items moving.
- Alex's return to the bathroom allows them to pick up the chocolates, which is their desired item.
- Finally, by giving the chocolates to Casey, Alex achieves their goal of happiness, as they now possess the item they wanted.
