Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has a loaded rifle, he decides to shoot Bambi. This action is motivated by his hunger and the desire to have money, as he believes that killing Bambi will provide him with food. 

After shooting Bambi, Bubba can then decide to eat the deer, fulfilling his hunger. Since Bambi is now dead, Bubba can eat the animal, which will satisfy his immediate need for food. 

However, Bubba's ultimate goal is to have money. Since he has not yet acquired any money, he decides to go to the bank to confront the clerk. He can then steal the clerk's money, as he has the loaded rifle, which gives him the power to take what he wants.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Bubba shoots Bambi (to fulfill his hunger).
2. Bubba eats Bambi (to satisfy his hunger).
3. Bubba goes to the bank (to confront the clerk).
4. Bubba steals the clerk's money (to achieve his goal of having money).

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba having the money and Bambi being dead.
