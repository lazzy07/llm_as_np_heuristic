To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) is happy because they have the item they want (I3), but both Alex (C1) and Blake (C2) are not happy. 

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R11)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry. This is a lie, but it will prompt Casey to consider giving it to Alex, as Casey wants Blake to be happy.
   
2. **give(C3, I2, C1, R11)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex. This action is based on Casey's desire to make Blake happy, believing that giving the jewelry to Alex will help.

3. **give(C1, I1, C2, R11)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I1) to Blake. Since Alex wants to make Casey happy and now has the jewelry, they can give the chocolates to Blake, which is what Blake wants.

Now, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Alex is happy because they have the jewelry. Casey is also happy because they have made both Alex and Blake happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **tell(C2, C3, I2, R11)**: This action is necessary to manipulate Casey into thinking that giving the jewelry to Alex will make Blake happy, which aligns with Casey's goal of making Blake happy.
- **give(C3, I2, C1, R11)**: This action directly transfers the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for the jewelry and making them happy.
- **give(C1, I1, C2, R11)**: This action allows Alex to give the chocolates to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire and making them happy.
