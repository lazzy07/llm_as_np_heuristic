**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room A with Jones. To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway decides to assess Jones first.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes that Jones is alive and healthy. 

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones actually has Flaze. Unfortunately, this leads to Jones's demise.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway, realizing the mistake, walks to the admissions room to find Ross and Young, who are still waiting to be assessed.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room C, increasing the workload to 3 again.

5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C, correctly identifying that he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

6. **Walk to Exam Room B**: Hathaway then walks to Exam Room B to assess Young.

7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B and finds that Young has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him.
