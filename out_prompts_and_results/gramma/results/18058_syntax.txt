To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit is at the Crossroads and will move to the Market. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit is not in the way of Tom's goal.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is at the Market and will move to the Crossroads. This action is included to ensure that the Merchant is not in the way of Tom's goal.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard is at the Market and will also move to the Crossroads. This action is included to ensure that the Guard is not in the way of Tom's goal.

5. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk back to the Cottage, now that the other characters have moved away from the Crossroads.

At this point, Tom is at the Cottage carrying the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is crucial as it directly moves Tom to the Cottage where he wants to be.
- The subsequent actions of the Bandit, Merchant, and Guard moving to the Market are necessary to ensure that they do not interfere with Tom's goal. Since Tom is not armed, he needs to avoid any potential conflict with the other characters.
- The final action of Tom walking back to the Cottage confirms that he has successfully reached his destination with the medicine.
