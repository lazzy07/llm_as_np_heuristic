1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to escape the confines of the cell block and strategize his next move.)
   
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to bypass the bully and reach Roy without being threatened.)

3. **Ernest unlocks the gym door.** (This action is crucial as it allows Roy to escape the gym and join Ernest.)

4. **Roy and Ernest both move to the hallway.** (They regroup in the hallway, where they can plan their next steps without the immediate threat of the bully.)

5. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguise is essential for their escape plan, allowing them to blend in outside the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest and Roy is aimed at avoiding the bully's threat and ultimately escaping the prison. Moving to the hallway and crawling through the vents allows them to avoid confrontation. Unlocking the gym door is a strategic move to free Roy from the bully's threat. Putting on civilian clothes is necessary for disguise, and finally, moving to the highway and escaping is the culmination of their efforts to achieve their goal of being alive and free.
