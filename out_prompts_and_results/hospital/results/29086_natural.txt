**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young**: Dr. Hathaway walks into Patient Room B and assesses Young. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the symptoms correctly. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload is still below three, so there is no risk of making a mistake. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young**: Dr. Hathaway decides to treat Young with steroids, assuming it might be Jarkis, as the symptoms are unknown. This is a gamble, but it is the only option available to help Young.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions**: After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to assess Jones.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in the Admissions room. Since Jones is also experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the symptoms correctly again. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, assuming it might be Flaze, as the symptoms are unknown.
