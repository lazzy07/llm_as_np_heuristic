The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the merchant has the medicine, which she can use to further her own goals. The bandit approaches the merchant, who is armed but unaware of the bandit's intentions. 

The bandit, armed with her sword, attacks the merchant. The merchant, not carrying a sword, is unable to defend herself. The bandit successfully kills the merchant and loots the medicine from her corpse. Now, the bandit has the medicine and the hero's coin, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can and having valuable items in her possession.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the Merchant**: The bandit attacks the merchant because she is armed and the merchant is not, allowing her to eliminate a potential threat and take the medicine.
2. **Loot the Medicine**: After killing the merchant, the bandit loots the medicine from the merchant's corpse, which adds to her collection of valuable items.
