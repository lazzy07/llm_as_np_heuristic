Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that to achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, she must first establish a connection with the alien creature. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand in friendship, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' goals of making friends and ensuring safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are in a safer location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, solidifying their newfound friendship and ensuring they are both safe from the volcano. This action reinforces their bond and keeps them out of danger.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe. This event serves as a reminder of the danger they avoided by working together.

By making peace first, Zoe successfully establishes a friendship with the Lizard, ensuring both of them are safe from the volcano's eruption.
