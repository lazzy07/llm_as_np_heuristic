**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, assesses Young in Patient Room B. Due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis instead of Flaze. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the incorrect treatment for Flaze. As a result, Young does not become healthy and is at risk.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to the high workload, Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to reassess Young. This time, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.
