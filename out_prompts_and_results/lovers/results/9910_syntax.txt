To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Casey are located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with them and facilitate the exchange of items.

2. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to create a situation where Casey might be willing to trade or give away the chocolates, which is what Casey believes Blake wants.

3. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. Since Casey wants Blake to be happy, they are likely to comply with Blake's request.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) with the chocolates (I2) in hand. This is necessary for Blake to be in a position to enjoy their item.

5. **put_down(C3, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary to finalize the acquisition of the item and to ensure that Blake can be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex and Casey to interact.
- **tell(C3, C2, I2, R12)**: Blake communicates their desire for the chocolates, influencing Casey's actions.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the living room to enjoy their item.
- **put_down(C3, I2, R22)**: Blake finalizes their happiness by placing the chocolates down.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the item they wanted.
