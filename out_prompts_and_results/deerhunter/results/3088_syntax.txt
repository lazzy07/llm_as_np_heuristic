To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. He has already stolen the rifle from the bank clerk, which means he has the means to intimidate or threaten.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to return to the bank to confront the clerk and demand money. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only character with money, and Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with him.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to shoot the clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and the only way to ensure he gets it is to eliminate the clerk.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, as he is hungry. This action is included to show that Bubba is also addressing his hunger after achieving his goal of getting money.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, the deer, which is a natural consequence of his hunger and the situation in the forest. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking advantage of the resources available to him.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to confront the clerk.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba eliminates the clerk to take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Bubba collects the money, achieving his goal.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba satisfies his hunger by eating Bambi.
