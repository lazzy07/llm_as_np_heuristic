To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The clerk has money but is at the bank, and Bubba has the rifle loaded with ammunition.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is taken because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This aligns with his goal of satisfying his hunger and potentially gaining something from the situation.
  
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot Bambi, which will result in Bambi being dead. This action directly leads to Bambi's demise, fulfilling one of the conditions for the ending.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat her, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to feel fulfilled and is a logical next step after killing Bambi.

4. **Bubba has the option to take money from Bambi.** - Although Bambi does not have money, this action is included to show that Bubba is now in a position to take advantage of the situation, even if it doesn't directly lead to him having money.

5. **Bubba goes back to the bank.** - This action is included to show that Bubba is now ready to confront the clerk and potentially take the money from him.

6. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has the rifle loaded, he can threaten the clerk and take the money. This action fulfills the condition of Bubba having money.

The final outcome is that Bubba has the money, and Bambi is dead, satisfying the requirements of the story.

Here’s the explanation of the actions:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba's hunger drives him to consider killing Bambi for food.
- **Shoot Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** Satisfies Bubba's hunger after killing Bambi.
- **Go back to the bank:** Prepares Bubba to confront the clerk for money.
- **Steal money from the clerk:** This action ensures Bubba ends up with the money he desires.
