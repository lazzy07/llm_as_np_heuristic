Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Upon observing the rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Jarkis. Since Jarkis requires steroids for treatment, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully making him healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross, who is still waiting. Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B and prepares to assess him in the next step.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine the correct disease affecting Jones. Since Jones is showing a rash, it indicates he has Jarkis.
