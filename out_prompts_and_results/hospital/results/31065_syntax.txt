To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess or treat a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to first reduce the workload by treating one patient correctly, which will allow Hathaway to assess the remaining patients without the risk of error.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in PatientRoomB. Since Young is already in the room, this action is necessary to determine their symptoms. 
2. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure Young becomes healthy.
3. **Walk to PatientRoomA**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomA to assess Ross.
4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA to determine their symptoms.
5. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.
