**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest decides to take action to ensure both his and Roy's safety. He knows that the bully is a threat, especially now that Roy has stolen the cigarettes. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to access the gym where the bully is located.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest prevents the bully from coming out and threatening them further.)
3. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the kitchen.** (This action allows Ernest to retrieve the knife without being seen by the bully.)
4. **Ernest takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for Ernest to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
5. **Ernest crawls back through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to confront the bully directly.)
6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat to both him and Roy, ensuring their safety.)

With the bully dead, Ernest and Roy can now breathe a sigh of relief. They can plan their escape together on the next day.
