To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants to get money. The only way to achieve this is to return to the bank and steal the money from the bank clerk, as he believes the clerk has money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary to reach the location where the money is.

3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads his rifle again. This action is necessary to ensure he is prepared to threaten the bank clerk if needed.

4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk while threatening him with the loaded rifle. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and his goal to acquire money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location of the money.
3. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Prepares Bubba to threaten the clerk.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
