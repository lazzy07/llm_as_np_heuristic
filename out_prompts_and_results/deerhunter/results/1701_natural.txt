To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the power to take action against the clerk or Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **Going to the bank:** This is essential for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to take the money.
- **Shooting the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only character with money, thus making it possible for Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
