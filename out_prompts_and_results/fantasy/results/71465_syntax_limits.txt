After the events that have transpired, Rory is in the Village, and Talia is in the Cave with the Treasure. To achieve Rory's goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory will travel to the Cave to be with Talia, who has proposed to him and accepted his proposal. This action is necessary for Rory to be with Talia and to potentially access the Treasure.

2. **Pickup Treasure**: Once Rory arrives at the Cave, he will pick up the Treasure. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of his primary goals.

By taking these two actions, Rory will achieve his goal of being happy (due to his relationship with Talia), wealthy (by acquiring the Treasure), and not hungry (as he is not currently hungry).

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Travel**: This action allows Rory to move to the Cave where Talia is, ensuring they can be together and solidify their relationship.
