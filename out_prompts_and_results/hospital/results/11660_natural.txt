**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, this treatment is a gamble. However, it is the only option available to Hathaway at this moment.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload reduces to 1. Jones, after receiving treatment, becomes healthy, as he was indeed suffering from Flaze.

Now, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross and Young. Since both are still in Admissions, Hathaway can assess them one by one. 

First, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze as well. Ross becomes healthy after the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing Unknown. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Young becomes healthy after the treatment.

With all patients treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
