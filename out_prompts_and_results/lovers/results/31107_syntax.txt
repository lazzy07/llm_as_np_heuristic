To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, we need to ensure that Casey is also happy, as Alex wants Casey to be happy. The only way for Casey to be happy is to have the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)**: Alex (C1) trades the flowers (I1) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I3) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

2. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey (C3) gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2). This action is necessary because Blake wants the jewelry, and by giving it to Blake, it ensures that Blake is happy.

3. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake (C2) gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3). This action is necessary because it fulfills Casey's desire for the chocolates, making Casey happy.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the flowers (I1), Casey is happy because they have the chocolates (I2), and Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I3). 

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Alex trades flowers for jewelry with Casey.
2. Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.
3. Blake gives chocolates to Casey.

This sequence of actions ensures that all characters achieve their happiness, but primarily focuses on Alex's goal of making Casey happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C1, I1, C3, I3, R22)",
    "give(C3, I3, C2, R22)",
    "give(C2, I2, C3, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by making sure Casey is happy, which is the ultimate aim of the story.
