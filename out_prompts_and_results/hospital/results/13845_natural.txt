**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (fever) instead of Jarkis (rash). 

2. **Treat Young for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment for Flaze. However, since Young actually has Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess the remaining patients, Jones and Ross.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A, increasing her workload again.

5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze.

6. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross has Jarkis. Ross dies.

7. **Admit Jones to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C, increasing her workload once more.

8. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. She mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze.

9. **Treat Jones for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Jones has Jarkis. Jones dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although well-intentioned, lead to the deaths of all patients due to her misdiagnosis caused by her high workload. However, she has completed her goal of assessing and treating all patients, albeit with tragic outcomes.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young, Ross, and Jones was necessary to determine their symptoms, even though the high workload led to misdiagnosis.
- Treating each patient was essential to attempt to make them healthy, despite the incorrect treatments leading to their demise.
- Walking to Admissions and admitting patients was necessary to manage the flow of patients and ensure they were seen.
