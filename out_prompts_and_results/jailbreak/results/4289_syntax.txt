**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the kitchen, Ernest and Roy are both aware of the threat posed by the bully, who is currently in the gym. Roy, having stolen the pack of cigarettes earlier, knows that the bully will be looking for them. To ensure their safety and to escape the prison, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Disguise (Roy, Clothes, Kitchen)**: Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This disguise will help him blend in and avoid detection when he attempts to escape.

2. **Go (Roy, Hall)**: After disguising himself, Roy moves to the hallway. This is a strategic move to get closer to the exit.

3. **Vent (Roy, Highway)**: From the hallway, Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway. This action allows him to bypass the main prison areas where he could be caught.

4. **Escape (Roy, Highway)**: Once on the highway, Roy takes advantage of his disguise to escape from the prison. This is the ultimate goal he wanted to achieve: to be alive and free.
