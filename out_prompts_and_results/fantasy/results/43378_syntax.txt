To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has proposed to both Vince and Rory, and Rory has accepted Talia's proposal, they can get married, which will make Talia happy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Since Rory has accepted Talia's proposal, they can get married. This action will make Talia happy, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **Marrying Rory**: This is the only action that directly leads to Talia's happiness. Since she has already proposed to Rory and he accepted, the marriage solidifies their relationship and fulfills Talia's goal of being happy.

After this action, Talia will be happy, and we have achieved the goal of the story.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
