To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the market where she can interact with the hero and the guard, and potentially sell items or acquire coins.

2. **The merchant sells the medicine to the hero for the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain a coin while providing the hero with the medicine he desires. The merchant is not committing a crime, as she is selling the item legitimately.

3. **The merchant walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to move to a location where she can potentially interact with other characters or prepare for future transactions.

At this point, the merchant has successfully acquired a coin from the hero through a legitimate sale, achieving her goal without engaging in criminal activity.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action places the merchant in a location where she can conduct business.
- The second action directly fulfills the merchant's goal of acquiring coins while maintaining her status as a non-criminal.
- The third action allows the merchant to leave the market, potentially avoiding any unwanted attention from the guard or the bandit.
