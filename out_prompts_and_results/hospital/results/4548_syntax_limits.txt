In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in the hospital admissions room and has already admitted Jones and Young to their respective exam rooms. Jones is in exam room A, and Young is in exam room C. Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, which means that if she assesses another patient, she risks making a mistake. 

To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to treat Jones and Young correctly. Since Jones is already in exam room A, Hathaway will assess him first to confirm his symptoms. After assessing Jones, she will treat him with the appropriate antibiotics for Flaze, as he is showing symptoms of that disease. Then, she will walk to exam room C to assess Young, who is also showing symptoms. After assessing Young, she will treat him with steroids for Jarkis, ensuring both patients are healthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in exam room A to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure she treats him correctly.
2. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics for Flaze, which is the correct treatment for his symptoms. This action is crucial for Jones's recovery.
3. **Walk to Exam Room C**: Hathaway walks to exam room C to assess Young. This is necessary to check Young's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in exam room C to confirm his symptoms. This is essential to ensure he receives the correct treatment.
5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids for Jarkis, which is the correct treatment for his symptoms. This action ensures Young's recovery.

By following this sequence, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
