Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing and treating the patients in the admissions room. She first admits Ross to Patient Room A, where she can assess him. This action increases her workload to 4, but she believes it is necessary to ensure all patients are healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since she is at maximum workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze instead of Jarkis. She treats him with antibiotics, which is incorrect for his actual condition. Unfortunately, this leads to Ross's demise.

Afterward, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. She assesses Jones, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, resulting in his death as well.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. She assesses Young and, due to her workload, mistakenly believes he has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, leading to his demise as well.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, although well-intentioned, result in the deaths of all patients due to her mistakes caused by her high workload. However, she remains committed to her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, even if the outcome was tragic.
