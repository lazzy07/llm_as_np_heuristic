To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave where the treasure is located, and she has just accepted a marriage proposal from Vince. However, she is not happy yet, and she has no wealth. 

The following actions will be taken to achieve Talia's goal:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and picking it up will increase Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.
2. **Gargax eats Talia.** Gargax is hungry and will eat Talia, which will result in Talia's death. However, since Talia has already achieved her goal of becoming wealthy by picking up the treasure, this action will not affect her wealth status.
3. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's dead body.** Gargax, now wealthy after taking the treasure, fulfills his goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.** - This action makes Talia wealthy, achieving one of her goals.
2. **Gargax eats Talia.** - This action does not affect Talia's wealth status but fulfills Gargax's hunger.
3. **Gargax takes the treasure from Talia's dead body.** - This action makes Gargax wealthy, fulfilling his goal.

At the end of these actions, Talia is wealthy, which satisfies her goal of becoming wealthy.
