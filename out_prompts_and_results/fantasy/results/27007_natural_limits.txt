In this story, Gargax's goal is to become wealthy and not hungry. To achieve this, Gargax needs to acquire the money that Vince has, as it is the only item that can help him achieve wealth. Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money from Vince's body.

Here’s the completed story:

1. Gargax travels from the village to the village (this action is redundant but necessary to establish Gargax's presence at the location where Vince's body is).
2. Gargax takes the money from Vince's body.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is technically unnecessary since Gargax is already at the village, but it serves to confirm that Gargax is present at the location where the money is located.
- The second action is crucial as it allows Gargax to take the money from Vince, thus achieving his goal of becoming wealthy.

After these actions, Gargax will have the money, fulfilling his desire for wealth and ensuring he is not hungry.
