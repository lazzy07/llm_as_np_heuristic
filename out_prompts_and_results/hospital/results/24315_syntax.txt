To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Jones: to provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Young based on assessment**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms observed. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
