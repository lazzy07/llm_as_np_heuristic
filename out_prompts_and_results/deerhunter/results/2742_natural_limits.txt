Bubba, feeling hungry after his earlier actions, decides to eat Bambi, who is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain energy. However, it does not directly help him achieve his goal of obtaining money. To achieve his goal, Bubba then decides to go back to the bank, where he can confront the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

1. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is a basic need for survival.
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

After these actions, Bubba can confront the clerk at the bank, where he can attempt to steal the money he desires.

```json
