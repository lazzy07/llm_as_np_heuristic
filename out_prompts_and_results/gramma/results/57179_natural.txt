To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to be at the market where she can interact with the hero and the guard.

2. **The merchant sells the medicine to the hero for a coin.**  
   - The merchant needs to sell the medicine to gain a coin, which is part of her goal to acquire coins without resorting to criminal activity.

3. **The guard reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - This action is not necessary for the merchant's goal but helps maintain the narrative that the guard is vigilant against crime, reinforcing the merchant's non-criminal status.

4. **The guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is not directly related to the merchant's goal but helps to clear the market of any potential threats, allowing the merchant to operate freely.

5. **The hero walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for the hero to return to the cottage with the medicine, which is not directly related to the merchant's goal but helps to conclude the story.

6. **The guard walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for the guard to confront the bandit camp, ensuring that the market remains safe and allowing the merchant to continue her business.

In summary, the merchant successfully sells the medicine to the hero for a coin, achieving her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. The other actions help to maintain the story's flow and ensure the market remains safe.
