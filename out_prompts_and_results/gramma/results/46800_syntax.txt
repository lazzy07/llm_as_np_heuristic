To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom at the Crossroads to take the coins Tom is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp and take the coins from the chest. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has the maximum amount of coins possible.

The Bandit will not need to engage with the Merchant or the Guard since her goal is to accumulate coins, and she can achieve this by robbing Tom and taking the coins from her own chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. The Bandit sees Tom at the Crossroads and decides to rob him. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit successfully takes the coins he is carrying.
2. With the coins from Tom, the Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp and takes the coins from the chest, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as possible.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal through these two actions.
