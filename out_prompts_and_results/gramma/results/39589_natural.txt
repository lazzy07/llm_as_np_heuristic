To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom uses the medicine.**  
   - This action is included to fulfill Tom's goal of carrying the medicine, as he has successfully reached the cottage.

The story is very straightforward because Tom's goal is simply to reach the cottage with the medicine he has already acquired. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, and since he is not armed, he does not engage in any conflict.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.",
    "Tom uses the medicine."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Tom achieves his goal efficiently and without unnecessary complications.
