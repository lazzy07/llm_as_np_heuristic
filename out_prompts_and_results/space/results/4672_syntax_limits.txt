Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the tension in the air as she looks at the Lizard, the guardian of this world. They have just made peace, but the surface is still dangerous. To ensure both of them are safe and to foster their newfound friendship, Zoe decides to take action.

**Action:** teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)

**Explanation:** By teleporting back to the spaceship, Zoe ensures her safety from the dangers of the surface, including the potential eruption of the volcano. This action also allows her to maintain a safe distance while still being able to communicate with the Lizard, which is essential for building their friendship. Since they are no longer fighting and have made peace, Zoe can focus on her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends.
