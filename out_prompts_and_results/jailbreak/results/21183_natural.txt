**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that the bully is still in the gym and that Ernest is in the kitchen with the cigarettes. Knowing that the bully is a threat to both of them, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to access the gym without being seen by the bully, as the gym door is locked.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door behind him.** (This ensures that the bully cannot escape and that Roy can confront him without fear of being interrupted.)
3. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to defend himself and to eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)
4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action removes the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)
5. **Roy crawls back through the vents to the hallway.** (This allows Roy to return to safety without being seen.)
6. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him further, ensuring he can escape without being recognized.)
7. **Roy goes to the highway.** (This is the final step to reach freedom.)
8. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (This action fulfills Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure Roy can eliminate the bully, who poses a direct threat to both him and Ernest.
