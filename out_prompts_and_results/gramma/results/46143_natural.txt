The bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit already has coins in the chest, she can take actions to ensure she has more coins. The following actions will help the bandit achieve her goal:

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. 
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where her coins are stored.

2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp to access the coins in the chest.
2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest, fulfilling her goal of having coins.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.",
    "The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins.
