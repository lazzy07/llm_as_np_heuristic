**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, feeling threatened by the bully. Meanwhile, Roy is in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes he stole from the laundry. Knowing that the bully is in the cell block and feeling the urgency to escape, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Action: disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)** - Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself, which is essential for his escape plan. This action is necessary because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.

2. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)** - After disguising himself, Roy moves to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison. This action is the culmination of his efforts to achieve his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of disguising himself is crucial because without the civilian clothes, Roy would be easily identified as a prisoner and would not be able to escape. 
- The second action of escaping is the ultimate goal for Roy, allowing him to leave the prison and ensure his survival.
