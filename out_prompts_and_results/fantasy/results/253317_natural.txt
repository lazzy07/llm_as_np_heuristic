To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Vince to leave the cave where he has the money and come to the village where Talia and Rory are. It sets up the next actions.

2. **Gargax eats Vince.**  
   - Gargax, who is at the cave, is hungry and wants to eat a human. By eating Vince, Gargax eliminates a competitor for wealth and allows Rory to take the money without any opposition.

3. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Rory needs to go to the cave to retrieve the money that Vince had. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

4. **Rory takes the money from Vince's dead body.**  
   - Since Vince is dead, Rory can take the money that Vince had. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

5. **Rory travels back to the village.**  
   - After acquiring the money, Rory returns to the village where Talia is, which is necessary for Rory to achieve happiness through companionship.

6. **Rory and Talia become happy.**  
   - Since Rory is now wealthy and has Talia, he achieves happiness.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Rory can become wealthy by taking the money from Vince after Gargax eats him, and then he returns to Talia to achieve happiness.
