The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the hero is present. The bandit then robs the hero, taking the medicine that the hero is carrying. This action is possible because the hero is not armed with a sword at this moment, making them vulnerable to robbery. With the medicine in hand, the bandit now has a valuable item that she can use to trade or leverage for coins later.
