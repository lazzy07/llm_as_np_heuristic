Zoe, the space explorer, realizes that the Lizard is in danger on the surface of the planet due to the erupting volcano. Understanding that her goal is to make friends with the Lizard and ensure both of their safety, she decides to teleport down to the surface to help.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to be closer to the Lizard and offer assistance. This action is necessary for her to engage with the Lizard directly.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes peace with it. This action is crucial as it establishes a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks with the Lizard to the cave, where they can find shelter from the volcanic eruption. This action ensures both characters are safe and allows them to bond further.

By taking these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring their safety from the erupting volcano.
