Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger from the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have just become friends. To achieve their goals, they need to find a safe place away from the surface.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the erupting volcano. Teleporting to the spaceship provides her with a safe environment.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface to help the Lizard, as she wants to make friends and ensure the Lizard's safety as well. 

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - They both need to find shelter from the erupting volcano. The cave is a safe location where they can avoid the danger of the surface.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave until the eruption is over.** - This action is implied as they wait for the volcano to finish erupting, ensuring both characters remain safe and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
