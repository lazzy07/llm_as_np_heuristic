To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he may need to threaten the bank clerk to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene and avoid any potential consequences.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, indicating that he is still hungry after his actions. This is a natural progression for his character, as he has not eaten yet.

5. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba returns to the bank, which may seem counterintuitive, but it allows him to ensure he has everything he needs and possibly check on the clerk.

6. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba goes back to the forest again, solidifying his escape and ensuring he is away from the bank.

7. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, which fulfills his hunger and ties up the story by showing that he has taken action to sustain himself after his greedy actions.

The actions taken are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
