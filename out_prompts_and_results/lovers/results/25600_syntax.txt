To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I3) they want with Alex (C1) for the flowers (I1) that Alex has. This action is necessary because Casey needs to give Alex something in return to obtain the jewelry.

2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake (C2) moves to the dining room (R12) to pick up the chocolates (I2). This action is not directly related to Casey's goal but helps Blake to eventually achieve their own happiness.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to be with Blake. This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to facilitate further actions.

4. **give(C3, I3, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial as it allows Casey to fulfill their goal of making Blake happy, which in turn aligns with Casey's own happiness.

5. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey (C3). This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their own happiness, as they want to make Casey happy.

After these actions, Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
