To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess a patient. However, since Hathaway has already assessed Ross and knows he has SymptomB, they can treat him correctly. The next step is to assess and treat the other patients, Jones and Young, to ensure they are also healthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway has already assessed Ross and knows he has SymptomB. This action is already completed.
2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross for SymptomB, which is the correct treatment for Flaze (since SymptomB is a fever). This will make Ross healthy.
3. **Walk Hathaway to Admissions**: Hathaway needs to go to the admissions room to assess Jones and Young.
4. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient left unassessed, this is necessary.
5. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms found. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis.
6. **Walk Hathaway to Exam Room C**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room C to assess Young.
7. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms.
8. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats him based on the symptoms found.

By following this sequence, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics or steroids, Admissions)",
    "walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics or steroids, PatientRoomC)"
  ]
}
```
