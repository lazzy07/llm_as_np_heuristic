To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from the dining room. This action is essential for Casey to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This is important for Casey to share their happiness with the others.

4. **tell(C3, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey tells Alex that they have the jewelry. This action is included to communicate their success in obtaining what they wanted.

5. **tell(C3, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they have the jewelry. This reinforces the communication of their happiness to both friends.
