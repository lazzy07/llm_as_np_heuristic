To complete the story while ensuring the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, we need to focus on the actions that will allow her to do so. Given the current situation, the Merchant is in the Market with the Bandit, who has just attacked Tom. The Merchant can take advantage of the situation to rob the Bandit, as the Bandit is armed and the Merchant is also armed.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the Merchant achieving her goal:

1. **rob(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant can rob the Bandit, taking the coins the Bandit has. This action is necessary because it allows the Merchant to acquire coins without becoming a criminal, as she is not attacking or killing anyone.

2. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing the Bandit, the Merchant can walk to the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move away from the Market and avoid any potential confrontation with the Guard, who is also present.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, the Merchant can walk to the Cottage. This action is necessary to reach a safe location where she can keep her coins without the threat of being attacked or reported.

By following these actions, the Merchant successfully acquires coins and moves to a safe location, achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the Bandit**: This is the key action that allows the Merchant to gain coins without committing a crime that would attract the Guard's attention.
- **Walking to the Crossroads**: This action helps the Merchant to distance herself from the Bandit and the Guard, ensuring her safety.
- **Walking to the Cottage**: This final action secures her position and allows her to keep the coins she has acquired.
