To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomB, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will then assess Ross in PatientRoomA. This is important to ensure that both patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Ross also becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients effectively, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
