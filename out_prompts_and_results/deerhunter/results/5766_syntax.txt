To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money. Since the bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, Bubba can go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and continue with his plans.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary to confront the clerk and attempt to steal money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals money from the clerk while holding the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to be more focused and capable of further actions.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money from the clerk.
