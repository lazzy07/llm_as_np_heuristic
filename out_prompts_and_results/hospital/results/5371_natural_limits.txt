Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A with Ross. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Ross. However, with a workload of 3, there is a risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a chance of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to gather information.

2. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Assuming that Ross has Flaze (due to the fever symptom), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy. If not, he will die. This action is crucial for Ross's health.

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room, allowing for future assessment and treatment.

4. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Jones. This action is necessary to check on Jones's condition and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the final step to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Jones are assessed and treated, ultimately achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
