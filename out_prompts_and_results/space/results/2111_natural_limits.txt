Zoe, realizing the danger of the surface and wanting to ensure her safety, decides to teleport back to her spaceship. This action, while it makes the Lizard angry, is necessary for her immediate safety. However, the Lizard, feeling threatened by Zoe's repeated teleportation, decides to walk from the cave to the surface to confront her. 

Upon arriving at the surface, the Lizard sees Zoe and understands that she is not a threat but rather a fellow creature seeking safety. The Lizard approaches Zoe and, instead of fighting, extends a hand of friendship.
