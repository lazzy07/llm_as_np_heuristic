To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Blake.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey currently has the flowers, which Alex wants. By giving the flowers to Blake, Casey can create a situation where Blake can potentially trade or give the chocolates to Alex, which will help align their goals.

2. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.**  
   - Blake wants the chocolates, and since Casey has just given the flowers to Blake, this action allows Blake to fulfill their desire while also keeping Alex happy, as Alex now has the flowers.

3. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.**  
   - Since Alex is now happy with the flowers and Blake has the chocolates, Alex can afford to give the jewelry to Casey, allowing Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions in the story:

- Casey gives the flowers to Blake.
- Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.
- Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.
