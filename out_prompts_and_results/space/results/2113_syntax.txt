Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, where she has just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. The surface is currently dangerous, and Zoe needs to ensure her safety while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again in the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that they are both on the same side, which is crucial for their mutual goals of safety and health.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface with Zoe. This action keeps them together and allows them to explore the surface together, further strengthening their bond.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard notice the volcano starting to erupt. This action is critical as it introduces a new element of danger that they must address together.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard quickly walk back to the cave to avoid the eruption. This action is necessary for their safety, as the cave provides shelter from the volcanic eruption.

6. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but Zoe and the Lizard are safe in the cave. This action concludes the immediate danger on the surface and allows them to focus on their friendship.

7. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Finally, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship in the cave, ensuring that they are both committed to being allies and friends moving forward.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
