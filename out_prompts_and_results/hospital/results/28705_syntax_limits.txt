To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Jones is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Assess(Jones)**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomB and assesses Jones. This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify the symptoms Jones is exhibiting, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat(Jones, antibiotics)**: After assessing Jones, if he is found to have a fever (indicating Flaze), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is essential as it directly leads to Jones becoming healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway successfully diagnoses and treats Jones, ensuring he is healthy.
