To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money. Since the bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, Bubba can go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary to confront the clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal money from the clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have satisfied his hunger and successfully stolen money from the clerk, fulfilling his greedy desires.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to regain energy.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
