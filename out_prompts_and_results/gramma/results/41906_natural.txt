To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can store her coins in the chest.

2. **The bandit loots the coin from the chest.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to collect the coins she has stored, thus achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The story is short because the bandit only needs to return to her camp to access her coins, and there are no other characters that can interfere with her actions at this point.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary for the bandit to return to her base of operations, where she can safely access her coins without the risk of being attacked or robbed.
- The second action is crucial as it directly fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
