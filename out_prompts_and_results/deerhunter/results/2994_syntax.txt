To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, has a rifle, and is hungry. The bank clerk is also at the bank and is alive. Bubba has already stolen the rifle from the clerk, which gives him power over the situation.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba is hungry, and he needs to eat. This action is necessary for him to satisfy his hunger.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Bank)**: Bubba can eat Bambi, who is dead, to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary for Bubba to regain energy and continue with his plans.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After eating, Bubba can reaffirm his desire for money, which is his ultimate goal.
4. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has already stolen the rifle, he can now threaten the clerk to give him the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money from the clerk.
5. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If the clerk does not comply, Bubba can shoot him to ensure he gets the money. This action is necessary to eliminate any resistance from the clerk.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba needs to eat to regain energy.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Bank)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba reaffirms his goal of obtaining money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to threaten the clerk for money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: If necessary, Bubba shoots the clerk to ensure he gets the money.

This sequence of actions leads to Bubba achieving his goal of obtaining money.
