To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard continue to build their friendship while also ensuring that the volcano erupts, leading to a character's death. The goal is to create a scenario where they can become friends, but the eruption will ultimately lead to one of them dying.

1. **Zoe and Lizard make peace**: Since they are already in a non-fighting state and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is necessary to ensure that they are friends before the volcano erupts.
   
2. **Begin eruption**: The volcano on the surface is already in a dangerous state, and we will initiate the eruption. This action is crucial to set the stage for the impending danger.

3. **Erupt**: After beginning the eruption, we will have the volcano erupt. This action will lead to the death of one of the characters.

4. **Kill**: Since Zoe is on the surface and the volcano erupts, she will die as a result of the eruption. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying.

The final sequence of actions will ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends, while also leading to Zoe's death due to the volcanic eruption.
