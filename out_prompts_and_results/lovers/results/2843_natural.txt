To ensure Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the bedroom to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to go to the dining room to pick up the chocolates, which are currently located there.

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to acquire the item they want, which is essential for their happiness.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's goal but allows for potential interactions with other characters if needed.

4. **Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - This action is also not strictly necessary for Blake's goal but allows for potential interactions with Casey, who is currently in the bathroom.

5. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the bedroom.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Blake's goal but allows for a final interaction with Alex, who is in the bedroom.

6. **Blake tells Alex that the chocolates are in the dining room.**  
   - This action is a lie, as Blake has already picked up the chocolates. However, it reinforces the belief that the chocolates are still in the dining room, which may affect Alex's actions later.

7. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Blake's happiness but could potentially make Alex happy if they believe they want the chocolates.

After these actions, Blake has achieved their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions are crucial for Blake to obtain the chocolates.
- The subsequent movements to the living room and bathroom are not necessary for achieving Blake's goal but allow for potential interactions with other characters.
- The final actions of telling Alex about the chocolates and giving them to Alex are included to show the dynamics of the characters' beliefs and interactions, even if they do not directly contribute to Blake's happiness.
