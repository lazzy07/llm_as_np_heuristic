Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Young and confirms that Young is experiencing Fever, which indicates the presence of Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, they can treat Young without making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics to Young, successfully treating the disease. Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting there. Dr. Hathaway assigns Jones to Exam Room B, increasing their workload to 3. However, since Dr. Hathaway has already treated Young correctly, they are now focused on helping Jones.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway cannot determine the disease. However, since Jones is alive and healthy, Dr. Hathaway can still provide care and monitor Jones for any changes.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Assess Young to confirm Fever (necessary to identify the disease).
2. Treat Young with antibiotics (necessary to achieve health).
3. Admit Jones to Exam Room B (necessary to provide care).
