To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard will walk from the Cave to the Surface. This action is necessary because the Lizard needs to be on the same location as Zoe to interact with her and potentially make peace.

2. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Once the Lizard is on the Surface, it will attempt to make peace with Zoe. This action is crucial for establishing a friendly relationship, which is one of the Lizard's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the Cave with the Lizard. This action signifies their newfound friendship and allows them to explore the Cave together, ensuring both characters are safe from the erupting volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the Cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action emphasizes the danger of the Surface and reinforces the importance of their friendship and cooperation.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
