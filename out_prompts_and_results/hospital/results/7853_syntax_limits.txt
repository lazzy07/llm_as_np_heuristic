Hathaway, the doctor, is in the admissions room with three patients: Young, Jones, and Ross. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can still assess and treat patients without the risk of making a mistake.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary to identify his condition.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway assesses Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This ensures that all patients are evaluated before treatment.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing all patients, Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to prepare for treatment.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: Assuming Ross has Jarkis (as he shows a rash), Hathaway treats him with steroids in Exam Room C. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Ross, achieving their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient**: This is crucial to determine the correct treatment for each patient based on their symptoms.
- **Admitting Ross**: This prepares him for treatment, ensuring he is in the right location for the doctor to administer care.
- **Treating Ross**: This is the final action that directly leads to the goal of making a patient healthy.
