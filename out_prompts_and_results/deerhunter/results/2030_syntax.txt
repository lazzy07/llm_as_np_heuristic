To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money, and he is currently at the bank where the clerk has money. Since Bubba is greedy and hungry, he will take actions that align with his desire for money while also considering his hunger.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to take the clerk's money directly.

2. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: After stealing the money, Bubba realizes he is still hungry. This action is necessary for Bubba to acknowledge his hunger and decide to eat.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary because Bubba needs to find food to satisfy his hunger.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba will shoot Bambi, which allows him to obtain food. This action is necessary for Bubba to fulfill his hunger after stealing the money.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi. This action is necessary to satisfy his hunger after having killed Bambi.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba takes the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba acknowledges his hunger after acquiring money.
- **go**: Bubba moves to the forest to find food.
- **shoot**: Bubba kills Bambi to obtain food.
- **eat**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
