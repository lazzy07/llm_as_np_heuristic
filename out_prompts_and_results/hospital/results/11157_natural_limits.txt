Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Jones is alive and healthy. After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway then treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect since Jones actually has an unknown condition. However, since Jones is alive, he survives the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Ross and Young. Hathaway assesses Ross first, who is still in Admissions. After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross has an unknown condition. However, since Ross is alive, he survives the treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions. After assessing, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis due to the high workload. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is incorrect since Young has an unknown condition. However, since Young is alive, he survives the treatment.

In the end, all patients are alive, and Dr. Hathaway has treated them, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
