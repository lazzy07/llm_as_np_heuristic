To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire the treasure while also ensuring he is not hungry. Here’s the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village to be closer to Talia, who has accepted his proposal. This action is necessary for Rory to be with Talia and potentially increase his happiness.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia in the Village. This action makes both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's desire for happiness.

3. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the Cave to retrieve the treasure. This is necessary for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.

4. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the Cave. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

5. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory returns to the Village with the treasure. This is necessary for him to be in a safe place with Talia.

6. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Rory is now in a state where he needs to address his hunger.

7. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to show the consequence of Rory's actions, but it does not affect his goals since he has already achieved happiness and wealth before this point.

At the end of these actions, Rory has achieved his goals of happiness (through marriage) and wealth (by acquiring the treasure). The story ends with Rory's demise, but his goals are fulfilled before that.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "marry(Rory, Talia, Village)",
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)",
    "travel(Rory, Cave, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Rory)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan outlines the necessary actions taken by Rory to achieve his goals of happiness and wealth, even if it leads to his eventual demise.
