To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares Bubba to either threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi, depending on his next move.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed and achieving the goal of having the money.

This sequence of actions is efficient and directly leads to the desired outcome. The first action ensures Bubba is armed, and the second action allows him to eliminate the clerk and take the money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

In this story, Bubba successfully becomes greedy and takes the money from the bank clerk by using the rifle, thus achieving his goal. Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is accomplished.
