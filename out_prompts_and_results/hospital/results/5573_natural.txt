**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is currently at Patient Room A. Ross, Jones, and Young are all at Admissions, but they are experiencing unknown symptoms. To ensure that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients in Admissions, including Ross, who is currently experiencing unknown symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.**  
   - By assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can determine his symptoms. Since Ross is alive and healthy, this assessment will reveal that he is experiencing symptoms of Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). However, due to Dr. Hathaway's workload being 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze due to the high workload, he administers antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy. If he has Jarkis, he will die. However, for the purpose of this story, we will assume Ross has Flaze.

4. **Ross becomes healthy.**  
   - This is the desired outcome for Ross, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure that Ross is assessed and treated. The first action allows Dr. Hathaway to reach Ross, the second action is crucial for determining Ross's condition, and the third action is the treatment that leads to Ross's recovery. The assumption of misdiagnosis is a necessary plot point due to the workload, but ultimately, Ross's health is prioritized.
