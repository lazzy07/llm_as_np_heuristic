To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Tom, TomCoin, Bandit, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coin he has just acquired from the Merchant. This action is possible because Tom is not carrying a sword, making him vulnerable to robbery. After this action, the Bandit will have one coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her newly acquired coin in the chest. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her loot.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coin from the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has the maximum amount of coins possible.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins, as she successfully robs Tom and then secures the coins in her camp.
