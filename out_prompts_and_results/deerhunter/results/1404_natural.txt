To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen from the clerk. He is hungry and wants to have money. The clerk has no money and is alive, while Bambi is in the forest and is also alive.

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential threat and has no money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can ensure that he can take the money without any opposition.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** This action directly leads to the clerk's death, allowing Bubba to take the money without any risk of being stopped.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of having money, and Bambi remains alive, which is acceptable as the primary goal was for Bubba to have the money.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Shoot the clerk:** This action eliminates the threat and allows Bubba to take the money.
- **Pick up the money from the clerk:** This final action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.
