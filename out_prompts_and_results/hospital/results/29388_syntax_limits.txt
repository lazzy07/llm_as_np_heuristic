In this story, we want to ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we need to take actions that will allow Hathaway to assess and treat Jones effectively.

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will proceed with the assessment to identify Jones's condition.

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, assuming that Jones has Flaze (the only disease that can be treated with antibiotics). This action is crucial because it directly addresses Jones's health condition.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones**: This action is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis. Since we want Jones to be healthy, we need to know the correct treatment.
- **Treating Jones with Antibiotics**: This action is essential because it provides the necessary treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.
