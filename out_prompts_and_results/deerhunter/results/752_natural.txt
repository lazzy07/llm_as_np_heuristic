Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of obtaining money, he decides to steal from the bank clerk, who has the money he desires. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to take the clerk's money, and since he has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate any resistance.
2. **Bubba eats the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba is hungry. He decides to eat the clerk, which satisfies his hunger and allows him to consume the body.
3. **Bubba picks up the money.** - After the clerk is dead, Bubba can take the money from the clerk's possession, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba shoots the clerk.",
    "Bubba eats the clerk.",
    "Bubba picks up the money."
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's desires: to have money and to satisfy his hunger.
