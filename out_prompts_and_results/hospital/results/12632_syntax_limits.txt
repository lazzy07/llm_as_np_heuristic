In this story, we want to ensure that Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we need to take actions that will lead to Ross being treated correctly for their symptoms.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing Ross's symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will proceed with the assessment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will make him healthy. If he has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. The goal is to ensure that Ross receives the correct treatment.

3. **Walk Ross to Admissions**: After being treated, Ross will walk to the Admissions room to confirm his health status and ensure he is accounted for as a healthy patient.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

- **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for providing the right treatment.
- **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment. If the treatment is correct, Ross becomes healthy.
- **Walk Ross to Admissions**: Ross walks to the Admissions room to finalize his status as a healthy patient.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Ross, PatientRoomC, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Ross is assessed, treated correctly, and confirmed as healthy, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
