Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is too high and that they need to assess the patients to determine their symptoms, decides to take action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in Admissions, as they need to determine their symptoms to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.** By admitting Young to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess Young's symptoms and provide treatment. This action also reduces the number of patients in Admissions, which helps manage the workload.
