To achieve the goal of the villain controlling the president, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **The villain threatens the president.** This action is necessary because it instills fear in the president, making him more susceptible to the villain's influence. The villain needs to establish dominance over the president to gain control.

2. **The villain coerces the president into wanting the villain to have Money.** By using the fear established from the threat, the villain can manipulate the president's desires. This action is crucial as it aligns the president's goals with the villain's, making it easier for the villain to exert control.

3. **The villain gives Money to the president.** This action solidifies the villain's control over the president. By providing the money, the villain creates a dependency, as the president now has a reason to align with the villain's interests.

After these actions, the villain successfully controls the president, achieving the desired outcome.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Threatening the president**: Establishes fear and opens the door for manipulation.
- **Coercing the president**: Aligns the president's goals with the villain's, making him more compliant.
- **Giving Money to the president**: Creates a dependency that cements the villain's control over the president.
