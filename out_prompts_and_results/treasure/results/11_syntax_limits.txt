After Hawkins successfully dug up the treasure on the island, he held it tightly in his hands. Silver, who had been convinced by Hawkins' earlier rumor, believed that the treasure was rightfully his. However, Hawkins had outsmarted Silver and claimed the treasure first. 

Seeing Silver's disappointment, Hawkins decided to take a bold step. He approached Silver and offered him a deal. "Iâ€™ll share some of the treasure with you if you promise to let me keep the rest," Hawkins proposed. Silver, realizing he had no other option, agreed to the deal. 

Hawkins then took the treasure, ensuring he had secured his goal while also keeping Silver satisfied enough to avoid conflict.
