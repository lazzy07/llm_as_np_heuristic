In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I3). 

Given the current situation, the following action will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **trade(Blake, I2, Alex, I3, R22)**: Blake can trade the item they have (which is I2, the chocolates) with Alex for the item Alex wants (I3, the flowers). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy. Since Blake also wants Alex to be happy, this action satisfies both of their goals.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake will be happy because they successfully made Alex happy.
- Casey's happiness is not directly affected by this action, but it does not hinder Blake's goal.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the action:
- The trade allows Blake to give away the chocolates (I2) they have, which they may not want, in exchange for the flowers (I3) that Alex desires. This action is efficient as it achieves both Blake's and Alex's happiness in one step.
