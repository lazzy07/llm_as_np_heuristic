Bubba is at the bank, hungry and wanting money. He has already stolen the rifle from the clerk at gunpoint. To achieve his goal of having money, he needs to intimidate the clerk into giving him money. 

1. **Bubba decides to get money.** (This is his goal.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to eliminate the threat and take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, he can take the money to achieve his goal.)

Now, Bubba has the money he wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Deciding to get money** is necessary as it establishes Bubba's goal.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a direct action to remove any obstacles to obtaining the money. Since the clerk has no money and is not hungry, this action is justified as it allows Bubba to take the money without further resistance.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.
