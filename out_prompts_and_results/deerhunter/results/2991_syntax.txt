To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Given the current situation, Bubba is already at the bank, has a loaded rifle, and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is also present and is aware of Bubba's presence. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money from the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger after the events at the bank.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger.

The actions taken ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money and satisfying his hunger.
