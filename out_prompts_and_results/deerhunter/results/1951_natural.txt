Bubba is determined to get money, and he is currently at the bank with the clerk. Since Bubba is hungry, he needs to take actions that will allow him to achieve his goal of obtaining money. 

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk to give him the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money without needing to go hunting or foraging.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money. The clerk, being unarmed and not hungry, cannot resist the theft.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest**: After stealing the money, Bubba decides to leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving his goal but serves to create distance from the clerk after the theft.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted.
