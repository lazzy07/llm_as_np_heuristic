Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where they have just made peace with each other. To ensure their safety and health, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to further their friendship and ensure they are both safe from the dangers of the surface.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their friendship in the cave, a safer location. This is important for both characters to feel secure and to solidify their bond.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship from the cave. This action is crucial for her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she needs to ensure she is in a secure environment.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Lizard, Ship, Surface)**: The Lizard teleports to the spaceship to join Zoe. This action is necessary for the Lizard to be safe and to continue building their friendship with Zoe.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe and the Lizard make peace again on the spaceship. This action ensures that both characters are healthy, safe, and have established a friendship.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard.
