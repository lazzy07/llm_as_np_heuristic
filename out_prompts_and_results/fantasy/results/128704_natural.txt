To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the cave with Rory and Gargax, while Vince is at the village with the money. The treasure is with Rory, and Talia has proposed to Rory, who accepted. 

To achieve Talia's goal of happiness or wealth, we can have the following actions:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action will remove Rory from the story, allowing Talia to take the treasure from Rory's dead body. Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry, so this action aligns with Gargax's goals as well.

2. **Talia takes the treasure from Rory's body**: After Rory is eaten by Gargax, Talia can take the treasure, which will increase her wealth.

3. **Talia proposes to Gargax**: Since Gargax is now the only character left in the cave, Talia can propose to him. Gargax, who wants to be wealthy, may accept the proposal, leading to Talia's happiness.

4. **Gargax accepts Talia's proposal**: This will make Talia happy, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's outline the actions and their explanations:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary to remove Rory from the story, allowing Talia to access the treasure.
2. **Talia takes the treasure from Rory's body**: This action increases Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.
3. **Talia proposes to Gargax**: This action is necessary for Talia to seek happiness through marriage.
4. **Gargax accepts Talia's proposal**: This action fulfills Talia's goal of happiness.

With these actions, Talia will achieve her goal of becoming happy and wealthy.
