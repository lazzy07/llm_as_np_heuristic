To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot treat Jones effectively.

2. **Treat Jones in PatientRoomC with the appropriate treatment**: Once Hathaway assesses Jones and identifies the symptoms, they will treat Jones with the correct medication (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is necessary to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk Hathaway from PatientRoomC to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to return to the admissions room to assess the other patients, Ross and Young, who are still in the admissions room.

4. **Walk Hathaway from Admissions to ExamRoomB**: Hathaway will then admit Ross to ExamRoomB to assess his symptoms.

5. **Assess Ross in ExamRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms, which is necessary for providing the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Ross in ExamRoomB with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct medication based on his symptoms.

7. **Walk Hathaway from ExamRoomB to Admissions**: Hathaway will return to the admissions room to assess Young.

8. **Walk Hathaway from Admissions to ExamRoomA**: Hathaway will admit Young to ExamRoomA to assess his symptoms.

9. **Assess Young in ExamRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

10. **Treat Young in ExamRoomA with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct medication based on his symptoms.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
