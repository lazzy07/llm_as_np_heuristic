To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with Blake, who has the flowers.

2. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This is necessary for Blake to be able to trade items with Casey.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Blake has. This is the key action that allows Alex to eventually get the flowers.

4. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the flowers. This is necessary for Casey to give the flowers to Alex.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action ensures that Alex now has the item they want, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
