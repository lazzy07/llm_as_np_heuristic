Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous due to the potential eruption of the volcano. They have already established a friendly relationship, which is crucial for Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures. To ensure both characters are safe and healthy, Zoe needs to take decisive actions.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface increasingly dangerous. This action is not necessary since it has already been initiated.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to move to a safer location away from the erupting volcano.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it helps both characters achieve their goal of making friends.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action ensures her safety from the erupting volcano.

5. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard, ensuring that she maintains her friendship and connection with him.

6. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Finally, Zoe and the Lizard reaffirm their friendship on the surface, solidifying their bond and achieving their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

The sequence of actions ensures that both characters remain safe from the dangers of the volcano while also achieving their goal of friendship.
