In the dining room, Alex holds the flowers and is happy. Blake, who is not happy, wants the chocolates, and Casey, also not happy, wants the jewelry. To help Blake achieve happiness, Alex decides to give the chocolates to Blake.

**Action:**
1. Alex gives the chocolates to Blake.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it allows Blake to achieve happiness by receiving the item he wants (the chocolates). Since Alex is already happy with the flowers, this action does not affect Alex's happiness negatively. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is still happy with the flowers.
- Blake is now happy with the chocolates.
- Casey remains unhappy with the jewelry.

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of being happy while also helping Blake to be happy.
