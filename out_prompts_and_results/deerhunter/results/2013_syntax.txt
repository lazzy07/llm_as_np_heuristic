To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba obtaining the money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will travel from the forest to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money.
2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Although Bubba already has the rifle loaded, we can include this action to emphasize that he is prepared for any confrontation.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk at the bank, using the rifle as a threat.
4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action is already implied since Bubba is stealing the money, but we can include it to reinforce his greed.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located.
- **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: This action ensures that Bubba is ready to intimidate the bank clerk if necessary, reinforcing his threat.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This is the critical action that allows Bubba to obtain the money from the bank clerk.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action reflects Bubba's motivation and greed, which drives him to steal the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
