To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where they believe the item they want (I1) is located. This is necessary for Alex to access the item.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to be closer to Alex and Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the connection between the characters.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake. This action also helps maintain the connection between the characters.

After these actions, Alex will have the item they want (I1), thus achieving their goal of happiness.
