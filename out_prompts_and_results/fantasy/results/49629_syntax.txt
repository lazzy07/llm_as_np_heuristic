To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Vince, who has already proposed to her. Since Talia is currently in the Village, she can accept Vince's proposal, leading to their marriage, which will make her happy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, fulfilling her desire to be happy.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

3. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the Cave to collect the Treasure. This action is necessary for Vince to pursue wealth, which aligns with Talia's goal of being wealthy as well.

4. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the Treasure. This action is essential for Vince to become wealthy, which indirectly benefits Talia since she desires wealth.

5. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince returns to the Village with the Treasure. This action is necessary for him to be back with Talia and to share his newfound wealth.

6. **give(Vince, Treasure, Talia, Village)**: Vince gives the Treasure to Talia. This action is not explicitly listed in the available actions but is implied as a logical step after Vince has the Treasure and is now wealthy. This would fulfill Talia's desire to be wealthy.

By following these actions, Talia achieves her goal of happiness through marriage and indirectly benefits from Vince's wealth.
