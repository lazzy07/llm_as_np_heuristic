In this story, we will focus on Ross, who is currently in PatientRoomB and wants to be alive and healthy. Hathaway, the doctor, has a workload of 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake if she assesses or treats a patient. However, since Ross is already in the same room as Hathaway, we can take advantage of this situation to ensure Ross receives the correct treatment.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but we will assume she correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as a rash, indicating he has Jarkis.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

With these two actions, Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment. Despite the risk of misdiagnosis due to Hathaway's high workload, we assume she correctly identifies the rash as a symptom of Jarkis.
- **Treat Ross**: This action is crucial as it provides the necessary treatment (steroids) for Ross's condition, ensuring he recovers and achieves his goal of being healthy.
