To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because the clerk has money that Bubba desires, and since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully shoot the clerk.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it allows Bubba to fulfill his goal of obtaining money.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, enters the bank with a loaded rifle. He sees the bank clerk, who has money. 
- In a moment of desperation and greed, Bubba shoots the clerk, eliminating the threat and allowing him to take the money.
- With the clerk down, Bubba picks up the money, achieving his goal.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
