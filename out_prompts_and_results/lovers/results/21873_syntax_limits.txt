To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that the flowers are in the bathroom (R22), and Alex is in the dining room (R21). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the bathroom to get the flowers.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the bathroom.

Now, Alex has the flowers, which makes them happy. 

**Explanation of actions:**
- The first action is necessary for Alex to reach the location of the flowers.
- The second action is necessary for Alex to acquire the flowers, which is the item they want to be happy.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
