**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is currently experiencing "Unknown," this assessment will help Hathaway identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming that Ross has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This is a critical step to ensure Ross becomes healthy. If Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis, he would treat him incorrectly, leading to a negative outcome.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.**  
   - Young is currently in Admissions and needs to be assigned to an exam room for assessment. This action is necessary to ensure that Young can also be treated if needed.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This assessment is crucial to determine Young's symptoms, which are currently "Unknown." Identifying Young's condition will allow Hathaway to provide the appropriate treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway treats him with steroids. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat both patients effectively. The assessments are necessary to identify the diseases, and the treatments are critical to achieving the goal of making all patients healthy. The sequence of actions is designed to minimize the risk of mistakes by keeping Dr. Hathaway's workload manageable (below three) and ensuring that both patients receive the correct treatment based on their symptoms.
