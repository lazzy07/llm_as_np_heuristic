To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) has the jewelry, but Casey is not happy because they want the chocolates (I2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where they can interact with Blake.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to facilitate the next actions.

2. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I2, R12)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Blake for the chocolates (I2).
   - This action allows Blake to receive the jewelry they want, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room (R22) after the trade.
   - This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but helps to maintain the flow of the story.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
