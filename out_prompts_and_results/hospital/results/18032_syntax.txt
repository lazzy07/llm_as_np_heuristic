To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Young's symptoms is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young in PatientRoomB with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is essential for Young to become healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Young to identify their symptoms. This is a critical step because without knowing whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats them with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is vital for Young to recover and achieve their goal of being healthy.

Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake during the assessment. However, for the sake of this story, we will assume that Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms and administers the right treatment.
