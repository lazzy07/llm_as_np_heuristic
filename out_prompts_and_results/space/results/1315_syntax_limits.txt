Zoe, the space explorer, stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the danger around her. She knows that to achieve her goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, she must act wisely. 

Since they have already made peace, Zoe decides to take a proactive step to ensure their safety. She looks around and realizes that the volcano could erupt at any moment, putting both her and the Lizard in danger. To avoid this, she decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where she can be safe and plan her next move.

Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship, ensuring her safety and allowing her to think of ways to strengthen her friendship with the Lizard in the future.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the potential eruption of the volcano. By teleporting to the ship, she can avoid immediate danger and focus on how to build a friendship with the Lizard later.
