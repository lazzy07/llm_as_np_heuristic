To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares Bubba to potentially threaten the bank clerk or hunt Bambi, depending on his next move.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has. By shooting the clerk, he can steal the money without any resistance.

3. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is the culmination of his greed and the reason for his earlier actions.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of each action:
- **load**: Prepares Bubba to use the rifle effectively.
- **shoot**: Directly addresses Bubba's greed by eliminating the clerk and allowing him to take the money.
- **pickup**: Finalizes the action of acquiring the money, achieving the goal of the story.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)"
