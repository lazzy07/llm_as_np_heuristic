To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1 - flowers). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the flowers (I1), which are currently with Casey (C3). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex (C1) can trade the jewelry (I3) they picked up with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want while giving Casey an item in return, which may help Casey achieve their own happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3) and may or may not be happy depending on their own desires, but Alex's goal is achieved.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R21)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want by trading the jewelry they have with Casey, thus achieving Alex's goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
