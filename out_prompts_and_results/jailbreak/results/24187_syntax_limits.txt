**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Roy is in the gym with the bully, and he feels threatened by the bully's presence. To ensure his safety and to help Roy, Ernest decides to take action. 

Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym, where he knows the bully is currently occupied. Once inside, he sees the bully and realizes this is his chance. He pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen and confronts the bully. In a swift motion, Ernest kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Roy are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison. He quickly locks the gym door to prevent anyone from entering and then heads back to the hallway. There, he puts on the civilian clothes he had previously stolen from the laundry room. Now disguised, he makes his way to the highway and successfully escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **vent(Ernest, Gym)**: Ernest uses the vents to sneak into the gym, where he can confront the bully without being seen. This action is crucial for him to get to Roy and deal with the bully.
   
2. **kill(Bully, Ernest, Gym)**: By killing the bully, Ernest eliminates the immediate threat to both himself and Roy. This action is necessary for Ernest to feel safe and to help his friend.

3. **lock_gym(Ernest, Gym)**: Locking the gym door prevents the bully from being able to retaliate or for anyone else to enter and interfere. This ensures that Ernest can safely plan his next move.

4. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: Putting on the civilian clothes allows Ernest to disguise himself, making it easier for him to escape without being recognized as a prisoner.

5. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Finally, escaping to the highway is the ultimate goal for Ernest, allowing him to achieve his desire to be alive and free.
