Zoe and the Lizard stand on the dangerous surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent threat posed by the erupting volcano. They have already established a friendship, which is crucial for their safety and mutual goals. To ensure they both remain healthy and safe, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to escape the dangerous surface and ensure her safety. Since she is friends with the Lizard, she hopes to communicate with him from the safety of the ship.

2. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure he is safe. This action reinforces their friendship and shows her commitment to helping him.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** By walking to the cave, they can find shelter from the erupting volcano. This action is essential for both characters to remain safe and healthy.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their bond in the cave ensures that they can work together to find a solution to the danger outside.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard wait in the cave until the eruption is over.** This action is implied as they remain in the cave, ensuring their safety until the danger has passed.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
