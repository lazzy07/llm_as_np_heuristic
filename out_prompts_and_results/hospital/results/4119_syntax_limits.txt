**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, walks to PatientRoomA to assess Ross. 

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA. Since Ross is showing symptoms of a rash, Hathaway believes he has Jarkis. However, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze. 

2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, thinking it will help him. Unfortunately, this is the wrong treatment for Ross's actual condition (Jarkis), and he dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the Admissions room to assess Young, who is waiting there.

4. **Admit Young**: Hathaway admits Young to PatientRoomB, increasing the workload to 3 again, but now he can focus on Young next.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine the symptoms and decide on treatment. 
- **Treat Ross**: Although this action leads to a negative outcome, it is essential for the story to show the consequences of Hathaway's mistake due to the high workload.
- **Walk to Admissions**: This action allows Hathaway to move to the next patient, Young, and continue his efforts to help patients.
- **Admit Young**: This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to manage his workload and prepare to assess Young in the next steps.
