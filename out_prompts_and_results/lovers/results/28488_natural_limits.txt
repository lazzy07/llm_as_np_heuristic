In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is already happy with the jewelry. 

To help Blake achieve their goal, the following action takes place:

1. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.** This action is necessary because it allows Blake to relinquish the flowers, which Alex wants, while Blake can then focus on finding the chocolates. 

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry.

However, since the goal is for Blake to achieve happiness, Blake needs to find the chocolates. 

To ensure Blake achieves their goal, the next action is:

2. **Blake moves to the bathroom.** This action is necessary because Blake believes the chocolates are in the bathroom, and moving there gives Blake the opportunity to find them.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy with the flowers.
- Blake is now in the bathroom, where they can search for the chocolates.
- Casey is still happy with the jewelry.

Now, Blake can find the chocolates in the bathroom, achieving their goal of happiness.
