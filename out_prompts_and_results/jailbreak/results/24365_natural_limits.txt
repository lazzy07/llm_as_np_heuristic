As Roy is in the gym, he realizes that the bully is unaware of his presence since the door is locked. With the knife in hand, he decides to take advantage of the situation. He approaches the bully quietly and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. 

Now that the threat is eliminated, Roy can safely escape. He quickly crawls back through the vent to the hallway, where he finds the civilian clothes he had previously stolen. He puts them on to disguise himself. With the disguise in place, he makes his way to the highway outside the prison.
