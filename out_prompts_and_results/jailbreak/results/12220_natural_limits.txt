**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of his decision. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, continues to pace, believing he has the upper hand. 

In a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully, using the knife to defend himself and eliminate the threat. The bully, caught off guard, falls to the ground, and Roy stands over him, breathing heavily. With the bully no longer a threat, Roy takes a moment to collect himself.

Now, with the gym door locked and the bully incapacitated, Roy knows he must escape. He quickly searches the gym for a way out and remembers the civilian clothes in the laundry room. He sneaks through the vent back to the hallway, then makes his way to the laundry room. 

Once in the laundry room, he puts on the civilian clothes, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he heads to the highway, where he can finally escape the prison.
