To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The merchant will walk back to the market, leaving the medicine at the crossroads. This action is necessary because Tom needs to be able to take the medicine without the merchant being present.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will then walk from the crossroads to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to reach the cottage without any conflict or interference from the merchant, who has moved away from the crossroads.
