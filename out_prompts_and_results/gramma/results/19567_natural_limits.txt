The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market and decides to take action. She approaches the guard and, without hesitation, attacks him. The guard, unarmed and caught off guard, falls to the ground. The bandit then loots the guard's sword, adding to her arsenal. With the guard out of the way, she now feels secure in her position.

Next, the bandit walks to the chest at the bandit camp, where she places the hero's coin she looted from the merchant earlier. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack the guard**: The bandit needs to eliminate the guard to ensure her safety and to prevent any interference with her plans.
2. **Loot the guard's sword**: By taking the guard's sword, the bandit increases her power and security, making her a more formidable presence.
3. **Walk to the bandit camp**: This action is necessary for the bandit to secure her coins in the chest, which is her ultimate goal.
