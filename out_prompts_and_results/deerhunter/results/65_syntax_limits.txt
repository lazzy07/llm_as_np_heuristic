After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is hungry and decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain energy. Since he is already in the forest where Bambi is located, he can easily eat the animal without needing to move to another location. 

Next, Bubba decides to go back to the bank. He is aware that the bank clerk has money and is greedy, which means he can take advantage of the situation. 

Finally, Bubba can steal the money from the bank clerk since he has just eaten and is now feeling more confident. He can use the rifle to intimidate the clerk into handing over the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)** - Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)** - Bubba goes back to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)** - Bubba steals the money from the clerk using the rifle.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of satisfying his hunger and obtaining money.
