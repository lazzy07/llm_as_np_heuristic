The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the situation at the market. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she sees the hero, the merchant, and the guard. The bandit knows that the hero is carrying a sword, but she also knows that the merchant is unarmed. 

The bandit approaches the merchant and robs her of the medicine, which is the item she needs to achieve her goal of having as many coins as possible in the chest at the bandit camp. The bandit successfully takes the medicine from the merchant and then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and her coins safely.
