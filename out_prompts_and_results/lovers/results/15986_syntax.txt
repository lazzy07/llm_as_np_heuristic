To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want (I3), the following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22) to interact with them and potentially obtain the item they want.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the item I3 (which is in R22) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to R12 after receiving the item. This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but helps to conclude the story by returning to the starting point.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have obtained the item they wanted (I3).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach the location where the other characters are, allowing for interaction and the possibility of receiving the item.
- **give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to achieve happiness by receiving the item they want.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While this action does not contribute to Alex's happiness, it serves to wrap up the story by returning to the original room.
