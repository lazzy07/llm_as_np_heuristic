To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her current situation and the available actions. Talia is already married to Vince, which contributes to her happiness. However, she is not yet wealthy, as she only has money but no treasure. 

The goal is to make Talia happy or wealthy. Since she is already married, we can focus on her wealth. The treasure is located in the cave, and Vince currently has the money. 

Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary because acquiring the treasure will increase her wealth.
2. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry, which is a natural consequence of the story and sets up the next action.
3. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is necessary to remove Rory from the story, as he is a potential threat to Talia's happiness and wealth.
4. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is necessary to ensure Talia has both the treasure and the money, making her wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have both the treasure and the money, making her wealthy, which fulfills her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which is essential for her wealth.
- **get_hungry(Gargax)**: This action is included to create a scenario where Gargax is motivated to eat someone, leading to the next action.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: By removing Rory, Talia is left without any competition or threat, allowing her to focus on her goals.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: This action ensures Talia has both items needed to achieve her goal of wealth.
