To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The Bandit walks to the Merchant's location to confront her and potentially rob her of the coins.
2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Merchant)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins she has. This action is possible because the Merchant is unarmed and the Bandit is armed.
3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Camp)**: The Bandit walks back to the Camp with the stolen coins.

This sequence of actions allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The Bandit needs to reach the Merchant to rob her. This is the only way to acquire coins without risking confrontation with the Guard.
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Merchant)**: The Bandit successfully robs the Merchant, which is crucial for her goal of acquiring coins. The Merchant is unarmed, making her an easy target.
- **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Camp)**: After acquiring the coins, the Bandit returns to her camp, ensuring that the coins are safely in her possession.
