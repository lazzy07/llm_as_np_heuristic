Zoe, the space explorer, is currently in the cave on the planet. She knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface and is not safe. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, so she decides to take action to achieve her goal.

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to find the Lizard. This action is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe reaches the surface, she approaches the Lizard and initiates a conversation to make peace. This action is crucial as it allows Zoe to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is one of her primary goals.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, ship)**: After successfully making peace with the Lizard, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship. This action ensures her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she can now monitor the situation from her ship.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
