**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy, who is currently in the hallway, decides to take action to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. Knowing that the bully is locked in the gym, Roy takes a calculated risk. He uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to confront the bully. 

Roy moves to the gym and, with the knife in hand, he unlocks the door and enters. The bully, surprised and threatened, tries to assert his dominance, but Roy is determined. In a swift motion, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. 

With the bully out of the way, Roy can now focus on escaping the prison. He quickly makes his way back to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, and heads to the highway. Disguised and free, Roy successfully escapes the prison.
