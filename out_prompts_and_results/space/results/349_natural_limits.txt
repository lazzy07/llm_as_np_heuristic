Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back down to the planet to warn the Lizard. She believes that the Lizard is unaware of the imminent eruption and wants to help. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and inform him about the eruption.)

As they stand together, the volcano begins to erupt violently.
