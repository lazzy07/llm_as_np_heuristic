To achieve Blake's goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom.** (Blake wants to mislead Casey into thinking the chocolates are in the bathroom, which will prompt Casey to move there.)
2. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (Casey believes Blake's statement and goes to look for the chocolates.)
3. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.** (Blake moves to a different room to avoid being in the same space as Casey while they search for the chocolates.)
4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (Blake finds the chocolates in the dining room, achieving their goal of happiness.)

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom:** This action is crucial because it creates a diversion for Casey, allowing Blake to access the chocolates without interference.
- **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom:** This action is necessary as it follows Blake's misleading information, allowing Blake to act freely.
- **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room:** This action is important for Blake to avoid being in the same room as Casey while they search for the chocolates, ensuring that Blake can pick them up without being caught.
- **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room:** This is the final action that fulfills Blake's goal of happiness, as they now possess the item they wanted.
