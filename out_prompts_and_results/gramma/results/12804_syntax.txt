To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently unarmed and carrying the medicine. This action allows the Bandit to take the coins that Tom has, increasing her wealth.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins safely in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit successfully increases her coin count and achieves her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: The Bandit takes advantage of Tom's unarmed state to steal his coins. This is a direct action towards the Bandit's goal of accumulating coins.
- **Walking to the Camp**: After acquiring the coins, the Bandit moves to the camp to secure her loot, ensuring that she has coins in her possession or in the chest.
