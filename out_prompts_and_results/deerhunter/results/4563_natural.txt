To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.)
2. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (Bambi is dead, and Bubba can eat her to satisfy his hunger.)
3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to go to the bank to get the money.)
4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the clerk's money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba decides to eat:** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and he needs to eat to regain energy or health.
- **Bubba eats Bambi:** Since Bambi is dead, Bubba can eat her, which fulfills his hunger and allows him to focus on his goal of obtaining money.
- **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank:** After eating, Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and obtain the money.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** With the rifle loaded, Bubba can successfully steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.
