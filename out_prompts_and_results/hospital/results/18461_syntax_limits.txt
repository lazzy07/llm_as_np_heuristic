In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is in Patient Room B with Jones, who has been admitted to that room. Ross and Young are still in the admissions room. To ensure all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat Jones, who is currently the only patient in the exam room.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.

By taking these two actions, Hathaway can effectively diagnose and treat Jones, ensuring he is healthy. Since Jones is the only patient in the exam room, this is the most efficient way to achieve the goal.
