Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still low enough to avoid mistakes. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This is a risky move since Ross's symptoms are unknown, but Hathaway hopes for the best. Fortunately, Ross actually has Flaze, and the treatment is successful, making him healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also in Patient Room A. Young is experiencing Unknown as well, but Hathaway's workload is now 2, still manageable. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, again hoping for the best. Young also has Flaze, and the treatment is successful, making him healthy too.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to the Admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Since Jones is still experiencing Unknown, Hathaway will need to assess him next.

In this story, all patients are treated successfully, and Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
