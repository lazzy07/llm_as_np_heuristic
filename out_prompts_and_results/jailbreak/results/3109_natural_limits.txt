**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take action. He knows he needs to secure his safety and the cigarettes he has stolen. He quickly moves from the kitchen to the hallway, where he can access the gym. Once in the hallway, he locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action ensures that the bully cannot reach him or Roy, alleviating the immediate threat to their lives.

With the bully locked away, Ernest feels a surge of confidence. He then puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. Now, he can safely make his way to the highway without fear of being recognized or threatened.
