**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is alive and healthy, Hathaway needs to identify if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This action is necessary to understand Jones's condition and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomB**: After assessing, Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Jones, PatientRoomB, Admissions**: After receiving treatment, Jones walks back to the Admissions room to confirm his health status and possibly check on other patients. This action is not strictly necessary for his health but aligns with his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is essential for diagnosing Jones's condition, which is the first step toward treatment.
- The second action is critical as it directly leads to Jones's recovery from Flaze, ensuring he achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
- The third action, while not necessary for his health, shows Jones's proactive approach to his well-being and allows for potential interactions with other patients or staff.
