Zoe and the Lizard have just made peace on the surface of the planet. They both want to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. However, the volcano on the surface is a looming threat. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting, we can have Zoe and the Lizard continue their peaceful interaction, but the volcano will erupt unexpectedly, leading to one of them dying.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending disaster.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks towards the cave, seeking shelter from the eruption. This action shows her desire to stay safe and healthy.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, indicating that it also wants to stay safe. This action reinforces their growing friendship as they seek safety together.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing destruction on the surface. This action fulfills the requirement for the volcano to erupt and leads to the death of one character.

5. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: The Lizard, in a moment of panic during the eruption, accidentally causes a rock to fall on Zoe, killing her. This action results in Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement for a character to die.

6. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard reflects on their time together and realizes that they had become friends before the eruption. This action symbolizes the friendship that was formed, even if it was short-lived.

The story ends with the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard recognizing their friendship.
