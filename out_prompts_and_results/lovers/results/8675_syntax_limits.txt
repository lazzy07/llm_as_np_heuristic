In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, and they are in the same room (R22) as Casey (C2) and Blake (C3). However, Casey wants the chocolates (I2), which are in the dining room (R21), and Blake wants the jewelry (I3), which is with Casey. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Alex to give the flowers to Casey, as they are both in the same room. This action will not only make Alex happy but also help Casey, who is currently unhappy.

Hereâ€™s the action taken:

1. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action makes Alex happy because they have given away the item they wanted (flowers), and it also helps Casey, who is now in possession of the flowers.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have given away the flowers.
- Casey is happy because they received the flowers.
- Blake remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, the story ends here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The action of giving the flowers to Casey is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire to be happy by obtaining the item they wanted. Since all characters are in the same room, this action is straightforward and efficient.
