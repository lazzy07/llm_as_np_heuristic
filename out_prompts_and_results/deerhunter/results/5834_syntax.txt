To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a dead Bambi and has a loaded rifle. The bank clerk is at the bank, and Bubba knows the clerk has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba is hungry, and since Bambi is dead, he can eat her. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain energy, which is essential for his next actions.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will steal the money from the clerk using his loaded rifle. This action directly fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Eating Bambi**: This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry, and eating will help him regain strength for the next steps.
- **Going to the Bank**: This action is essential for Bubba to confront the bank clerk, who has the money he desires.
- **Stealing from the Clerk**: This action is the culmination of Bubba's plan to achieve his goal of acquiring money.
