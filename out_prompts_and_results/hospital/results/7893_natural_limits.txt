Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach Jones and Ross, who are currently in the admissions room.

   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Ross allows Dr. Hathaway to identify his symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**  
   - After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can assign him to an exam room for treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis (assuming he has the rash).**  
   - This action is essential to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment, which will make him healthy.

6. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can assign him to an exam room for treatment.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze (assuming he has a fever).**  
   - This action ensures that Ross receives the correct treatment, which will make him healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
