To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Hathaway (Doctor) Ross (Patient) to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room where Hathaway can assess and treat him. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 0, he can admit Ross without any risk of making a mistake.

2. **Assess Hathaway (Doctor) Ross (Patient) SymptomA in Exam Room B**: This action allows Hathaway to evaluate Ross's symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, Hathaway will correctly identify the disease.

3. **Treat Hathaway (Doctor) Ross (Patient) with Antibiotics in Exam Room B**: Since Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to the disease Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Walk Young (Patient) from Admissions to Exam Room C**: This action is included to ensure Young is moved to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to potentially assess and treat him later, but it is not directly related to Ross's immediate goal.

5. **Walk Jones (Patient) from Admissions to Exam Room A**: Similar to Young, this action is to move Jones to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat him later, but it does not affect Ross's immediate goal.

The story concludes with Ross being treated successfully and achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.
