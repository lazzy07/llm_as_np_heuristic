To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room as well. This is important to identify Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment.
