In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, while Casey (C3) wants the jewelry (I2) and Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I3). Since Alex is in the same room as Casey and Blake, they can take action to help themselves.

1. **Action: trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R22)** - Alex trades the flowers (I1) they want with Blake (C2) for the chocolates (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire (I1) while also ensuring that Blake is happy with the chocolates.

- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake is happy because they received the flowers (I1) in exchange for the chocolates (I3).
- Casey remains unhappy because they still do not have the jewelry (I2).

However, since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action successfully achieves that.
