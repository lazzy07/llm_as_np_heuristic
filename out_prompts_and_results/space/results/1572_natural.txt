Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to help the Lizard, despite their current enmity. She believes that if she can save the Lizard, they might become friends. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** (This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and the dangerous surface.)
2. **Zoe walks to the Lizard.** (Zoe approaches the Lizard to communicate and offer help.)
3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** (Zoe attempts to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is crucial for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and friendship.)
4. **The volcano erupts.** (This event occurs as a consequence of the previous actions, creating a life-threatening situation.)
5. **Zoe and the Lizard work together to escape the eruption.** (This action is implied as they both realize the need to cooperate for survival, solidifying their friendship.)

In this sequence, Zoe's initial action of teleporting back to the surface is driven by her desire to help the Lizard, which leads to a peaceful resolution. The eruption of the volcano serves as a catalyst for their cooperation and eventual friendship.
