To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not in any of the rooms, and we need to facilitate a way for Blake to acquire it. 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Blake moves to the dining room (R12)**: This is necessary because Blake needs to be in a room where they can interact with the other characters and potentially trade or receive items.
   
2. **Blake tells Casey that they want the jewelry (I2)**: This action is important because it communicates Blake's desire to Casey, who may have the information or means to help Blake get the jewelry.

3. **Casey moves to the bathroom (R11)**: Casey needs to move to a different room to potentially find the jewelry or to create a situation where they can help Blake.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates (I3) in the dining room (R12)**: This action allows Blake to have an item that they can use to trade or give to Casey.

5. **Blake moves to the living room (R22)**: This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey, allowing for further interaction.

6. **Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Casey**: This action is crucial as it allows Blake to trade an item they have for the item they want, which is the jewelry.

7. **Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake**: This final action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, making them happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Move to R12**: Blake needs to be in a room to interact.
- **Tell Casey about wanting I2**: Communication is key for collaboration.
- **Move to R11**: Casey needs to be in a position to help.
- **Pick up I3**: Blake needs an item to trade.
- **Move to R22**: Blake needs to be with Casey to trade.
- **Give I3 to Casey**: This is the trade action.
- **Receive I2 from Casey**: This fulfills Blake's goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(B, R12, R22)",
    "tell(B, C, I2, R22)",
    "move(C, R22, R11)",
    "pick_up(B, I3, R12)",
    "move(B, R12, R22)",
    "give(B, I3, C, R22)",
    "give(C, I2, B, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
