**Story Completion:**

As Roy sneaks through the vent into the gym, he sees Ernest and the bully. The bully, furious about the stolen cigarettes, is threatening both of them. Roy knows he has to act quickly to protect himself and Ernest. He pulls out the knife he stole from the kitchen and, with a swift motion, he lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, unable to defend himself, falls to the ground, and Roy has successfully killed him.

With the bully out of the way, Roy turns to Ernest and says, "We need to get out of here." They both know that the gym door is locked, but Roy has a plan. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room, disguising himself. He then unlocks the gym door and they both make their way to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, they crawl through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Now disguised, they can escape without being recognized.
