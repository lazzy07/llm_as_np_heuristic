To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba needs to be at the same location as the clerk to steal the money.)
3. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can shoot the clerk to eliminate him as a threat.)
4. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money he desires.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Go from the forest to the bank:** Bubba must be at the bank to interact with the clerk.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who has the money, making it easier for him to take it.
- **Pick up the money from the clerk:** This final action fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.
