**Story Completion:**

Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to protect himself and his friend, Ernest. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of the situation. The bully, unaware of Roy's intentions, continues to taunt him from across the room. 

In a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully with the knife, catching him off guard. The struggle is brief but intense, and ultimately, Roy manages to kill the bully. With the threat eliminated, Roy takes a moment to catch his breath. He then quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself.

Now disguised, Roy unlocks the gym door and makes his way to the hallway. He knows that the highway is his ticket to freedom. He crawls through the vents, emerging outside the prison. Once on the highway, he confidently walks away from the prison, finally free.
