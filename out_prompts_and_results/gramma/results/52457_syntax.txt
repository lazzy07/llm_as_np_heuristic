To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The bandit moves to the market to find Tom, who is carrying a coin. This is necessary for the bandit to potentially rob Tom.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit robs Tom of the coin he is carrying. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The bandit returns to the crossroads after robbing Tom. This is necessary to move back to a location where she can access her chest at the bandit camp.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit walks to the bandit camp to deposit the coins she has acquired. This is essential for securing her loot.

5. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit takes the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the bandit has the maximum amount of coins possible.
