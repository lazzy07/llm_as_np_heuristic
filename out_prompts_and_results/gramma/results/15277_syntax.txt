To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and potentially acquire more coins.

2. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from Tom using the coin she just looted from the Bandit. This action allows her to acquire an item that can be sold later for profit, thus increasing her overall wealth without engaging in criminal activity.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Crossroads to be in a central location where she can interact with other characters or make further transactions if needed.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market again to continue her business activities, potentially selling the medicine or other items she may acquire.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to maximize her coin collection while avoiding any criminal behavior, as she only engages in buying and selling.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The Merchant starts at the Crossroads and needs to return to the Market to conduct her business.
- By buying the medicine from Tom, she uses the coin she obtained from the Bandit, thus increasing her inventory without breaking any laws.
- Walking back and forth between the Market and Crossroads allows her to maintain her business operations effectively.
