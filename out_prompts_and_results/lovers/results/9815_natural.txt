To complete the story and ensure that Alex achieves their goal of being happy by having the flowers, we can follow these actions:

1. **Casey gives flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey is the only character who has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey helps Alex achieve happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the living room with the flowers.
- Blake is in the bathroom and is still not happy.
- Casey is in the living room and is not happy either.
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.

This is the shortest story that allows Alex to achieve their goal.
