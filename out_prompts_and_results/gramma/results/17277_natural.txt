**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, wanting to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, decides to rob the merchant at the crossroads. Since the merchant is not armed, the bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant and takes the medicine.

2. The bandit then walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp, where she can safely store her loot and keep the medicine.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Rob the Merchant:** The bandit robs the merchant because she wants to acquire the medicine, which is an item that can be useful for her or to trade later. The merchant is not armed, making her an easy target for the bandit.
  
- **Walk to the Bandit Camp:** After successfully robbing the merchant, the bandit walks to the bandit camp to secure her loot. This action ensures that she is away from the crossroads where the guard is present, minimizing the risk of being caught.
