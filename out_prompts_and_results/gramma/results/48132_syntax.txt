To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the coin from Tom, who is currently unarmed and unable to defend himself. This action allows the Bandit to gain a coin, which contributes to her goal of accumulating wealth.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins secured in her camp, further fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by first robbing Tom of his coin and then securing the coins from the chest at her camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Looting TomCoin from Tom**: This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count without risking her own safety, as Tom is unarmed.
- **Taking BanditCoin from the Chest**: This action is essential for the Bandit to ensure that she has coins stored safely, which is one of her primary objectives.
