**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, who is on the highway, realizes he needs to disguise himself to escape safely. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. Now disguised, he feels more secure and less threatened.

Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Roy is aware of the bully's threats and knows he needs to act fast. He decides to steal the knife from the kitchen, which will give him a means to defend himself and Ernest if the bully comes after them.

With the knife in hand, Roy moves to the hallway, planning to join Ernest. He knows that the bully is still in the gym, and he needs to be cautious. 

Ernest, now disguised, sees an opportunity to escape. He moves towards the highway, feeling confident in his disguise. He knows that if he can reach the highway, he can finally be free from the prison.
