As Roy stands in the hallway, he knows he must act quickly to help his friend Ernest. He decides to sneak through the vents to the gym, where he believes the bully is threatening Ernest. 

Once in the gym, Roy sees the bully looming over Ernest, who looks frightened. Roy, with the knife he stole earlier, takes a deep breath and confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he lunges forward and kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

With the bully out of the way, Roy helps Ernest to his feet. They quickly search the gym for the pack of cigarettes, but they don't find it. However, they know they can escape now that the bully is gone. They decide to head to the hallway, where Roy puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. 

Now disguised, they make their way to the highway outside the prison. With the guards distracted, they slip through the gates and escape into the night, finally free.
