To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to make peace and become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.**  
   - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the surface when the volcano erupts. 

2. **The volcano erupts.**  
   - This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.**  
   - This action is taken to ensure that despite the impending danger, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendship before the eruption occurs.

4. **The eruption finishes.**  
   - This action is necessary to conclude the eruption, which results in Zoe being killed since she is on the surface when it happens.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and she and the Lizard make peace before the eruption.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe needs to be on the surface for the volcano to erupt and to interact with the Lizard.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, leading to the death of Zoe.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for friendship.
- **finish_erupt(Surface)**: This action concludes the eruption, confirming Zoe's death.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that the story meets the specified ending conditions.
