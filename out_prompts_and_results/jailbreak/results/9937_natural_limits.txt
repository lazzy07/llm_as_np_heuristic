As the first day comes to a close, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decides to return to the prison to help his friend. 

Roy sneaks back through the vent into the hallway, then moves to the gym. He locks the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. With the bully now unable to threaten them, Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously planned to use for protection.
