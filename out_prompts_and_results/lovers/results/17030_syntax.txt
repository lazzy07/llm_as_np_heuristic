To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where Alex is located (R22). This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is important because Alex wants the flowers (I1) and needs to be happy to help Casey.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and help them achieve their goal.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This is crucial because it allows Casey to be happy, as they want Blake to be happy and now have the flowers.

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Blake and Alex. This is a necessary step to ensure all characters are together.

6. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake. This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness, as they want Blake to be happy.

- Blake moves to R22 to interact with Alex.
