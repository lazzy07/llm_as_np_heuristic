In the cave, Rory and Talia are married, but they lack wealth. Vince, who is at the village with the money, needs to be persuaded to come to the cave. Gargax, the dragon, is also present in the cave and is hungry for wealth. 

To achieve Rory's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions take place:

3. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince travels to the cave, bringing the money with him. This action is essential for Rory to achieve his goal of wealth.
