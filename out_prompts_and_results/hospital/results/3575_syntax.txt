To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has a fever, they will receive antibiotics for Flaze; if they have a rash, they will receive steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the Admissions room to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are healthy, even though the primary focus is on Jones.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms. This ensures that all patients are taken care of, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy.

Here’s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomA)**: This action is taken to identify Jones's symptoms.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), PatientRoomA)**: This action is taken to treat Jones based on the identified symptoms, ensuring they become healthy.
3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), Admissions)**: This action is taken to identify Young's symptoms, ensuring all patients are healthy.
4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), Admissions)**: This action is taken to treat Young based on their symptoms.

By following this sequence, Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy, and Hathaway will also fulfill their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
