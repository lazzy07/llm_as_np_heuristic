To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I2 - chocolates), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R22) where Alex and the jewelry (I1) are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially trade or receive the chocolates.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to mislead Casey into thinking that Alex wants the chocolates, which will prompt Casey to take action to get them.

3. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R21) to retrieve the chocolates (I2) since they believe Alex wants them.

4. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This is essential for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

5. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to give the chocolates to Alex.

6. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is crucial as it fulfills Casey's desire to make Blake happy, as they believe that giving the chocolates to Alex will help achieve that.

7. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to check on the situation and see if they can help Casey.

8. **give(C1, I1, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake, which makes Blake happy.
