Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This action is necessary for Casey to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This action is essential for Casey to have the item they desire.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to fulfill their desire to make Blake happy, which in turn aligns with Casey's own happiness.

5. **put_down(C2, I1, R22)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I1) in the living room. This action is necessary for Blake to be able to receive the jewelry from Casey.

6. **trade(C2, I1, C3, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I1) for the jewelry (I2) with Casey. This action is essential as it allows both characters to achieve their goals of happiness.
