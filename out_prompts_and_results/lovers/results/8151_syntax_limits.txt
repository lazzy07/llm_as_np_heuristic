In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy, which means they need to have the item they want (I3, which is the jewelry). 

Given the current situation, here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Action: move(C3, R21, R22)** - Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **Action: give(C2, I2, C3, R22)** - Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is necessary because Casey needs to receive an item from Blake, and it allows Blake to help Casey achieve happiness.

3. **Action: put_down(C3, I2, R22)** - Casey puts down the chocolates in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to clear the way for the next action.

4. **Action: give(C1, I1, C3, R22)** - Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey. This is crucial because it allows Casey to receive an item that they want, which is the jewelry (I3).

5. **Action: move(C3, R22, R21)** - Casey moves back to the living room (R21) to retrieve the jewelry.

6. **Action: pick_up(C3, I3, R21)** - Casey picks up the jewelry (I3) from the living room. This is the final action that allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- Casey moves to the dining room to be with Alex and Blake.
- Blake gives Casey chocolates, which is a step towards helping Casey.
- Casey puts down the chocolates to make room for the next item.
- Alex gives Casey the flowers, which is a necessary step for Casey to achieve happiness.
- Casey moves back to the living room to get the jewelry.
- Finally, Casey picks up the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I3, R21)"
