To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, who is now dead. Bubba is also hungry and has a desire for money. The bank clerk is still alive and has money in the bank.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, as she is dead and he is hungry. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain some energy.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.
3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will shoot the clerk with the rifle. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has.
4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This action fulfills his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is a basic need for survival.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to move to the bank to confront the clerk and access the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial for Bubba to eliminate the threat of the clerk and take the money.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
