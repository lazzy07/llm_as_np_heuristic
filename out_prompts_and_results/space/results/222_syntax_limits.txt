Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the dangerous surface of the planet, where she is determined to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. The Lizard, currently in a cave, is also seeking friendship and safety. 

To initiate a peaceful interaction, Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is crucial as it brings them into the same location, allowing for the possibility of friendship. 

Once Zoe arrives at the cave, she makes a peace offering to the Lizard. This action is essential because it directly addresses both characters' goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. 

The Lizard, recognizing Zoe's intentions, accepts the peace offering, and they both become friends. This resolution fulfills their mutual desires for companionship and safety.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)** - Zoe walks to the cave to meet the Lizard, which is necessary to initiate interaction.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which is essential for achieving their goal of friendship.
