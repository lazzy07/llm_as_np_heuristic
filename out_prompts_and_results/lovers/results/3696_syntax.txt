To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers from the dining room where they are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making Alex happy.

4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.
