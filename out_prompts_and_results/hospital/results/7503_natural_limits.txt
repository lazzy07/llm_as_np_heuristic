Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A. Since Young is the only patient assigned to that room, Hathaway can focus on diagnosing him. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Young's condition and determine the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: After diagnosing Young with Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Young's illness, ensuring he becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Jones from the Admissions room to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to manage Jones's care and ensure he is monitored for any potential symptoms.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room C**: Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross from the Admissions room to Patient Room C. This action is also necessary to ensure Ross receives the attention he needs.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young and admits the other patients, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and can be treated in due course.
