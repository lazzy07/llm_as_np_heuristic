To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead him to acquire the treasure while maintaining his happiness. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, the dragon, eats Rory. This action removes Rory from the story, which is necessary because Rory's presence complicates Vince's situation. With Rory gone, Vince can focus on the treasure without competition for Talia's affections or any potential conflict over the treasure.

2. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure located in the cave. This action directly contributes to Vince's goal of becoming wealthy.

3. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary for Vince to secure his wealth in a safe location.

4. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry. This action is included to ensure that Vince's hunger status is addressed, as he wants to be not hungry.

5. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax eats Talia. This action is included to remove Talia from the story, as she is no longer needed for Vince's happiness since he has already secured the treasure.

6. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince marries Talia. This action is included to ensure that Vince achieves happiness through marriage, fulfilling his goal of being happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- Gargax eats Rory to eliminate competition and potential conflict.
- Vince picks up the treasure to achieve wealth.
- Vince travels back to the village to secure his wealth.
- Vince gets hungry to address his hunger status.
- Gargax eats Talia to remove her from the story, as she is no longer needed for Vince's happiness.
- Vince marries Talia to achieve happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)",
    "pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)",
    "travel(Vince, Cave, Village)",
    "get_hungry(Vince)",
    "eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)",
    "marry(Vince, Talia, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Vince achieves his goals of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry in the shortest possible way.
