To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, who has proposed to her. Since Talia already has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, the next step is for her to accept Rory's proposal and marry him, which will also increase her happiness.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action is necessary because it leads to their marriage, which will make both characters happy.
2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married. This action is crucial as it solidifies their relationship and increases Talia's happiness.
3. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money from Vince. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she needs to have money in addition to the treasure she already possesses.

After these actions, Talia will be happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to having both treasure and money).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept**: This action is essential for Talia to move forward in her relationship with Rory, which is a key part of her happiness.
- **marry**: This action finalizes their commitment to each other, ensuring both characters experience happiness.
- **pickup**: This action allows Talia to increase her wealth, fulfilling her goal of being wealthy.
