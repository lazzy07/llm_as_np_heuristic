The bandit, having successfully robbed the hero of their coin, decides to take advantage of the chaos at the market. She knows that the guard is focused on the aftermath of the merchant's death and is unlikely to notice her actions. The bandit quickly walks from the market to the crossroads, where her chest is located. She retrieves the coins she has stored there, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
