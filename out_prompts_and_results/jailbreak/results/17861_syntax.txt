**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores in the laundry, Ernest is aware that he is threatened by the bully, who is currently in the gym. He knows that Roy has successfully disguised himself in civilian clothes and is on the highway. 

1. **next_day()**: The day transitions to Day 2. This is necessary to allow Roy to take further actions without the constraints of Day 1.

2. **go(Roy, Hall)**: Roy moves from the highway to the hallway. This action is essential for him to access the gym and potentially help Ernest.

3. **lock_gym(Roy, Hall)**: Roy locks the gym door while the bully is inside. This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront the bully without the risk of being threatened.

4. **vent(Roy, Gym)**: Roy crawls through the vents to enter the gym. This allows him to confront the bully directly.

5. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: Roy kills the bully with the knife. This action eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.

6. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: After the bully is dealt with, Roy returns to the hallway and helps Ernest put on the civilian clothes. This is crucial for their escape.

7. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Finally, Ernest escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
