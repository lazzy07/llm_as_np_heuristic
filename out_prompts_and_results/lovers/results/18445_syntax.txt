To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to interact with Casey to achieve their goal.

2. **pick_up(C2, I1, R12)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making Alex happy.

4. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.
- **pick_up(C2, I1, R12)**: Casey must pick up the flowers to give them to Alex.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the crucial action that allows Alex to receive the flowers, fulfilling their desire.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: This action is included for continuity, allowing Alex to return to the living room after receiving the flowers.
