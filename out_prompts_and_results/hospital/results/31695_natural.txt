**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway is currently at Patient Room A, where Young is experiencing a rash. Since Dr. Hathaway knows that a rash indicates Jarkis, she decides to treat Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.** 
   - This action is necessary because Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (rash). By treating Young correctly, Dr. Hathaway ensures that Young becomes healthy, which is her goal.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases by one, bringing it down to one. She then needs to address the other patients in Admissions.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are currently in Admissions.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to assign Jones to an exam room so that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat him.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to be in the same room as Jones to assess his condition.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones and observes Unknown.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still low (1), she will not make a mistake in diagnosing him.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**
   - This action is necessary because Jones is alive and needs treatment. Since his symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway assumes he has Flaze (fever) and treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases again, and she can now focus on Ross.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to admit Ross to an exam room.

8. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to assign Ross to an exam room so that Dr. Hathaway can assess and treat him.

9. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to be in the same room as Ross to assess his condition.

10. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and observes Unknown.**
    - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still low (1), she will not make a mistake in diagnosing him.

11. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**
    - This action is necessary because Ross is alive and needs treatment. Since his symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway assumes he has Flaze (fever) and treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

By treating both Young and Jones correctly, Dr. Hathaway achieves her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
