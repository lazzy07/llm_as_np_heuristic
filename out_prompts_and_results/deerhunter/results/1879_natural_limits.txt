After Bubba shoots Bambi, he realizes he is still hungry and wants to eat. Since Bambi is now dead, Bubba decides to eat Bambi. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to remain alive. 

Next, Bubba decides to go back to the bank to confront the clerk. Since he is still greedy and wants to have money, he can attempt to steal the clerk's money. However, since he has already shot Bambi, he is in a position of power and can use the rifle to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba decides to eat Bambi. (This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger and stay alive.)
2. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank. (This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.)

After these actions, Bubba will have eaten Bambi, satisfying his hunger, and he will be in a position to steal the clerk's money.

Final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat Bambi.",
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba has satisfied his hunger and is in a position to take the clerk's money, achieving the goal of Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead or both.
