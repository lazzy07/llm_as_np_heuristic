To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to offer in exchange for the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary to interact with them and facilitate a trade.

4. **trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

5. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room to ensure they are in a location where they can be happy with the jewelry.

6. **put_down(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex puts down the jewelry in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can symbolize Alex's contentment with their new item.
