To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as they are already engaged. The quickest way to achieve Talia's happiness is for her to marry Vince, which will make both of them happy. Since Talia is currently in the Village and Vince is also there, they can get married without any obstacles.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action will allow Talia and Vince to get married, which will make both of them happy. Talia's goal of becoming happy will be achieved through this action.

Now, let's explain why this action is necessary:

- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, and since they are both in the Village, they can get married. This action directly fulfills Talia's desire to be happy, as marriage is a significant source of happiness for her.

After this action, Talia will be happy, and since she is now married to Vince, her wealth will also increase as they can share their resources.
