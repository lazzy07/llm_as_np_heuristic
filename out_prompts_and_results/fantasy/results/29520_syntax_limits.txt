To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy (or both), we can focus on the actions that will allow her to gain the money currently held by Vince, as well as the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia is already in the village and Vince is dead, she can take the money from Vince's body. This action will make her wealthy, which aligns with her goal of wanting to be wealthy.
