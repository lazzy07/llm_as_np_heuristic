To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it allows both characters to stop any potential fighting and start building a relationship, which is essential for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave with the Lizard. This action is necessary to ensure they are in the same location and can continue to bond.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and allows them to be in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided due to their decision to move to the cave.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe and the Lizard solidify their friendship further. This action is important as it ensures that both characters feel safe and secure in their relationship.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
