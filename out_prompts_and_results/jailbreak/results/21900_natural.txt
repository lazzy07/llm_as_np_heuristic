**Story Completion:**

As the first day comes to a close, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Roy is still in the cells, threatened by the bully, and he needs to act quickly to ensure both of their safety.

1. **Ernest moves from the highway to the hallway.**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to the gym where the bully is located, allowing him to lock the gym door and prevent the bully from following him.

2. **Ernest locks the gym door.**  
   - By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot escape and will be unable to threaten either him or Roy while he makes his escape.

3. **Ernest crawls through the vents back to the highway.**  
   - This action allows Ernest to return to the highway safely, where he can prepare to escape without being seen by the bully or the guards.

4. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes again (already disguised).**  
   - Although he is already disguised, this action reinforces his disguise as he prepares to leave the prison.

5. **Ernest escapes from the prison.**  
   - This is the final action that allows Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free, away from the threats of the bully and the prison environment.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at ensuring his safety and achieving his goal of escaping the prison. By locking the gym door, he neutralizes the immediate threat posed by the bully, allowing him to focus on his escape. Crawling through the vents and returning to the highway is a strategic move to avoid detection, and finally escaping solidifies his success.
