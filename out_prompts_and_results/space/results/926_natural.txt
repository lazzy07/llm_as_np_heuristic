Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, both aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and their friendship is a crucial element in ensuring their safety. 

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting, she can escape the immediate threat.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** The Lizard, now alone on the surface, recognizes the danger and decides to retreat to the cave, which is a safer location. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being safe.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event occurs after both characters have moved to safety, ensuring that neither is harmed. The eruption is a natural consequence of the setting but does not affect the characters since they are no longer on the surface.

4. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** After the eruption, Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard, demonstrating her desire to maintain their friendship and ensure the Lizard is safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** This action reinforces their friendship and mutual goal of being healthy and safe. They both express their commitment to each other and their desire to be friends.

Through these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also solidifying their friendship.
