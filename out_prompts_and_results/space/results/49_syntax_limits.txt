Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself in a cave on the surface of the planet, where she encounters the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are healthy and safe, but they have not yet established a friendship. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard to ensure a peaceful coexistence and to explore the planet together.

To achieve her goal, Zoe decides to make peace with the Lizard.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Zoe initiates a peaceful interaction with the Lizard, establishing a friendship.
