To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the bathroom (R12) and does not have the flowers, while the flowers are with Casey (C3) in the living room (R12). 

The simplest action that can be taken to achieve Alex's goal is for Casey to give the flowers to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will complete the story:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the bathroom.

After this action, Alex will have the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This action is necessary because it allows Casey, who currently has the flowers, to give them to Alex, who wants them. By doing this, Alex will become happy, fulfilling their goal.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
