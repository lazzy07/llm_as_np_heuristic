To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Blake currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Blake helps Alex achieve their goal of happiness.

2. **Casey moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's goal but helps to set up the next actions for Blake and Casey, as they both want different items. It allows Casey to potentially pursue their own happiness later.

3. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to search for the chocolates, which he wants. It also keeps the story flowing as characters move around.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to achieve his own happiness, as he wants the chocolates.

5. **Casey moves to the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to be in the same room as Alex, which is important for the next action.

6. **Casey tells Alex that the jewelry is wanted.**  
   - This action is a lie, as Casey actually wants the jewelry. However, it helps to create a dynamic where Alex is aware of Casey's desires, which can lead to future interactions.

At the end of these actions, Alex has the flowers and is happy, while Blake has the chocolates and Casey has the jewelry.
