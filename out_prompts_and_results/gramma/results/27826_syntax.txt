To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of his coin. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Crossroads with a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit can access the Merchant's items, including the medicine, which she can later use to distract or manipulate others.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by robbing Tom and then taking the coins from the chest at the camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step to increase the Bandit's coin count, which is essential for her goal.
- **Walking to the Market**: This action allows the Bandit to be in a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially gather more resources.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has coins in her possession, fulfilling her goal.
