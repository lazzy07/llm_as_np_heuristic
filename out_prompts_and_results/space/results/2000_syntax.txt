To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary for her to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for building a friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: If the Lizard agrees to make peace, it will walk to the cave. This action signifies that the Lizard is also willing to be friends and is safe to move to a less dangerous location.

4. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe location, further solidifying their friendship.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe will again attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters feel safe and healthy.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
