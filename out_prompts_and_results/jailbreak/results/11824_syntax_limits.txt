**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest, feeling threatened by the bully, decides to take action. He knows that he has the pack of cigarettes, which the bully wants, and he also has a knife. To ensure his safety and to avoid confrontation, he makes a strategic decision.

Ernest moves to the hallway, where he can access the gym. He locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from threatening him or Roy further. With the bully locked away, Ernest feels a sense of relief and safety.

Now that the bully is contained, Ernest can focus on his next steps. He puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry, disguising himself. With the disguise on, he crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once he reaches the highway, he escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
