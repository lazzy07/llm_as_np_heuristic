To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Ross is currently in the admissions room and needs to be assessed to understand his condition.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to exam room B. This is important to ensure that Ross can be treated for his symptoms.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand Young's condition and ensure he receives appropriate treatment.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit him to exam room C. This is important for the same reason as admitting Ross, to ensure he can be treated.

5. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway will treat Jones in exam room A with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. Since Jones has SymptomA, which corresponds to Flaze, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway will treat Ross in exam room B with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. Since Ross has SymptomA, he will also be treated with antibiotics, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy.

7. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young in exam room C with the appropriate treatment for his symptoms. Since Young has SymptomB, he will be treated with steroids, ensuring that Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, all patients will be treated correctly, and Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
