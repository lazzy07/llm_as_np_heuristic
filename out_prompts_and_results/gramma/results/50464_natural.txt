To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can secure her coins in the chest.

2. **The bandit places the hero's coin into the chest.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit has successfully stored the coin she stole from the hero, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The story is short because the bandit only needs to return to her camp and store the coin to achieve her objective. The other characters do not interfere with her actions, and the bandit does not need to engage in any further conflict or theft.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
