After locking the gym door, Roy realizes he has the knife and the opportunity to confront the bully. He knows that the bully has threatened both him and Ernest, and he cannot let that continue. With determination, Roy decides to take revenge on the bully.

Roy approaches the bully, who is unaware of the danger he is in. In a swift motion, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened. With the bully out of the way, Roy feels a sense of relief and safety.

Now that the bully is dead, Roy can focus on escaping the prison. He takes a moment to gather himself and then heads to the hallway, where he can crawl through the vents to reach the highway. Once on the highway, he puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself for a successful escape.
