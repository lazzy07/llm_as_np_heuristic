In the bank, the Villain has successfully threatened the Hero, instilling fear in them. The Villain then coerces the Hero into wanting the money to be given to the Villain, leveraging the Hero's fear. The Hero, now under the Villain's influence, gives the money to the Villain, allowing the Villain to gain control over the President through the money.

1. **Coerce(Hero, Villain, Money)**: The Villain uses their power to manipulate the Hero into wanting the money to go to them. This action is crucial as it establishes the Villain's control over the Hero's intentions regarding the money.
  
2. **Give(Hero, Villain, Money)**: The Hero, now coerced, gives the money to the Villain. This action is necessary for the Villain to achieve their goal of controlling the President, as they need the money to bribe or influence the President.

With these actions, the Villain successfully manipulates the situation to gain control over the President through the money.
