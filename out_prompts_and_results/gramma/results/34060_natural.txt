To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to reach his desired location, the cottage.

2. **Tom carries the medicine.**  
   - This is already established in the current situation, so it remains unchanged as Tom's goal is to have the medicine with him at the cottage.

The story is very short because Tom's goal is straightforward, and he only needs to walk to the cottage to achieve it. The other characters' actions are irrelevant to Tom's goal, so they do not need to be included.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking from the crossroads to the cottage:** This is the only action Tom needs to take to fulfill his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.
