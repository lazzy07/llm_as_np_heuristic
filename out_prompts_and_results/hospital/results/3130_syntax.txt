To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat both Jones and Young, who are currently in exam rooms A and B, respectively. Ross is still in the admissions room and needs to be admitted to an exam room before he can be assessed and treated. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Hathaway achieving their goal:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine if he has any symptoms. Since Young is in Exam Room A, this action is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: Hathaway will admit Ross to an exam room (Exam Room C) so that he can be assessed and treated. This is necessary as Ross is currently in the admissions room.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

5. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
