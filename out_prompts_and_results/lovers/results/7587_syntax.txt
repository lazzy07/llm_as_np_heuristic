To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey and Blake are located (R22). This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but can be included for narrative flow.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which means Alex is happy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Blake to receive the jewelry.
2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex returns to the bedroom, completing the story.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
