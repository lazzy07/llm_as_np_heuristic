In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Given the current situation, Rory has already accepted Talia's marriage proposal, which makes them happy. Rory also possesses the treasure, which contributes to their wealth. However, Rory is currently in the cave with Talia and Gargax, and Vince is in the village with the money.

To achieve Rory's goal, the most efficient action is for Rory to travel to the village to take the money from Vince. This will make Rory wealthy and fulfill their goal of not being hungry, as they can then use the money to buy food if needed.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the cave to the village to take the money from Vince.

This action is necessary because it allows Rory to obtain the money, which is essential for achieving their goal of being wealthy and not hungry.

### Final Plan
```json

  "plan": ["travel(Rory, Cave, Village)"]
