To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3) and will not be happy, but this does not affect Alex's goal.
- Blake (C2) will still be in possession of the flowers (I2) and will also not be happy, but again, this does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
