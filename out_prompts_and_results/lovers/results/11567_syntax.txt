To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Blake (C2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with it.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates. This action is necessary because Alex needs to have an item to offer in exchange for the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) where Blake and Casey are. This is necessary to interact with Blake, who has the jewelry.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates to Blake. This action is necessary as it allows Alex to trade for the jewelry.

5. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, achieving their goal of happiness.
