The bandit, armed with her sword and holding the medicine, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is not a criminal and is armed, the bandit decides to take a risk. She approaches the hero and, with a swift motion, she attacks him, hoping to eliminate him and secure her position.

The bandit attacks the hero, successfully killing him. With the hero dead, the bandit can now loot the hero's sword and any coins he may have had. However, since the hero had no coins, the bandit only takes the sword. Now, with the hero out of the way, the bandit can return to the bandit camp with the medicine and her newly acquired sword, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
