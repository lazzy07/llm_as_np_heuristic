Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit Young to an exam room. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.**  
   - Dr. Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is now in Patient Room C. This action allows Hathaway to reach the new patient.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.**  
   - This is crucial to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to assess to find out if Young has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway treats Young with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Since Ross is still in Admissions and has unknown symptoms, Hathaway assumes he has a fever (the symptom of Flaze) and treats him with antibiotics. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both Young and Ross, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
