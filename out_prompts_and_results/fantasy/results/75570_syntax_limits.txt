To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the fact that Talia has accepted Vince's proposal, which means they can get married. Since Talia's happiness is tied to her relationship with Vince, marrying him will make her happy. 

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This action will result in Talia and Vince getting married, which will make Talia happy.

This action is necessary because Talia's happiness is directly linked to her relationship with Vince, and since they are already engaged, the next logical step is to marry. 

After this action, Talia will be happy, fulfilling the goal of the story.
