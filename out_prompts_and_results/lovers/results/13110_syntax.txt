To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bedroom where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is important because it allows Casey to build goodwill with Alex, which may lead to a favorable outcome for both.

3. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex trades the jewelry (I3) they have for the flowers (I1) that Casey just gave them. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Casey receiving the jewelry they want.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Blake is located. This is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but could be a step towards ensuring Blake's happiness as well.

5. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Blake. This action is included to ensure that Blake is happy, as Casey also wants Blake to be happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Casey moves to the bedroom** to interact with Alex.
- **Casey gives flowers to Alex** to create a positive interaction.
- **Alex trades jewelry for flowers** to fulfill Casey's desire for jewelry.
- **Casey moves back to the living room** to maintain social connections.
- **Casey gives jewelry to Blake** to ensure Blake's happiness.

At the end of these actions, Casey is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
