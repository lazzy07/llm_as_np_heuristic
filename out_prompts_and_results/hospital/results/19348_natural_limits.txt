Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A from Admissions. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Then, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Young is also experiencing Unknown, but Hathaway is still able to treat Jones based on the assumption that he has Flaze, as it is the only disease that could be treated with antibiotics.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics in Patient Room B. Since Jones is treated correctly, he becomes healthy. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated one patient, and the story ends with Hathaway achieving their goal of ensuring patients are healthy.
