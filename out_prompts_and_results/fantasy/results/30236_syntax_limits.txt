In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness. However, he currently has no money or treasure, which means he is not wealthy. To achieve his goal, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Rory achieve his goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory will travel to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for him to access the treasure.

2. **Pickup the Treasure**: Once at the cave, Rory will pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy.

After these actions, Rory will have achieved his goal of being happy (due to his marriage to Talia), wealthy (by acquiring the treasure), and not hungry (as he is not currently hungry).

- **Travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action allows Rory to reach the location of the treasure, which is crucial for him to become wealthy.
