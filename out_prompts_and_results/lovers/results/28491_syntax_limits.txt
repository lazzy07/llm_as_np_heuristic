In the current situation, Casey is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are located in the dining room (R12). To achieve their goal of happiness, Casey needs to obtain the chocolates. 

Since Alex (C1) is already happy with the jewelry (I1) they received from Casey, they can help Casey by telling Blake (C2) that Casey wants the chocolates. This will prompt Blake to take action to help Casey.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **tell(C1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that Casey wants the chocolates. This action is necessary because it informs Blake of Casey's desire, which may motivate Blake to help Casey.

2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pick up the chocolates. This action is necessary for Blake to access the item that Casey wants.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the dining room. This action is essential for Blake to have the item that Casey desires.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have received the chocolates they wanted.
