Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, enters the bank with the intention of getting money. He approaches the bank clerk, who is currently holding 1 money. Bubba, wanting to satisfy his hunger and greed, decides to use the rifle he picked up earlier. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to threaten the clerk.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money without any resistance from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.** (Bubba leaves the bank with the stolen money to avoid any potential consequences.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of having 1 money.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Stealing the money**: This directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring 1 money.
- **Going to the forest**: This action allows Bubba to escape the bank after achieving his goal, ensuring he is not caught.
