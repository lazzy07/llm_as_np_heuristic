Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are seen and treated. After admitting Jones, Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C and finds that Jones has no symptoms, which is unknown but indicates they are healthy. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room B to assess Ross. Upon assessment, Hathaway finds that Ross also has no symptoms, indicating they are healthy as well. 

With all patients either treated or assessed as healthy, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
