1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the cave. This action is necessary for the Lizard to find a safe place away from the dangers of the surface, especially since the surface is currently dangerous.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard into the cave. This action is important for Zoe to ensure that she is with the Lizard, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring both characters are safe together.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can reaffirm their friendship in a safe environment. This action solidifies their bond and ensures that both characters feel secure and healthy.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
