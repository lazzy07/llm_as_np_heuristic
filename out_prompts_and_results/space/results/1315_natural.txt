Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is dangerous due to the potential eruption of the volcano. To ensure their safety and health, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where it is safe. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intention, supports her decision, knowing that they can continue their friendship from a safe distance.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous. By teleporting, she avoids the risk of the volcano erupting.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** - The Lizard chooses to return to the cave, which is a safer location on the planet. This action reflects the Lizard's desire to stay safe while still being close to Zoe.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard maintain their friendship.** - Even though they are in different locations, they can still communicate and support each other, ensuring that both characters feel safe and healthy.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe, while also maintaining her friendship with the Lizard.
