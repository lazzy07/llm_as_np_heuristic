Tom, wanting to be at the cottage carrying the medicine, realizes that the merchant has the medicine at the bandit camp. To achieve his goal, he decides to take action.

1. **Tom walks from the camp to the crossroads.** (This action is necessary for Tom to get closer to the merchant and the medicine.)
2. **Tom reports the location of the bandit to the guard.** (By reporting the bandit, Tom ensures that the guard can take action against the bandit, which will allow Tom to safely retrieve the medicine from the merchant.)

After reporting the bandit, the guard, believing the bandit is at the camp, will take action to confront the bandit. This will create a distraction, allowing Tom to approach the merchant and obtain the medicine without any threat.

Finally, Tom can walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the crossroads**: This is essential for Tom to move towards the merchant and the medicine.
- **Reporting the bandit**: This action is crucial as it sets off a chain reaction that will allow Tom to safely obtain the medicine.
