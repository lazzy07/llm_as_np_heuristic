In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered together. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is happy with the jewelry. 

To help Blake achieve their goal, Casey decides to put down the jewelry they are holding. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to see that the jewelry is available for trade or to be given away. 

Next, Blake picks up the chocolates from the bathroom, which they believe are there. This action is essential for Blake to obtain the item they desire.

Finally, Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in exchange for the jewelry. This action allows Blake to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the chocolates.
