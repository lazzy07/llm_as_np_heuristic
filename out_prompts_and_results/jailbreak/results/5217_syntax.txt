**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Ernest knows he needs to act quickly. He has the knife and is aware that the bully is a threat to both him and Roy. Since the gym is locked, the bully cannot escape, and this gives Ernest a chance to confront him.

1. **revenge(Ernest, Bully, Gym)**: Ernest decides to take action against the bully. He uses the knife to kill the bully in the gym. This action is crucial because it eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to feel safe.
