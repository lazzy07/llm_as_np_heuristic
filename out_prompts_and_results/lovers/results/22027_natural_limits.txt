In the dining room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex, who wants the flowers, sees that they are with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to tell Blake that Casey wants the chocolates, which is a lie. This action is intended to create a distraction and prompt Blake to give Alex the chocolates, which Blake believes Alex wants.

1. **Alex tells Blake that Casey wants the chocolates.** (This action is a lie but is intended to manipulate Blake into thinking that Casey is interested in the chocolates, which may lead to a trade or a gift.)

After this action, the dynamics shift, and Blake, believing that Casey wants the chocolates, may feel inclined to give them to Alex, thus allowing Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the flowers from Casey.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **Telling a lie about Casey wanting the chocolates**: This is a strategic move by Alex to redirect Blake's attention and potentially create an opportunity for Alex to get the flowers. Since Alex is not happy and wants the flowers, this action is necessary to influence Blake's decision-making.
