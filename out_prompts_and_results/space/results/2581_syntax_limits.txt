In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is on the surface of the planet. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe, wanting to ensure her safety and the safety of the Lizard, decides to teleport to the surface to warn the Lizard about the impending danger. However, the Lizard, feeling threatened by Zoe's sudden appearance, prepares to attack. 

To prevent a fight and to establish a friendship, Zoe quickly makes peace with the Lizard, explaining that she is there to help. The Lizard, realizing that Zoe means no harm, agrees to be friends. However, as they are making peace, the volcano erupts, and the Lizard, still on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies.

The actions taken are as follows:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to warn the Lizard about the volcano, which is a necessary action to fulfill her goal of ensuring safety.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard to avoid conflict and establish a friendship, which is essential for both characters' goals of making friends.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's demise, which is a critical event that concludes the story.

The story ends with the Lizard dying due to the eruption while Zoe successfully makes peace with the Lizard before the eruption occurs.
