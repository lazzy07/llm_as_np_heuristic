The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the crossroads with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where the guard is stationed. The bandit knows that the guard believes she is at the crossroads, so she uses this to her advantage. 

Once at the market, the bandit reports her own location to the guard, misleading him into thinking she is still at the crossroads. This allows her to create a diversion. While the guard is distracted, the bandit quickly returns to the crossroads, where the merchant is still present. 

At the crossroads, the bandit draws her sword and robs the merchant, taking the medicine from her. With the medicine in hand, the bandit now has what she needs to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she can now sell the medicine for coins later.
