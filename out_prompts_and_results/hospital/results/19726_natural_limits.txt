3. **Admit Ross to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room B, where he can be assessed later. This action is necessary to manage her workload and ensure that all patients are attended to.

By taking these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
