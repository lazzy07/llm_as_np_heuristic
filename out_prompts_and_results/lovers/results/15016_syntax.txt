To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey (C3) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) will have the chocolates (I3).
- Casey (C3) will still have the flowers (I2) and will not be happy.

This single trade action is sufficient to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
