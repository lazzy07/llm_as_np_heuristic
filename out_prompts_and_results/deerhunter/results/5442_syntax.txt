To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money while also considering the other characters and their states. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up to shoot the clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants to eliminate the clerk to take all the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba goes back to the forest. This is necessary for him to escape the scene and avoid any potential consequences.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba finds Bambi in the forest and decides to eat her. This action satisfies his hunger, which is a goal he has alongside his greed for money.
