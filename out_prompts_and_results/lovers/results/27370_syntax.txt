To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey (C2) will trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1) that is in the same room (R22). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3) and will still want the flowers (I2), but that does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, fulfilling their goal of happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
