To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money in the bank.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba will go to the forest to find Bambi and eat her. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the condition of the story.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome with minimal actions.

### Explanation of Actions:
