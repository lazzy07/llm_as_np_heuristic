In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Ross, who is already assigned to Exam Room A and has a symptom (SymptomA) that Hathaway has assessed. Jones and Young are in the admissions room, and their symptoms are unknown.

To achieve the goal of making all patients healthy, Hathaway can take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: This action allows Hathaway to assign Young to an exam room where they can be assessed later. It increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable and avoids the risk of making a mistake.

2. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Since Jones is still in the admissions room, Hathaway can assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because knowing Jones's symptoms will allow Hathaway to treat them appropriately.

After these actions, Hathaway can treat both Ross and Jones based on their symptoms, ensuring they both become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to ensure that Young is assigned to an exam room where Hathaway can later assess them. It keeps Hathaway's workload manageable and allows for the possibility of treatment.

2. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, SymptomJ, Admissions)**: This action is essential to determine Jones's symptoms. Once Hathaway knows what Jones is suffering from, they can provide the correct treatment, ensuring Jones's health.

By taking these actions, Hathaway can effectively manage their workload and ensure that both Ross and Jones receive the necessary treatment, achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.
