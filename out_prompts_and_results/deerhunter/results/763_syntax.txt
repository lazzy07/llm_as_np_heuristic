To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest after having shot and eaten Bambi. He is aware that the bank clerk has money, and he believes the clerk is alive. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Go from Forest to Bank**: Bubba needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located to obtain the money.
2. **Steal money from the Clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can threaten the clerk and steal the money.

Now, let's break down the actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the clerk is, allowing him to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of obtaining money in the shortest possible way, given the constraints of the story.
