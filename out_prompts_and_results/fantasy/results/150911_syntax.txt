To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her actions in the cave and her relationship with Rory. Since Talia has already proposed to Rory and he has not yet accepted, we can have her take the treasure from the cave and then return to the village to marry Rory, which will make her happy.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary because Talia wants to be wealthy, and the treasure will increase her wealth.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure. This is essential for her to be in the same location as Rory to propose marriage.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. This action is crucial because it fulfills Talia's desire for happiness through a loving relationship.

Now, Talia has both the treasure (wealth) and a happy relationship with Rory, achieving her goals.
