To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will reflect the characters' goals of safety and friendship, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano has already begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is necessary to set the stage for the impending eruption.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)**: Zoe and the Lizard are already on the surface, so they can interact directly. This action allows them to be in the same location and continue their conversation, which is essential for building their friendship.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard are already friends, but this action solidifies their friendship. It shows that they are working together to ensure their safety and to understand each other better.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a necessary conclusion to the story. This action results in the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

In this sequence, the characters achieve their goals of friendship while the volcano erupts, leading to a dramatic conclusion.
