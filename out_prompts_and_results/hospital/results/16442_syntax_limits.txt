**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, realizing their workload is high, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. Young shows no symptoms, so Hathaway believes Young is healthy.
2. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway then assesses Jones in Exam Room B. Jones shows symptoms of Flaze (fever).
3. **Treat Jones**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze.

Now, Hathaway has successfully treated one patient, reducing their workload and ensuring that Jones is healthy. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to determine if Young has any symptoms that need treatment. Since Young is healthy, it allows Hathaway to focus on the other patients.
- **Assess Jones**: This action is crucial as it identifies Jones's condition (Flaze), which requires treatment.
- **Treat Jones**: This action is essential to ensure Jones becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of having all patients healthy.
