**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite her heavy workload, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. She enters the room and examines Jones, who is showing symptoms of an unknown condition. Due to her workload being three, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with steroids, the treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, the treatment fails, and Jones dies. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway, still at Patient Room A, realizes she needs to address the other patients. She walks to Admissions to assess Ross. Upon entering, she assesses Ross, who is also showing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. This time, the treatment is correct, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young. She assesses Young, who is showing unknown symptoms. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis and treats him with steroids. Young dies.

In the end, only Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, while Jones and Young do not.
