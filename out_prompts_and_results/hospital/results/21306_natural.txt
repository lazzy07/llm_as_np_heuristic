**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room C. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the admissions room to assess Ross and Young.

3. **Walk from Patient Room C to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Ross and Young.

4. **Admit Ross to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room A, increasing her workload to 2.

5. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B, increasing her workload to 3.

6. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

7. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

8. **Assess Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis.

9. **Treat Young in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, despite her mistakes, lead to the conclusion that all patients are now deceased, which is not her goal. However, she has completed her assessments and treatments.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is necessary to assess and treat the patients, even though the high workload leads to mistakes.
- The assessments are crucial to determine the conditions of the patients, and the treatments are necessary to attempt to cure them.
