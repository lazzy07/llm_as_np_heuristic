To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the money that the clerk has. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk without any repercussions.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will take the money from the clerk. This action is essential as it fulfills Bubba's greed and ensures he has the money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will leave the bank and go to the forest. This action is included to show that Bubba is escaping the scene after committing the crime.

The story is concise and directly leads to the outcome where Bubba has the money, fulfilling the requirement of the ending.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the threat posed by the clerk and take the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to acquire the money after the clerk has been shot.
