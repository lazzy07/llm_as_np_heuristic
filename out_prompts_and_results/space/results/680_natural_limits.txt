Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to take action to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there are any other creatures that might need help. This action is necessary for her to understand the danger and potentially make more friends.

2. **The volcano erupts.** - As Zoe is on the surface, the volcano erupts, creating a hazardous environment. This event is crucial as it leads to the next action.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - Unfortunately, Zoe does not escape the eruption in time, leading to her demise. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying in the story.

The story ends with Zoe's death due to the eruption, while the Lizard remains safe in the cave. The Lizard, having made a friend in Zoe, now feels a sense of loss but also a commitment to protect the planet and its creatures, ensuring that Zoe's spirit lives on in their friendship.
