**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Ernest, now on the highway, realizes he needs to disguise himself to ensure his safety and escape. He quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry room. This action is crucial because it allows him to blend in and avoid being recognized as a prisoner.

Meanwhile, Roy, still in the cells, is aware of the bully's threats and knows he needs to act quickly. He decides to sneak through the vents to the gym, where he can confront the bully. However, since the gym door is locked, he cannot access it directly. Instead, he waits for the right moment to make a move.

Ernest, now disguised, feels a surge of confidence. He knows he must escape before the bully realizes he is not in the kitchen. He heads towards the highway, where he can finally leave the prison. This action is essential as it leads him to freedom.

On the second day, Roy, still in the cells, decides to take a risk. He sneaks through the vents to the hallway, then makes his way to the kitchen to retrieve the knife. This is a critical action because it gives him a means to defend himself against the bully if necessary.

Once Roy has the knife, he heads back to the gym, where he finds the door still locked. He uses the knife to unlock the door, allowing him to confront the bully. This confrontation is necessary for both characters to ensure their safety.

In the gym, Roy faces the bully. With the knife in hand, he manages to overpower the bully, killing him. This action is vital as it removes the threat that has been looming over both him and Ernest.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely join Ernest on the highway. They both escape together, achieving their goal of staying alive and free.
