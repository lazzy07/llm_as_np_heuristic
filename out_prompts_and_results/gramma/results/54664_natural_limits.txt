The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the hero at the market. Knowing that the hero is unarmed and has just been robbed of the medicine, she decides to take advantage of the situation. The bandit approaches the hero and, with a swift motion, she attacks and kills him. 

After the hero falls, the bandit loots the hero's corpse, taking the medicine that she had previously stolen from him. With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit returns to her camp, satisfied that she has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as she can, as she can now also sell the medicine for more coins.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Attack and kill the hero**: The bandit is armed and the hero is not, making this action possible. This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate the hero and take the medicine.
2. **Loot the hero's corpse**: After killing the hero, the bandit takes the medicine from him, which is essential for her goal of carrying valuable items.
