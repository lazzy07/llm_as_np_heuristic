To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will be taken:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially obtain the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

3. **put_down(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story consistent with the characters' actions and desires.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room (R22). This action is included to show Blake's movement and involvement in the story, even though it does not directly affect Alex's happiness.

5. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room (R22). This action is also included to show Casey's movement and involvement in the story.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the flowers they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to receive the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This is the key action that makes Alex happy by giving them the item they want.
- **put_down(C3, I2, R21)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it shows Casey's action and keeps the narrative flowing.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)** and **move(C3, R21, R22)**: These actions show the movement of Blake and Casey, maintaining the story's continuity.
