To achieve Indiana Jones's goal of ensuring the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, the following actions will take place:

1. **travel(Nazis, Tanis, USA)**: The Nazis, believing the Ark is with Jones, will travel to the USA to confront him and retrieve the Ark. This action is necessary because they want to take the Ark from Jones.

2. **take(Nazis, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: The Nazis will attempt to take the Ark from the US Army by force. This action is crucial as it shows the Nazis' aggressive intent to claim the Ark for themselves.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, USA)**: The US Army, now in possession of the Ark, will open it. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army personnel who opened it. However, this action is necessary to ensure that the Ark cannot be used by the Nazis.

4. **travel(Jones, USA, Tanis)**: After the US Army is eliminated, Jones will travel back to Tanis to ensure the Ark remains out of Nazi hands. This action is necessary for Jones to secure the Ark's location.

5. **dig(Jones, Ark, Tanis)**: Jones will dig up the Ark again in Tanis. This action is necessary to reclaim the Ark and ensure it is not used by the Nazis.

6. **travel(Jones, Tanis, USA)**: Finally, Jones will travel back to the USA with the Ark. This action is necessary to fulfill his goal of ensuring the Ark is with the US Army, even if they are no longer alive.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that the Ark is ultimately secured by Jones, preventing the Nazis from achieving their goal of immortality through the Ark.
