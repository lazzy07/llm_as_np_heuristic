Zoe, the space explorer, is on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are currently safe and healthy, but the surface is dangerous. To ensure their safety and to foster friendship, Zoe decides to take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to be in the same location as the Lizard, allowing them to interact further and solidify their friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, this action reinforces their bond in a safer environment. It emphasizes their mutual desire for friendship and safety.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship. This action is taken to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous, and she can continue her exploration from the safety of her ship.

4. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface to check on the Lizard and ensure that they are both safe. This action is important for maintaining their friendship and ensuring that the Lizard is not left alone in a dangerous environment.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again on the surface, solidifying their friendship and ensuring that both characters feel safe and healthy together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
