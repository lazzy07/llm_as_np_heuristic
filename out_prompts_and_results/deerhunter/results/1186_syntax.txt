To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of getting money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle and ammunition. The bank clerk is in the bank with some money, and Bambi is also in the forest but does not pose a threat to Bubba's goal.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **Load the rifle with ammunition**: This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be armed to threaten the bank clerk and take the money. 
   - Action: `load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)`

2. **Go to the bank**: Bubba needs to move to the bank where the clerk is located to confront him and take the money.
   - Action: `go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)`

3. **Steal the money from the bank clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now threaten the clerk and take the money.
   - Action: `steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)`

4. **Decide to eat**: After successfully stealing the money, Bubba is still hungry. He can now decide to eat Bambi, who is in the forest.
   - Action: `decide_to_eat(Bubba)`

5. **Go back to the forest**: Bubba needs to return to the forest to find Bambi.
   - Action: `go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)`

6. **Eat Bambi**: Finally, Bubba can eat Bambi, satisfying his hunger.
