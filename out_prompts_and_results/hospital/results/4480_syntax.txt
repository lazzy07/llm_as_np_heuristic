To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room B**: Since Young is currently in the admissions room, Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis and to provide the appropriate treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. This will help determine Ross's symptoms and ensure that all patients are evaluated.

3. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment of Young, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure Young becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After treating Young, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat both Young and Ross, ensuring that all patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Young**: This action is necessary to identify Young's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment.
- **Treat Young**: This action is necessary to provide the correct treatment based on Young's symptoms, ensuring they become healthy.
- **Treat Ross**: This action is necessary to provide the correct treatment based on Ross's symptoms, ensuring they become healthy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomC, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, TreatmentY, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, TreatmentR, Admissions)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, "SymptomB" and "SymptomC" represent the symptoms identified during the assessments, and "TreatmentY" and "TreatmentR" represent the corresponding treatments for Young and Ross, respectively.
