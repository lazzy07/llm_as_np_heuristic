To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they end up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the dining room (R21) and has given away the jewelry.
- Casey is now in the dining room (R21) and has received the jewelry, making them happy.
- Blake remains in the living room (R22) and is still unhappy, but since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this is acceptable.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: This action is necessary for Casey to reach Alex, who has the jewelry. Without this movement, Casey cannot interact with Alex.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: This action is crucial as it directly provides Casey with the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
