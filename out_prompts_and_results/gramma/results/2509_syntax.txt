To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Merchant walks from Camp to Crossroads**: The Merchant needs to be in a location where she can interact with other characters, particularly Tom, who is at the Market.

2. **Merchant buys the medicine from herself**: The Merchant can buy the medicine from her own stock using one of the coins she has. This action allows her to keep the medicine while also ensuring she has a coin left.

3. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Market**: The Merchant needs to go to the Market to interact with Tom and potentially sell him items or trade.

4. **Merchant buys a sword from Tom using a coin**: The Merchant can buy a sword from Tom, which allows her to be armed and increases her ability to defend herself or negotiate.

5. **Merchant walks from Market to Crossroads**: After acquiring the sword, the Merchant returns to the Crossroads to position herself strategically.

6. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Camp**: Finally, the Merchant returns to her Camp, where she can safely store her items and coins.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as she does not engage in any illegal activities.
