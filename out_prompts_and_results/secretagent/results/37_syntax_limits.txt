To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent can take the following actions:

1. **Move from Cache to Office**: The secret agent needs to move to the office where the mastermind is likely to be, as the office is a logical location for the mastermind to be present.

2. **Kill the Mastermind with the Gun in the Office**: Once the secret agent is in the office, they can use the gun they picked up to kill the mastermind.
