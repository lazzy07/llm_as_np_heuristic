To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coin that Tom bought from her. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without needing to go to the bandit camp or find another source of coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coin in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully robs the Merchant and then walks to the camp, where she can store the coin. 

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit takes the coin from the Merchant, which is essential for her goal of accumulating coins.
2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit moves to the camp to secure the coin in her chest, achieving her goal.

The Bandit now has a coin in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her objective.
