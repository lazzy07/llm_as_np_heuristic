**Story Completion:**

Indiana Jones, realizing the danger of the Ark, decides to dig it up to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He successfully uncovers the Ark, but knowing it is dangerous, he does not open it. Instead, he hides it nearby, hoping to keep it out of Nazi hands. 

The Nazis, unaware of the Ark's true nature, search for it. They eventually find Indiana and demand he hand over the Ark. Indiana, knowing the Nazis want to use it for their own gain, refuses. The Nazis, armed and aggressive, attempt to take the Ark by force. 

In the ensuing struggle, Indiana manages to outsmart the Nazis and uses the environment to his advantage, leading them into a trap where they are incapacitated. With the Nazis defeated, Indiana quickly travels back to the USA to inform the U.S. Army of the Ark's location.

Once in the USA, Indiana leads the U.S. Army back to Tanis. Together, they retrieve the Ark, ensuring it is secured and kept away from those who would misuse it.
