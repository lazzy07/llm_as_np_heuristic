To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC and has a workload of 3, they will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Ross in Exam Room A**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze; if he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk back to the admissions room to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young in Admissions**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young accordingly. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment.

6. **Treat Jones in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients and achieve their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
