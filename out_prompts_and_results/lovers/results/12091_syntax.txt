To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the room where Casey and Blake are. This is important for Alex to be with the other characters after obtaining the item.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey. This action is taken because Alex wants Casey to be happy, and giving them the jewelry fulfills that desire.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as the item they want.

6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry. This action ensures that Casey now has the item they want, making them happy.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the room where Alex and Blake are. This is important for Casey to be with the other characters after obtaining the item.

8. **give(C2, I1, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action is taken because Casey wants Blake to be happy, and giving them the jewelry fulfills that desire.

9. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the room where the jewelry is located. This is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as the item they want.

10. **pick_up(C3, I1, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry. This action ensures that Blake now has the item they want, making them happy.

11. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the room where Alex and Casey are. This is important for Blake to be with the other characters after obtaining the item.

12. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry back to Alex. This action is taken because Blake wants Alex to be happy, and giving them the jewelry fulfills that desire.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, making them happy. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)",
    "move(C1, R21, R22)",
    "give(C1, I1, C2, R22)",
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C2, I1, R21)",
    "move(C2, R21, R22)",
    "give(C2, I1, C3, R22)",
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I1, R21)",
    "move(C3, R21, R22)",
    "give(C3, I1, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Alex ultimately achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry, while also considering the happiness of Casey and Blake throughout the process.
