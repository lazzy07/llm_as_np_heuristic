To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Since Jones is in Exam Room A, Hathaway should assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway should walk to the Admissions room to assess the other patients, Ross and Young, who are currently waiting there.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room A**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room A, where he can be assessed next. This is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the care he needs.

5. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms, similar to what was done for Jones.

6. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This is essential for Ross to become healthy.

7. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room B, allowing for his assessment next.

8. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

9. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
