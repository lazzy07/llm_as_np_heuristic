Dr. Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients to ensure they are healthy. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess too many patients. Therefore, Hathaway should prioritize assessing and treating one patient at a time.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Exam Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to assess Jones, who is in Exam Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway will not know the actual disease yet.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.**  
   - Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway risks treating incorrectly. However, this is the only option available to try to help Jones.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room A to Exam Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to assess Young, who is in Exam Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. Young is also experiencing Unknown.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics.**  
   - Again, this is a risk since Young's symptoms are unknown, but it is the only treatment option available.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Exam Room B to Exam Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary to assess Ross, who is in Exam Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Ross is also experiencing Unknown.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - This is a risk since Ross's symptoms are unknown, but it is the only treatment option available.

After these actions, all patients have been treated. Since the treatment was antibiotics for all, and the patients were not diagnosed with Flaze or Jarkis, we assume that they were treated correctly, and all patients become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- Each action is taken to ensure that Dr. Hathaway assesses and treats each patient in turn, despite the risk of treating without knowing their actual symptoms. The goal is to ensure all patients are healthy, and by treating them, Hathaway fulfills this goal.
