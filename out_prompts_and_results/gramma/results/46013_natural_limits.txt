The bandit, realizing that the hero is at the market and armed, decides to take a strategic approach. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she knows the hero, merchant, and guard are present. The bandit then uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine that the merchant is carrying. With the medicine in her possession, the bandit now has a valuable item that she can either keep or sell later, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can or having valuable items in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the merchant and take the medicine.
2. **Bandit robs the merchant**: This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant, which is a valuable item that contributes to her goal of carrying valuable items.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal with these two actions.
