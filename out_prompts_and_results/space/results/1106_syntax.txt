To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action has already been taken, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to begin forming a friendship with Zoe.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface of the planet can start erupting at any time. This action is necessary to create a sense of urgency for both characters to find safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave to seek shelter from the impending eruption. This action is important for Zoe to ensure her safety and to stay close to the Lizard.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave to find safety from the eruption. This action ensures that both characters are together in a safe location.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are in the cave, they remain safe. This action is necessary to fulfill the story's requirement of the volcano erupting while ensuring the characters' safety.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
