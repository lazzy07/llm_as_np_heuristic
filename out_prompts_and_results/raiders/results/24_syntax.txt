To achieve Indiana Jones's goal of ensuring the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, the following actions will take place:

1. **travel(USArmy, USA, Tanis)**: The US Army travels from the USA to Tanis to confront the Nazis and retrieve the Ark. This action is necessary because the US Army needs to be present in Tanis to claim the Ark.

2. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, Tanis)**: The US Army takes the Ark from Indiana Jones by force. This action is necessary because the US Army is armed and can assert control over the Ark, which is crucial for them to achieve their goal of possessing it.

3. **open(USArmy, Ark, Tanis)**: The US Army opens the Ark of the Covenant. Since the Ark is dangerous, this action will result in the death of the US Army members who opened it. However, the goal of ensuring the Ark is in the hands of the US Army is achieved before this consequence occurs.

The sequence of actions ensures that Indiana Jones's goal is met, as the Ark is ultimately in the possession of the US Army, even if they do not survive the opening of the Ark.
