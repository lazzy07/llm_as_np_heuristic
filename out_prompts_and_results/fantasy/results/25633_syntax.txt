To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia is currently in the cave, where the treasure is located. She has already proposed to both Rory and Vince, and both have accepted her proposals. However, she needs to secure the treasure to become wealthy.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to her wealth, which is one of her goals.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels back to the village with the treasure. This is necessary for her to be in a location where she can interact with Rory and Vince.

3. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. Since both have accepted each other's proposals, this action will make them happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

4. **marry(Talia, Vince, Village)**: Talia also marries Vince. This action will also contribute to Talia's happiness, as she has accepted his proposal as well.

By marrying both Rory and Vince, Talia achieves her goal of happiness through her relationships, and by picking up the treasure, she achieves her goal of wealth.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
