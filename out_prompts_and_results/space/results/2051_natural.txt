Zoe, feeling safe aboard her spaceship, decides to check on the Lizard, who she believes is on the surface. She teleports from the ship to the surface, but as she arrives, she realizes the surface is still dangerous due to the ongoing volcanic activity. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's arrival, walks from the cave to the surface to meet her.

Once they are together, they discuss their mutual goals of health, safety, and friendship. They both express their desire to protect each other and the planet. This conversation leads to them solidifying their friendship, as they realize they can work together to ensure their safety.

However, while they are talking, the volcano suddenly erupts. Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, must quickly teleport back to the ship to escape the danger. Zoe teleports first, and the Lizard follows suit, ensuring they both make it back safely.
