To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **Tom walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action is necessary for Tom to confront the bandit and retrieve the medicine.

2. **Tom attacks the bandit.**  
   - Since Tom is armed with the merchant's sword and the bandit is not armed with a sword, Tom can attack and kill the bandit, allowing him to take the medicine.

3. **Tom loots the medicine from the bandit's corpse.**  
   - After defeating the bandit, Tom can take the medicine, which is his goal.

4. **Tom walks from the bandit camp to the cottage.**  
   - Finally, Tom needs to return to the cottage to complete his goal of being there with the medicine.
