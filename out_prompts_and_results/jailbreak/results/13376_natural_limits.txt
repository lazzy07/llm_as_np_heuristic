On the second day, Ernest finds himself in the gym, where the bully is looming over him, still furious about the stolen cigarettes. Knowing he is threatened, Ernest decides to take a risk. He quickly scans the gym for any potential escape routes but realizes he needs a weapon to defend himself against the bully. 

Ernest remembers that the knife is in the kitchen. He knows he has to act fast. He makes a bold decision to sneak out of the gym and head to the kitchen to grab the knife. Once he has the knife, he can return to the gym and confront the bully. 

As he sneaks through the hallway, he hears the bully's voice echoing behind him, but he manages to reach the kitchen without being caught. He grabs the knife and heads back to the gym.
