**Story Completion:**

Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threat, decides to take a bold step. He sneaks out of the kitchen and moves to the hallway. From there, he crawls through the vents to the gym, where the bully is currently occupied. Once inside the gym, he locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. With the knife in hand, Ernest confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation and survival, he kills the bully. 

Now, with the threat eliminated, Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. He then makes his way back to the hallway and, disguised, he escapes through the highway outside the prison, finally achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
