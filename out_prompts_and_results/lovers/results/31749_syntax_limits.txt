In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in the room). 

Here’s the shortest story where Blake achieves their goal:

1. **trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R11)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex for the flowers (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Alex the item they want, which is I3, making both characters happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have I3 (the flowers).
- Blake is happy because they successfully helped Alex achieve happiness.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that both Blake and Alex achieve their happiness. By trading, Blake fulfills their goal of making Alex happy, which in turn makes Blake happy as well.
