To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness through marriage and wealth through acquiring treasure. Since Talia has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, she can marry one of them, which will make her happy. Additionally, she can also acquire the treasure in the cave, which will contribute to her wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve the desired outcome:

1. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Talia marries Rory, which makes her happy. This is essential because Talia's goal includes becoming happy, and marriage to Rory fulfills that requirement.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: After marrying Rory, Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure will increase her wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Talia's desire to be happy. Since she has accepted Rory's proposal, marrying him will ensure her happiness.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the treasure, which contributes to her wealth. Since she is in the cave where the treasure is located, she can easily pick it up.
