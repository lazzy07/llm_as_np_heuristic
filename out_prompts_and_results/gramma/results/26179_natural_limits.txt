The bandit, armed with her sword, stands at the crossroads, having just attacked both the guard and the merchant. With both of her opponents dead, she quickly assesses the situation. The merchant, who is now lifeless, has the medicine that the hero desires, but the banditâ€™s primary goal is to gather coins. 

1. The bandit walks to the merchant's body and loots the medicine. This action is taken because the bandit wants to ensure that she has the medicine, which could be valuable for trade or leverage later, even though her main goal is coins.

2. The bandit then walks to the chest at the bandit camp to retrieve her coins. This action is necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

With these two actions, the bandit successfully gathers the medicine and retrieves her coins, fulfilling her goal of having coins in her possession.

### Explanation of Actions:
