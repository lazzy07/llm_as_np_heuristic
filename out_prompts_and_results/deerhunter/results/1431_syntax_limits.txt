To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is hungry and greedy, decides to shoot Bambi with the rifle he picked up and loaded with ammunition. This action serves two purposes: it eliminates Bambi, who wants to be alive, and it satisfies Bubba's hunger by providing him with food.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from his actions.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: With Bambi dead and having satisfied his hunger, Bubba can now focus on his greed. He decides to go back to the bank to get the money from the bank clerk.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with food and can potentially return to the bank for money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
