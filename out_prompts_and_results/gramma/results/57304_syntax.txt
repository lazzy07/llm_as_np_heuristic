To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to leave the bandit camp with the medicine and reach the cottage safely. Hereâ€™s the shortest story:

1. **walk(Tom, Camp, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the bandit camp to head towards the cottage. The crossroads is the only path available to him from the camp.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the crossroads, Tom can now walk directly to the cottage, which is his desired location.

This sequence of actions allows Tom to successfully reach the cottage while carrying the medicine he purchased. The other characters do not interfere with Tom's actions, as they are either at the market or engaged in their own activities.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Camp, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to exit the bandit camp, where he currently is, and move towards his goal.
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to reach his final destination, the cottage, where he wants to be carrying the medicine.
