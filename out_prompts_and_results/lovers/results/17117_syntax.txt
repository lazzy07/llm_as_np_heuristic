To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the flowers (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, which will make them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I3) and will still want the chocolates (I2), but that does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want from Blake, fulfilling Alex's desire for happiness.

Now, here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I1, C1, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
