To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bubba also has a rifle loaded with ammunition, which gives him the power to take action against the clerk or Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk to take the money. This action directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the goal of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank** allows Bubba to confront the clerk, which is essential for him to achieve his goal of obtaining money.
- **Shooting the clerk** is a direct action that allows Bubba to eliminate the obstacle (the clerk) who possesses the money.
- **Picking up the money** is the final action that ensures Bubba achieves his goal of having money.
