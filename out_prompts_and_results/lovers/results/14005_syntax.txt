To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not yet in play, and we need to facilitate the exchange of items among the characters to achieve this.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R12) to the dining room (R21). This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake, allowing for potential item exchanges.

2. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey tells Blake that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic lie because Casey actually wants the jewelry (I2), but this misinformation can help facilitate a trade.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the bedroom (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and potentially trade items.

4. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the flowers (I1) they have for the jewelry (I2) that Alex has. This action directly fulfills Blake's goal of obtaining the item they want.

5. **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex puts down the chocolates (I3) in the bedroom (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to clear the space and allows for future interactions.

6. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to be closer to Casey and Blake. This action is not necessary for Blake's happiness but helps to maintain the social dynamics.

At the end of these actions, Blake has the jewelry (I2) and is happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to facilitate communication and potential item exchanges.
- **tell(C3, C2, I2, R21)**: Casey's lie about wanting chocolates creates a scenario where Blake might feel compelled to trade.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to trade items.
- **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: This is the critical action where Blake gets the jewelry they want, making them happy.
- **put_down(C1, I3, R22)**: While not necessary for Blake's happiness, it helps to keep the environment organized.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action helps maintain the social interaction among the characters.
