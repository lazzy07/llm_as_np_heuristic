To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to obtain money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest, hungry, and has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is at the bank with some money, and Bambi is also in the forest. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary because he needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for him to escape the bank after committing the theft.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, which is a natural action since he is hungry. This action is not directly related to his goal of obtaining money but is necessary for his survival.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi, which is a deer in the forest. This action satisfies his hunger and is a consequence of his earlier decision to eat.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves to the location where the money is.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Acquires the money from the clerk, achieving his goal.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Returns to safety after the theft.
- **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Acknowledges his hunger.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies his hunger by consuming Bambi.
