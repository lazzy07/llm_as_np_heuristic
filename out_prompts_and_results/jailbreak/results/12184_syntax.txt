**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores, Roy, who is in the kitchen, decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and is a threat to them both. 

1. **Go to Hall**: Roy moves from the kitchen to the hallway to get closer to the gym where the bully is located. This action is necessary to position himself for the next steps.
