To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must take the following actions:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. This is necessary because the agent needs to confront the mastermind, who is believed to be in the same location.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the lobby. This action directly fulfills the goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The secret agent needs to move to the lobby to confront the mastermind. The agent believes the mastermind is in the office, but since the agent is already in the office, this action is necessary to reach the lobby where the confrontation will occur.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind. This is the ultimate goal of the secret agent, ensuring that the mastermind is dead.

The actions are minimal and directly lead to the desired outcome of the mastermind being dead.
