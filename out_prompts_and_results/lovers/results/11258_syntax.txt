To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex is in the dining room (R21), and the jewelry is in the dining room (R22) where Casey is located. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room to the living room where Casey is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
