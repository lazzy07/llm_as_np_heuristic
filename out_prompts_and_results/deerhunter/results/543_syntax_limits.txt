To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba will load the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs a loaded gun to either threaten the bank clerk or to hunt Bambi.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba will steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba will shoot Bambi in the forest. This action fulfills the condition of Bambi being dead.
