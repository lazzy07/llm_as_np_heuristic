In this story, the Bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. The Bandit has already robbed Tom of a coin and has a sword, making her a threat to the Merchant and Tom. 

To achieve her goal, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **Take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the BanditCoin location and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins secured in her camp.

This action is sufficient because it directly fulfills the Bandit's objective of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp without needing to engage in further conflict or actions.
