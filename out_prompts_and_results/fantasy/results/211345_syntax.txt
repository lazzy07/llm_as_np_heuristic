To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to secure wealth and happiness while avoiding hunger. Given the current situation, Rory has already picked up the treasure and is in the village. He has a relationship with Talia, who has accepted his proposal. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory needs to return to the cave to be with Talia and potentially propose marriage again, as he is currently not married to her.
   
2. **Propose marriage to Talia**: Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal before, he can propose again to solidify their relationship and ensure they are married.

3. **Accept the proposal from Rory**: Talia will accept Rory's proposal, leading to their marriage.

4. **Marry Talia**: This action will make both Rory and Talia happy, fulfilling Rory's happiness requirement.

5. **Pickup Money from Vince**: Since Rory is in the village and Vince is also there with the money, Rory can take the money from Vince, increasing his wealth.

6. **Get Hungry**: This action is not necessary for Rory to achieve his goal, but it can be included to show that he is aware of his hunger status.

7. **Eat**: Rory can eat to satisfy his hunger, ensuring he is not hungry anymore.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to be with Talia to propose marriage.
- **Propose(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: Rory proposes to Talia to solidify their relationship.
- **Accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal, leading to happiness for both.
- **Marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action makes both characters happy.
- **Take(Rory, Money, Vince, Village)**: Rory takes the money from Vince, increasing his wealth.
- **Get_Hungry(Rory)**: Rory acknowledges his hunger status.
- **Eat(Rory, Rory, Village)**: Rory eats to satisfy his hunger.

After these actions, Rory will be happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
