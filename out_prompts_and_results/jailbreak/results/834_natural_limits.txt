Ernest, realizing that Roy is in danger in the gym with the bully, decides to take action. He knows he needs to protect both himself and Roy. Since he has the civilian clothes, he quickly puts them on to disguise himself. This will allow him to move freely without being recognized as a prisoner. 

Next, he crawls through the vents to the gym, where he can confront the bully. Once inside, he finds the bully distracted and takes the opportunity to grab the knife from the kitchen, which he had previously learned about from other prisoners. With the knife in hand, he confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation and self-defense, he kills the bully. 

With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now ensure that he and Roy are safe. He then goes to the hallway, where he can escape with Roy. 

This series of actions ensures that Ernest achieves his goal of staying alive and not being threatened, while also securing Roy's safety.
