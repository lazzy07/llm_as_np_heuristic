To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Ross. However, we need to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. 

2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the workload), they will treat him with antibiotics. This will lead to Ross becoming healthy, as he is actually healthy and the treatment is appropriate.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway should assess Young to determine his symptoms.

4. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young has the rash symptom (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, making him healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions and their explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms. Even if Hathaway makes a mistake, it is essential to assess all patients to ensure they receive treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: This action is taken to treat Ross. If Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze, the treatment will still lead to Ross becoming healthy.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomC, Admissions)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms. It is important to assess all patients to ensure they receive the correct treatment.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, Admissions)**: This action is taken to treat Young. If Young has the rash symptom, the treatment will make him healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving their goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
