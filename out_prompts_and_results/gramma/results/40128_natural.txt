To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the hero and the merchant directly, as they are both at the market.

2. **The bandit robs the hero of the sword.**  
   - The bandit can rob the hero because the hero is not armed with a sword. This action allows the bandit to take the hero's sword, which can be used for further actions or to intimidate others.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - After robbing the hero, the bandit needs to return to the crossroads to either secure the coins in the chest or prepare for further actions.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to reach the camp where the coins are stored, fulfilling the goal of having coins in the chest.

5. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest.**  
   - This final action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The bandit first needs to reach the market to interact with the hero and merchant.
- Robbing the hero is crucial as it allows the bandit to gain an additional sword, which can be used for intimidation or further actions.
- Returning to the crossroads and then to the bandit camp is necessary to secure the coins in the chest, which is the ultimate goal.
