To achieve Alex's goal, the following action is necessary:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade the item they have (the flowers, I2) with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) in the living room (R22). This action is essential because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, thus making them happy.

After this trade, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the flowers (I2) and will be happy as well, since they wanted the flowers.
- Blake will still be unhappy, but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills the requirement.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the action:
- **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to give the flowers they have to Casey in exchange for the jewelry. This is the only action needed to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
