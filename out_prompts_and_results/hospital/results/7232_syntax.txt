To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomB with Jones, the first action is to assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway should walk to PatientRoomC to assess Young. This is important to ensure that Young's condition is also evaluated, as Hathaway wants to treat all patients.

3. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should walk back to the Admissions room to assess Ross. This ensures that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Treat Young**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on their assessment. This is necessary for Young's recovery.

6. **Treat Ross**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on their assessment. This ensures that all patients are treated and healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and well-being.

### Explanation of Actions:

    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomC)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomC)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, Admissions)",
