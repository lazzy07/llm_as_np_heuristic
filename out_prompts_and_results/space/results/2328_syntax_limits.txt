Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. Since the surface is dangerous, Zoe decides to teleport back to her spaceship to ensure her safety. However, this action will make the Lizard angry, which is not conducive to their goal of friendship.
