To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21) where Casey and Blake are located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with the other characters and the items.

2. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) from the bathroom (R22). This is necessary because Casey needs to have the flowers to give them to Alex.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R21). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R21)**: This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Casey and Blake, allowing for further interactions.
- **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey needs to pick up the flowers to be able to give them to Alex. This is a crucial step in the process.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: This action directly satisfies Alex's desire for the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
