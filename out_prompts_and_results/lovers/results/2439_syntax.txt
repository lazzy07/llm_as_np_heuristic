To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Since Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy, we need to ensure that Alex receives the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). 

Here’s the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the item they want to give to Alex.
   
2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room. This is necessary for Blake to have the item to give to Alex.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves back to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary to give the item to Alex.

4. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This is necessary because it allows Alex to have an item they want, which is I1 (flowers), and it also makes Blake happy since they have helped Alex.

5. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to pick up the flowers (I1). This is necessary for Alex to obtain the item they want.

6. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room. This is necessary for Alex to achieve happiness.

Now, all characters are happy because:
- Alex has the flowers (I1) they wanted.
- Blake has given an item to Alex, which makes them happy.
- Casey is still unhappy, but since the goal is for Blake to be happy, this is acceptable.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C2, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C2, I2, R21)",
    "move(C2, R21, R22)",
    "give(C2, I2, C1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is necessary to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by helping Alex obtain the item they want.
