Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano has begun to erupt, making the environment increasingly dangerous. She sees the Lizard nearby, who is also in danger. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard peacefully, hoping to establish a friendship that could benefit them both.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand in friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to build a relationship rather than create conflict.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters are out of immediate danger.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave. This action solidifies their newfound friendship and ensures they are both safe from the eruption.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the lava and ash. This event confirms that their decision to make peace and move was the right one.

By the end of these actions, Zoe has achieved her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
