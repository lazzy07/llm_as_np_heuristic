**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, in PatientRoomC, assesses Young, who is showing no symptoms yet. Since Hathaway's workload is at 3, they mistakenly believe Young has Jarkis and treats them with steroids. Young, however, does not have Jarkis and dies as a result of the incorrect treatment.

Next, Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Jones and Ross. In the admissions room, Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also showing no symptoms. Again, due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis and treats them with steroids. Jones, like Young, does not have Jarkis and dies from the incorrect treatment.

Finally, Hathaway assesses Ross in the admissions room. Ross is also showing no symptoms, and Hathaway, still under the pressure of a high workload, mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis and treats them with steroids. Ross, too, does not have Jarkis and dies from the incorrect treatment.

In the end, Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy is not achieved, as all patients die due to misdiagnosis.
