In the current situation, Blake (C3) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is in the room with them), and Blake knows that Alex believes I3 is in the same room (R22). However, Blake also wants item I2, which is currently unknown to them. 

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, they can take the following action:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making Alex happy. Since Blake's happiness is tied to Alex's happiness, this action ensures that Blake achieves their goal.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they received the item they wanted (I3).
- Blake will also be happy because they made Alex happy.

Hereâ€™s the explanation of the action:
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action allows Blake to give the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and ensuring Blake's happiness through Alex's happiness.

The final plan in JSON format is as follows:
