To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently vulnerable since he is unarmed.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first and crucial step for the Bandit to gain coins without risking her own safety, as Tom is unarmed and cannot defend himself.
- **Walking to the Camp**: This action is essential for the Bandit to move to a safe location where she can store her ill-gotten gains.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action secures the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, completing her objective.
