To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and Casey currently has them. By giving the flowers to Alex, Casey can help Alex achieve happiness.

2. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - Blake needs to find the chocolates, which are in the dining room. This action is necessary for Blake to pursue their own happiness.

3. **Blake picks up the chocolates.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is the chocolates.

4. **Casey moves to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex and Blake, allowing for potential future interactions.

5. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake.**  
   - This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of being happy by giving Blake the jewelry, which Blake wants.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex has the flowers and is happy.
