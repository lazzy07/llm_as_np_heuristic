In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Market, where she sees Tom, the Merchant, and the Guard. The Bandit wants to carry as many coins as possible or have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since she is already at the Market and has coins in the chest at the camp, she can take the following action:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit decides to leave the Market and head back to the Bandit Camp, where she can secure the coins she has in the chest. This action helps her achieve her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

This single action is sufficient for the Bandit to achieve her goal, as it allows her to ensure that the coins are safely stored in the chest at her camp.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)"]
}
``` 

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to leave the Market, where she is currently located, and return to her camp. By doing so, she can ensure that the coins she desires are secured in her chest at the Bandit Camp, thus fulfilling her goal.
