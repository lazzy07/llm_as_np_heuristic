Roy, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife. To ensure his and Ernest's safety, Roy sneaks into the gym through the hallway, where he locks the door behind him. With the bully trapped inside, Roy confronts him. In a moment of desperation, Roy uses the knife to kill the bully, eliminating the threat once and for all.
