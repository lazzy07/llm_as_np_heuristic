Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room A, assesses Young and confirms that Young is experiencing a rash, which indicates Jarkis. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is low, they can treat Young without making a mistake. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to the Admissions room to admit Jones to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. However, since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still manageable, they can treat Jones correctly. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, assuming that the unknown symptoms could be Flaze, which is a safe assumption given the context. This treatment also successfully makes Jones healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to the Admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. Again, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, assuming the same as with Jones. This treatment makes Ross healthy as well.
