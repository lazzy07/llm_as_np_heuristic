Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A first. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can focus on determining their symptoms without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young has a fever, indicating that Young has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: After identifying the disease, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for achieving the goal of making Young healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Jones to Patient Room B, preparing to assess and treat Jones in the next step. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to, although it does not directly contribute to the immediate goal of treating Young.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with their goal.
