Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the surface to confront the Lizard and try to make peace. She believes that if she can communicate with the Lizard, they might find common ground and become friends, which is her goal. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to engage with the Lizard directly and address the situation on the surface.

Once on the surface, Zoe finds the Lizard and attempts to communicate. However, the Lizard, believing Zoe is a threat, prepares to defend its territory.

2. **Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it represents Zoe's intention to establish a friendly relationship rather than a hostile one.

The Lizard, still wary, is hesitant but ultimately decides to listen to Zoe. As they talk, the volcano begins to rumble ominously, indicating an imminent eruption.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

In the chaos of the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard work together to escape the danger. They realize that they need each other to survive, which leads to a moment of understanding.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - This action signifies the resolution of their conflict and the establishment of a friendship, fulfilling both characters' goals of wanting to be safe and make friends.

In the end, the eruption causes a significant event where the Lizard is injured but survives, while Zoe manages to escape back to the ship. They both realize that they can be allies moving forward.
