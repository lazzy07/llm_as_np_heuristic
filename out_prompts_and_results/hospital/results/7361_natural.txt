To ensure Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to assess Ross to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the high workload), this action is taken to treat Ross. If Ross actually has Flaze, he will become healthy; if not, he will die. However, the goal is to ensure Ross is treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, as Young is also a patient who needs attention. It helps to reduce Dr. Hathaway's workload.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - This action is taken to treat Young, assuming Dr. Hathaway believes Young has Jarkis. This is necessary to ensure Young's health, but it does not directly affect Ross's goal.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, as he is the last patient who needs to be assessed.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.**  
   - This action is taken to treat Jones, assuming Dr. Hathaway believes Jones has Flaze. This is necessary to ensure Jones's health, but it does not directly affect Ross's goal.

By following these actions, Ross will either become healthy or face the consequences of a mistaken treatment. However, the focus is on ensuring he receives treatment.
