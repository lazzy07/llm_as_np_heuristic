To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money. Since the bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, Bubba can go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk after satisfying his hunger.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will allow him to regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money, and the clerk is the only one with money at this point.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba decides to take the money he has stolen. This action solidifies his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his next actions.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finalizes Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
