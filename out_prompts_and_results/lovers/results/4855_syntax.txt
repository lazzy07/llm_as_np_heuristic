To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with the other characters and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Casey. This action is important because it allows Casey to receive an item, which may help in building goodwill and potentially lead to a trade or further actions.

3. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just received from Blake for the flowers (I1) that Alex has. This action is strategic as it allows Casey to engage with Alex and potentially lead to a situation where they can get the jewelry.

4. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This is the final action that directly fulfills Casey's goal of happiness by providing them with the item they want.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their necessity:

- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to interact with them.
- **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Blake gives Casey chocolates, which may help in building a positive relationship.
- **trade(C3, I2, C1, I1, R22)**: Casey trades chocolates for flowers, creating a connection with Alex.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives Casey the jewelry, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.
