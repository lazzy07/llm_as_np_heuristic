In the dining room, Alex and Blake are discussing their desires. Alex, wanting the flowers, notices the chocolates on the table. Blake, who wants the chocolates, sees that Alex is unhappy. To help Alex, Blake decides to tell Alex a lie about the chocolates being with Casey, hoping to distract Alex from the flowers. 

Blake then picks up the chocolates from the dining room and gives them to Alex, believing this will make Alex happy. However, this action does not fulfill Blake's own desire for the chocolates, leaving Blake still unhappy.
