Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing and treating the patients in the exam rooms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young, who is in Patient Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will not make a mistake yet, as their workload is still manageable.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Young has Flaze (fever), Dr. Hathaway treats them correctly, which will make Young healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room B.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Similar to Young, Ross is also experiencing Unknown. Dr. Hathaway will not make a mistake here either.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis (rash), Dr. Hathaway treats them correctly, which will make Ross healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who is in Patient Room C.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - Again, Jones is experiencing Unknown, and Dr. Hathaway will not make a mistake.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C with antibiotics.**  
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway treats them correctly, which will make Jones healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
