In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I3 (which is in the room R22), and they are currently in R22. However, they are not happy because they do not possess I3 yet. Casey (C3) has I1, which Alex does not want, and Blake (C2) wants item I2, which is currently unknown to Alex. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up item I3 from R22. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up item I3 from the room R22. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:

- Alex is now happy because they have I3.
- Blake and Casey remain unhappy, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, this action suffices.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I3, R22)"]
}
