To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, there is no risk of making a mistake.

2. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- **Assess(Jones)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomB to identify his symptoms. This is essential for determining the correct treatment and ensuring that Jones can be cured.

- **Treat(Jones)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate medication based on the symptoms identified. This action is necessary to achieve Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway can ensure that Jones is treated correctly, thus achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.
