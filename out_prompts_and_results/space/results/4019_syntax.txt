To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: This action is already completed, establishing a friendly relationship between Zoe and the Lizard. This is crucial for the Lizard to feel safe and to work towards friendship.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The Lizard, aware of the danger posed by the volcano, decides to initiate an eruption. This action is taken to create a sense of urgency and to encourage Zoe to leave the surface, ensuring both characters' safety.

3. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, ship)**: Zoe, recognizing the imminent danger from the volcano, teleports back to her spaceship. This action is necessary for her safety and aligns with her goal of being healthy and safe.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since Zoe is no longer on the surface, she is safe. The Lizard remains on the surface, but it is also safe due to the earlier peace made with Zoe, who is now in the ship.

By taking these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe, as the eruption does not affect it negatively, and it has established a friendship with Zoe.
