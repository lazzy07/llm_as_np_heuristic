**Story Completion:**

As Ernest sneaks into the gym through the vent, he sees Roy and the bully. The bully, still furious about the stolen cigarettes, is pacing back and forth, looking for a chance to assert his dominance. 

Ernest knows he must act quickly to protect both himself and Roy. He decides to confront the bully. With the knife hidden behind his back, he approaches the bully and says, "You think you can scare us? We're not afraid of you!" This bold statement catches the bully off guard.

The bully, enraged, lunges at Ernest, but Ernest is ready. In a swift motion, he pulls out the knife and stabs the bully, catching him by surprise. The bully collapses to the ground, no longer a threat to either of them.

With the bully incapacitated, Ernest turns to Roy and says, "We need to get out of here." They quickly search the gym for the pack of cigarettes but find nothing. Remembering the civilian clothes in the laundry room, they decide to make their way there.

Ernest and Roy exit the gym and head to the hallway. They crawl through the vents to reach the laundry room. Once inside, they quickly put on the civilian clothes, disguising themselves. 

Now disguised, they make their way back to the hallway and then to the highway outside the prison. With the guards none the wiser, they step onto the highway, finally free from the prison's grasp.
