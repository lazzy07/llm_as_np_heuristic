To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in Exam Room B, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Young. This is important because Young is also a patient who needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to decide on the correct treatment.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. This is necessary to evaluate another patient.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for deciding on the correct treatment for Young.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures Young's recovery.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving the goal of making all hospital patients healthy.
