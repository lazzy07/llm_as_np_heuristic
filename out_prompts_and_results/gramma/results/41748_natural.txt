**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market. (The bandit wants to be at the market to find opportunities to acquire coins.)
2. The bandit approaches the guard and reports the location of the bandit. (The bandit wants to create a distraction to allow for easier access to the coins in the chest.)
3. The guard, believing the bandit is at the crossroads, leaves the market to investigate. (This action creates an opportunity for the bandit to act without the guard's interference.)
4. The bandit walks back to the crossroads. (The bandit returns to the crossroads to access the chest without the guard present.)
5. The bandit loots the coins from the chest. (This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit first moves to the market to create a diversion and to be closer to the guard, which is a strategic move to manipulate the situation.
- Reporting the bandit to the guard is a clever tactic to draw the guard away from the crossroads, where the chest is located.
- Once the guard is distracted, the bandit can safely return to the crossroads and access the chest without fear of being caught.
- Finally, looting the coins from the chest fulfills the bandit's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.
