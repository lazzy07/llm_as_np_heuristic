To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano, which is a key event in the story.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard to engage with it, which is essential for building a relationship.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.
4. **erupt(Surface)**: This action completes the eruption of the volcano, leading to the death of one character.

Now, let's break down the reasoning behind each action:

- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This starts the volcanic eruption, which is crucial for the story's climax.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Lizard)**: By walking towards the Lizard, Zoe shows her intention to communicate and build a relationship, which is a step towards friendship.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends and also helps the Lizard achieve its goal of safety and friendship.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This final action results in the eruption of the volcano, which will lead to the death of one character, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.

The final sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of the story, where the volcano erupts, resulting in a character's death, while also allowing for the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
