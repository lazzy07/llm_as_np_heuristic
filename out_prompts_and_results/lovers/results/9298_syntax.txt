To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the chocolates (I3) they picked up with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake (C2) will move to the dining room (R21) to pick up the flowers (I2) that they want. This action is not directly related to Alex's happiness but is necessary for Blake to achieve their own happiness.

3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Casey (C3) will give the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is necessary to finalize the transfer of the item that Alex wants.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, which will make them happy. 

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex trades chocolates for jewelry with Casey. This is crucial for Alex to get what they want.
2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pursue their own happiness. This action is not directly related to Alex's goal but is part of the overall story.
3. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex, ensuring Alex is happy.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
