In this story, we will focus on Ross and ensure he achieves his goal of being alive and healthy. The actions will be carefully chosen to avoid mistakes and ensure Ross receives the correct treatment.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. If he has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to Exam Room C**: Young, who is currently in the admissions room, will walk to Exam Room C. This action is not directly related to Ross's treatment but ensures that Young is also attended to, maintaining the overall health of the patients in the hospital.
