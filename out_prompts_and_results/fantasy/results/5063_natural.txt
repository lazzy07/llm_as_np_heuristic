To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes either happy or wealthy, or both. Given the current situation, Talia is at the village, and the treasure is at the cave. The treasure is likely to make Talia wealthy, which aligns with her goal. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary because Rory needs to be at the village to help Talia. Since Rory is currently at the cave, he must travel to the village to facilitate the next actions.

2. **Rory gives the treasure to Talia.**  
   - This action is crucial because Talia needs to acquire the treasure to become wealthy. Rory, upon arriving at the village, can give the treasure to Talia, which he can do since he is now at the same location.

3. **Talia becomes wealthy.**  
   - By receiving the treasure from Rory, Talia's wealth increases, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy.

4. **Talia proposes to Rory.**
