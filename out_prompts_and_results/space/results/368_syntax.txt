To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** 
   - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the Surface where the volcano is located for it to erupt and for the story to progress towards the desired ending.

2. **The volcano erupts.**
   - This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt, which will lead to a character's death.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.**
   - This is the outcome of the eruption, fulfilling the condition of a character dying.

4. **The Lizard, witnessing the eruption and Zoe's demise, feels a sense of loss and realizes the importance of friendship.**
   - This is a narrative conclusion that leads to the Lizard wanting to make friends with Zoe, even though she is no longer alive. The Lizard's feelings of loss can symbolize the potential for friendship that was never fully realized.

5. **The Lizard decides to honor Zoe's memory by becoming friends with her spirit.**
   - This action represents the Lizard's acceptance of Zoe and the desire to connect with her, thus achieving the goal of making friends.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.
2. The volcano erupts.
3. Zoe is killed by the eruption.
4. The Lizard decides to honor Zoe's memory and becomes friends with her spirit.

This sequence ensures that the volcano erupts, a character dies, and the Lizard makes a connection with Zoe, fulfilling the story's requirements.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Zoe, Zoe, Surface)",
    "make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan captures the necessary actions to achieve the desired ending while adhering to the constraints of the story.
