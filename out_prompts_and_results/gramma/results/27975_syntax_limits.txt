In this story, the Bandit is currently at the Crossroads and has the Medicine that Tom was carrying. The Banditâ€™s goal is to have as many coins as possible in the chest at the Bandit Camp. To achieve this, the Bandit will take the following action:

1. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.
