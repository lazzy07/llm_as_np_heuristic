To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation shows that Casey is happy with the jewelry (I3), and Alex is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I1). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to the bathroom where the chocolates are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to help Blake.

2. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to follow Casey. This is important because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate effectively.

3. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to inform Casey about Blake's desire for the chocolates, which will help in the next steps.

4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Blake. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and help them achieve happiness.

5. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex. This is a trade-off that allows Casey to help Alex, who is unhappy.

6. **give(C2, I1, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I1) to Casey. This is the final step where Alex gives the item they have to Casey, ensuring that Blake can now be happy.

7. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Finally, Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action ensures that Blake receives the item they want, achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates, and the story will conclude successfully.
