In this story, we want to ensure that Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know if Ross has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat(Ross)**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate medication. If Ross has Flaze, he receives antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he receives steroids. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy.

By following these two actions, Ross will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy.
