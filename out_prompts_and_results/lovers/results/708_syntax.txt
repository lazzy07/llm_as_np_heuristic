To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake wants item I2, which is currently unknown to them. 

Here's the shortest story to achieve Blake's goal:

1. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Casey tells Blake that they want item I2, which is in the bathroom. This is a necessary action because it informs Blake about the item they need to pursue to be happy.

2. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to check for item I2. This action is necessary for Casey to verify the location of the item they just mentioned.

3. **believes(C3, at(I2)) = R12**: Casey now believes that item I2 is in the bathroom.

4. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bathroom to follow up on the information Casey provided.

5. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up item I2 from the bathroom. This is crucial as it directly leads to Blake's happiness.

6. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down item I2 in the living room, making it accessible for Casey.

7. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room to retrieve item I2.

8. **pick_up(C3, I2, R22)**: Casey picks up item I2 from the living room. This action allows Casey to achieve their happiness.

9. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives item I2 to Blake. This final action ensures that Blake has the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.
