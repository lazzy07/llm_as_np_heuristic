**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, this treatment is a gamble. However, it is the only option available to Hathaway at this moment.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload reduces to 1. Jones becomes healthy from the treatment, as he was indeed suffering from Flaze.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to assess Ross and Young. Since both are still in Admissions, Hathaway can assess them one by one. 

Dr. Hathaway first assesses Ross, who is also experiencing Unknown. Again, Hathaway cannot identify the disease, but he decides to treat Ross with steroids, suspecting he might have Jarkis. This is another gamble, but Hathaway is determined to help all patients.

After treating Ross, he becomes healthy as he was indeed suffering from Jarkis. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is also experiencing Unknown. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, suspecting Flaze. Young becomes healthy as well.

Now, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
