To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals. Since they are currently not fighting, this action can succeed.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is necessary to explore the cave and potentially find a safe place away from the dangers of the surface.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures they are both in a safe location together.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe will again solidify their friendship with the Lizard. This action is important to ensure that their relationship remains strong and that they can work together for mutual safety.

5. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe will walk back to the surface to check on the volcano. This action is necessary to assess the situation and ensure that they are not in immediate danger.

6. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano will begin to erupt. This action is included to create a sense of urgency and danger, prompting Zoe and the Lizard to act quickly.

7. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will quickly return to the cave to escape the eruption. This action is essential for their safety.

8. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also return to the cave, ensuring both characters are safe from the eruption.

9. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are in the cave, they remain safe.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
