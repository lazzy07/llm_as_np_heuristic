To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit will not need to attack or kill anyone else since she has already successfully robbed Tom and can now secure her coins.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without risking her own life or being attacked, as Tom is already dead and cannot defend himself.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, which is one of her primary objectives.
