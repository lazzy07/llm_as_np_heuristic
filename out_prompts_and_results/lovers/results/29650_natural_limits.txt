In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to tell Casey that Blake wants the flowers. 

**Action:**
- Alex tells Casey that Blake wants the flowers.

**Explanation:**
This action is strategic because it creates a sense of urgency for Casey to consider giving the flowers to Blake, which may lead to a trade or a transfer of the flowers to Alex. Since Alex believes that Casey wants to make Blake happy, Casey may be inclined to give the flowers to Blake, allowing Alex to then ask Blake for the flowers in exchange for the jewelry.

However, since the goal is to keep the story short and ensure Alex achieves their goal, we can conclude that this single action is sufficient to set the stage for Alex to eventually get the flowers, as it influences Casey's decision-making.

**Final Plan:**
