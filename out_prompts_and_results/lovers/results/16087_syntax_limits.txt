To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I3 (the item in the room). Since I3 is already in the same room as Alex (R22), the simplest action for Alex to take is to pick up I3.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **pick_up(C1, I3, R22)**: Alex picks up the item they want (I3) from the room they are in (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they desire.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have I3.
- Casey and Blake remain unhappy, but their happiness is not the goal of this story.

The action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire, which is the primary objective of the story.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I3, R22)"]
}
