To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Bandit, Bandit Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will walk to the Crossroads, which is a strategic move to potentially ambush the Merchant or interact with Tom.

3. **report(Merchant, location(Bandit), Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit's location to the Guard, ensuring that the Bandit is targeted and potentially removed from the scene, which helps the Merchant feel safer and allows her to conduct business without fear of robbery.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report.

5. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, as the Bandit is a criminal and the Guard's goal is to eliminate criminals.

6. **loot(Merchant, BanditSword, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit's sword, which is a valuable item that can be sold for coins.

7. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, MerchantCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the coin from Tom, using the coins she has earned from her sales, thus increasing her total coin count.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins while avoiding criminal activity. The Merchant's actions are strategic, as she reports the Bandit to the Guard, which not only helps her but also aligns with her goal of staying within legal boundaries.
