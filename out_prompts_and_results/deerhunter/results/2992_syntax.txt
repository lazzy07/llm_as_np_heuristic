To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure the money from the bank clerk.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest where he is and head to the bank to confront the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where the money is.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the bank after committing the theft.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already confirmed dead from the previous events.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to transition from the forest, where he has just eaten Bambi, to the bank where the money is located.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling his greed and achieving the goal of having money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to leave the bank after successfully stealing the money, ensuring he is not caught.
