In the village, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are all present. Gargax, being a hungry dragon, is motivated to eat a human to satisfy his hunger. Since Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, she is not in immediate danger. However, Gargax's hunger drives him to take action.

1. Gargax eats Vince. This action is necessary because Gargax wants to satisfy his hunger, and Vince is the only human available in the village. After eating Vince, Gargax will be less hungry, and Vince will be dead, allowing Gargax to take the money from Vince's body.

2. Gargax takes the money from Vince's body. This action is important because it allows Gargax to become wealthy, which is one of his goals. However, this action also indirectly benefits Talia, as she is married to Vince and will inherit the wealth through her marriage.

After these actions, Talia's happiness will not be directly affected, but she will become wealthy through her marriage to Vince, which fulfills her goal of wanting to be wealthy.
