**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Young is showing symptoms of Fever, decides to treat Young for Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the urgency of treating Young outweighs this risk. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** 
   - This action is necessary because Young is experiencing Fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. Treating Young correctly will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 2. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is still in Admissions and has not been assigned to an exam room yet. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

Now, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. 

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms so that he can be treated appropriately.

Assuming Ross shows symptoms of Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot treat him correctly without knowing the specific symptoms. However, since Dr. Hathaway's workload is still manageable, he can now focus on Jones.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Jones is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

Now, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**
   - This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms so that he can be treated appropriately.

Assuming Jones also shows symptoms of Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot treat him correctly without knowing the specific symptoms. However, since Young has already been treated and is now healthy, Dr. Hathaway has achieved his goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients to ensure their health. The sequence of admitting and assessing patients is crucial to identify their conditions and provide the necessary treatments. The focus on Young first was to ensure that at least one patient is treated correctly, which fulfills Dr. Hathaway's goal of having healthy patients.
