Zoe, realizing the danger of the volcano on the surface, decides to teleport back down to the planet to warn the Lizard. She teleports from the spaceship to the surface, where she finds the Lizard. 

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports to the surface to confront the Lizard and warn him about the impending eruption. This action is necessary for her to communicate directly with the Lizard.

Once on the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard and attempts to make peace, hoping to establish a friendship and work together to escape the danger of the volcano.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and friendship. This action also prevents any fighting, allowing them to collaborate.

As they are making peace, the volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. They must act quickly to escape.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a critical event that leads to the death of one character. In this case, the eruption signifies the end of the story, as it fulfills the condition of a character dying.

In this story, Zoe successfully warns the Lizard and they become friends, but the eruption ultimately leads to the Lizard's demise, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
