Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, decides to assess Ross, who is in Patient Room A. Since Ross is in the adjacent room, Hathaway can easily walk there. After assessing Ross, Hathaway discovers that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway then treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Ross healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is currently in Admissions, and Hathaway needs to ensure he is treated as well. After admitting Young to Patient Room C, Hathaway assesses him and finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Young healthy.

With both Ross and Young treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
