**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but she proceeds anyway. After assessing Jones, she mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the high workload. She treats Jones with steroids, which is incorrect for his condition, and unfortunately, Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. She assesses Young and correctly identifies that he has Flaze, as he is experiencing a fever. She treats Young with antibiotics, and he becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. She assesses Ross and finds that he has Flaze as well. She treats Ross with antibiotics, and he also becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young and Ross, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy, despite the unfortunate outcome for Jones.
