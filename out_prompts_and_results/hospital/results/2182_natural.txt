**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, seeing that Ross is still in the admissions room, decides to admit Young to Patient Room B to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to keep the flow of patients moving.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to the increased workload. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Ross dies.

Afterward, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Young is also experiencing unknown symptoms, but since Hathaway's workload is now back to 2 after treating Ross, he correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Flaze and treats him with antibiotics. Young becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to check on Jones. He assesses Jones in Patient Room C, where Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 2, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis and treats him with steroids, leading to Jones's unfortunate demise.

In the end, only Young remains healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has done his best to treat the patients, albeit with some mistakes due to the workload.
