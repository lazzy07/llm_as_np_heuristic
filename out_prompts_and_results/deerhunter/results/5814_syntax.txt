To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Given the current situation, he has already shot Bambi, which means he can now eat her to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will also need to go back to the bank to steal from the clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and focus on his next goal, which is to get money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank. This action is essential as it takes him to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals from the clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial because it allows him to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and focus on his next goal.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the bank where he can confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Achieves Bubba's goal of acquiring money by stealing from the clerk.
