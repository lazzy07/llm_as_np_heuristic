To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will leave the Market and head towards the Crossroads. This action is necessary to move away from the scene of the attacks and to a location where they can access the bandit camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to reach their preferred location where they can store the coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in their possession.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions are necessary for the Bandit to escape the Market, where they have just attacked and killed the Merchant and the Guard, and to reach the Bandit Camp, which is their preferred location.
- The last action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to achieve their goal of having coins, either by carrying them or storing them in the chest.
