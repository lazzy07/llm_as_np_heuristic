To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to increase her coin count directly.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will then take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then retrieves the coins from her camp, achieving her goal of maximizing her coin count.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain a coin without any risk of being attacked since Tom is already dead.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, which is one of her primary goals.
