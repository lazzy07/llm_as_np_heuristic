Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is alive and in the room, Hathaway can accurately assess him. After the assessment, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the care he needs, as he is still in Admissions and has not been assessed yet.
