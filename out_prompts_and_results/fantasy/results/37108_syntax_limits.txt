To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Since Talia has two marriage proposals (from Rory and Vince), she can accept one of them, which will make her happy. Additionally, she already possesses treasure, which contributes to her wealth.

Here’s the shortest story that meets the criteria:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action makes Talia happy because she is now in a relationship with Rory, fulfilling her desire for happiness.

This single action is sufficient to ensure Talia's happiness, as she has already acquired treasure, which contributes to her wealth. 

The final state after this action would be:
- Talia is happy due to her acceptance of Rory's proposal.
- Talia remains wealthy because she possesses the treasure.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively achieves the goal of making Talia happy while keeping the story concise and focused on the necessary actions.
