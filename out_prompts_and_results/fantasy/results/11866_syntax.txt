To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Since both Rory and Vince have proposed to Talia, she can choose to accept one of their proposals, which will make her happy. Additionally, she can also acquire the treasure in the cave, which will make her wealthy.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes Talia happy because she is now in a relationship with Rory.
2. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action increases her wealth.

Now, Talia is both happy and wealthy, fulfilling her goals.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her primary goals.
- **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of becoming wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can increase her wealth.
