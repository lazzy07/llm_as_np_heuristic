**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Young, who is currently unassigned to any exam room. This action is necessary to determine if Young has any symptoms that need to be treated. 

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway admits them to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Young is in a designated area for treatment.

3. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway treats Young based on the symptoms assessed. If Young shows symptoms of either Flaze or Jarkis, Hathaway will administer the appropriate treatment, ensuring that Young becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assess Young**: This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify any symptoms Young may have, which is necessary for determining the correct treatment.
  
- **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: This action is necessary to officially assign Young to a treatment area, which is required before any treatment can be administered.

- **Treat Young**: This action is the final step to ensure that Young receives the appropriate treatment based on their symptoms, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.
