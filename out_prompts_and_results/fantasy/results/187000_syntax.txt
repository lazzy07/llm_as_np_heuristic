2. **take(Rory, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Rory takes the money from Vince, who is in the cave. This action increases Rory's wealth, and since Talia is now married to Rory, it indirectly contributes to Talia's wealth as well.

4. **travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia travels to the cave to join Rory and Vince.
5. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince travels back to the village, leaving the cave.
