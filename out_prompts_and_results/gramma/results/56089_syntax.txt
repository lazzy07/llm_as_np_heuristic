To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom is currently at the Market. He needs to move to the Crossroads to access the path to the cottage.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom will walk to the Cottage, where he wants to be.

3. **take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: Since the medicine is with the Merchant at the Crossroads, Tom will take the medicine from the Merchant before leaving the Crossroads.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to leave the Market and head towards the Crossroads, which is a junction leading to the Cottage.
  
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: After reaching the Crossroads, Tom needs to continue to the Cottage to fulfill his goal of being there.

- **take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Crossroads)**: This action is crucial because Tom needs to acquire the medicine from the Merchant before he can leave the Crossroads for the Cottage.

With these actions, Tom successfully reaches the Cottage while carrying the medicine.
