To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, assesses and treats all patients correctly to achieve the goal of having all patients healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: This action is necessary to assign Young to an exam room so that Hathaway can assess and treat them. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, which is critical for the next steps.

2. **Walk Hathaway from Admissions to Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to assess Ross, who is already assigned to Exam Room A. This action is necessary to check Ross's symptoms.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics in Exam Room A**: Assuming Ross has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will make Ross healthy.

5. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room A to Exam Room B**: Hathaway needs to assess Jones next, who is assigned to Exam Room B.

6. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms.

7. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics in Exam Room B**: Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will make Jones healthy.

8. **Walk Hathaway from Exam Room B to Exam Room C**: Hathaway needs to assess Young, who is now assigned to Exam Room C.

9. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms.

10. **Treat Young with Antibiotics in Exam Room C**: Assuming Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. This will make Young healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
