To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake wants item I2, which is currently unknown to us. However, we know that Casey wants I2 and is currently unhappy. 

To complete the story, we can have Blake take the following actions:

1. **Tell Blake that Casey wants I2**: This will help Blake understand that Casey has the item they desire.
2. **Move to the living room**: This is necessary to access the bathroom where I2 is located.
3. **Pick up I2 from the bathroom**: This is the item Blake wants to be happy.
4. **Move back to the dining room**: This is to be in a location where they can interact with Casey.
5. **Give I2 to Casey**: This will make Casey happy, and since Blake is helping Casey, it will also make Blake happy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **tell(C3, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Casey that they want I2, which is crucial for understanding the situation.
2. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the bathroom to find I2.
3. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up I2, which is the item they want.
4. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake returns to the dining room to interact with Casey.
5. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Blake gives I2 to Casey, making both characters happy.
