To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The bandit starts at the cottage and walks to the crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom and the merchant.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom, who is not armed. This allows the bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying.

3. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit walks to the bandit camp to secure the coins in the chest.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit takes the coins from Tom and places them in the chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:

- The bandit then walks to the camp to secure the stolen coins.
- The take action is performed to ensure the coins are safely stored in the chest at the bandit camp.
