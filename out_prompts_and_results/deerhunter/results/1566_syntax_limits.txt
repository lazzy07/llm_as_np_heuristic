After shooting Bambi, Bubba realizes he is still hungry and has no money. He decides to go back to the bank to steal money from the clerk, who is still there and unaware of Bubba's actions in the forest.

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba threatens the clerk and steals the money.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where he can fulfill his greed, and the second action directly results in him acquiring the money he desires.
