**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes that he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the laundry room, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy escapes from the prison.** 
   - This action is crucial as it allows Roy to leave the prison and avoid the bully's threats. Since he is disguised, he can blend in and avoid detection.

2. **Day one ends.** 
   - The day ends, and Roy is now outside the prison, safe from the bully.

3. **Day two begins.** 
   - The story continues with Roy outside the prison, having successfully escaped.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Roy's escape is the only action necessary for him to achieve his goal of being alive and free. By escaping, he avoids the threats posed by the bully and ensures his survival. The other actions, such as doing chores or interacting with the bully, are not necessary for Roy's immediate goal since he has already secured the cigarettes and is in disguise.
