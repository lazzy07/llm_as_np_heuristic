To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and establish a friendship with the Lizard while avoiding the dangers of the erupting volcano. Here’s the sequence of actions that will help her achieve her goals:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to get to a safer location away from the erupting volcano and to engage with the Lizard.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: In the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the surface. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters are aware of the erupting volcano and can take action together.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is included to show the imminent danger that both characters need to address.

5. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks back to the cave to escape the eruption. This action is necessary for both characters to find safety.

6. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard again in the cave, reinforcing their friendship and ensuring they are both safe together.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
