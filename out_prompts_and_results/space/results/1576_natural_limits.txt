Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She knows that the Lizard, as the guardian of the surface, is also in peril. Instead of fighting, Zoe decides to approach the Lizard with a peaceful intention. 

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe extends a hand of friendship to the Lizard, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to establish a friendly relationship.

2. **Walk to the Cave**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they both move to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting surface. This action ensures that both characters can avoid the danger of the volcano and continue to build their friendship.

By making peace and moving to safety together, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also fostering a friendship with the Lizard.
