**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to Exam Room A, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones is alive and healthy, Hathaway believes he is healthy, but he needs to check for symptoms to confirm. 

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing, Hathaway determines that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

At this point, Jones has achieved his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (assessing Jones) is necessary to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for determining the correct treatment.
- The second action (treating Jones with antibiotics) is essential because it directly addresses the identified disease (Flaze) and ensures Jones's health.
