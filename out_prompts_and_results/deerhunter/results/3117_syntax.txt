To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money while also considering the other characters' states and actions. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is hungry and has already decided to get money. He goes back to the bank to confront the clerk and potentially steal more money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, now at the bank with a loaded rifle, decides to shoot the clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the threat and take the money without resistance.

3. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk's body. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and is a grim but necessary step in his survival.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: Finally, Bubba picks up the money from the bank after having dealt with the clerk. This action fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Shooting the clerk is essential for Bubba to eliminate any opposition and secure the money.
- **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: Eating the clerk addresses Bubba's hunger, which is a priority for him.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This final action allows Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.
