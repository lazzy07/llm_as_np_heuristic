The bandit, wanting to carry as many coins as possible, decides to take advantage of the situation. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The bandit needs to move to a location where she can interact with the merchant and the guard, as they are both at the crossroads.

2. **The bandit attacks the merchant.**  
   - The bandit is armed and the merchant is not armed, making this a viable action. By attacking the merchant, the bandit can take the medicine and any coins the merchant might have.

3. **The bandit loots the merchant's corpse.**  
   - After successfully attacking the merchant, the bandit can loot the merchant's body to take the medicine and any coins the merchant had.

At this point, the bandit has achieved her goal of carrying as many coins as possible (if the merchant had any) and has also acquired the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to the crossroads**: This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the merchant and the guard, as they are both present there.
- **Attacking the merchant**: This action allows the bandit to eliminate a non-armed character and take valuable items from her.
- **Looting the merchant's corpse**: This final action ensures that the bandit collects the items she needs to fulfill her goal.
