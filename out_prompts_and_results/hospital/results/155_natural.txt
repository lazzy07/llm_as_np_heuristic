**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2 but allows for the assessment of another patient.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Upon entering, Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers he is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Ross healthy.

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1. Hathaway then walks back to Patient Room A to assess Jones. Upon assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, making Jones healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Young. Upon assessing Young, Hathaway finds that he is also experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, making Young healthy as well.
