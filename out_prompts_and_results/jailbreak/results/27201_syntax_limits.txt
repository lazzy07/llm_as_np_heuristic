**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Roy finds himself in the gym with the bully. Knowing that the bully is a threat, he decides to take action. He has the knife hidden in his clothes, and he knows he must act quickly to ensure his survival and that of his friend Ernest.

Roy locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action is crucial because it isolates the bully, giving Roy the upper hand. With the door secured, Roy confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation and determination, he uses the knife to kill the bully. This action not only eliminates the immediate threat but also allows Roy to feel a sense of control over his situation.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely move to the hallway. He puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. This disguise is essential for his escape plan. Once disguised, he makes his way to the highway, where he successfully escapes from the prison.
