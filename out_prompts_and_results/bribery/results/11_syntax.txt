In this story, the Hero's goal is to ensure that the Villain does not control the President. The Villain has already threatened the Hero and coerced them into wanting the money, which the Hero has stolen. The Hero now has the money and can use it strategically to achieve their goal.

1. **bribe(Villain, President, Money)**: The Hero uses the money they have stolen to bribe the Villain into wanting the President to have the money. This action is crucial because it shifts the Villain's focus away from controlling the President to wanting to give the money to the President, thus neutralizing the Villain's threat.

2. **give(Villain, President, Money)**: The Villain, now coerced by the bribe, gives the money to the President. This action ensures that the President now has the money, which further distances the Villain from any control over the President.

At this point, the Villain is no longer in a position to control the President, as their focus has shifted to the money and the President now possesses it. The Hero has successfully achieved their goal of preventing the Villain from controlling the President.
