To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure that Rory has picked up. Since Gargax is currently in the Village and Rory is in the Cave with the treasure, Gargax will need to take specific actions to reach Rory and acquire the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels to the Cave where Rory is located. This is necessary for Gargax to confront Rory and obtain the treasure.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action allows Gargax to eliminate Rory, who is the only character standing between Gargax and the treasure. After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure without any opposition.

3. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's dead body. This action allows Gargax to finally obtain the treasure, fulfilling their goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, Gargax is wealthy (having the treasure) and not hungry (having just eaten Rory). 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel**: This action is essential for Gargax to reach the location where the treasure is held.
- **eat**: This action is necessary for Gargax to remove Rory from the equation, allowing Gargax to take the treasure without any resistance.
- **take**: This action allows Gargax to claim the treasure, achieving their goal of wealth.
