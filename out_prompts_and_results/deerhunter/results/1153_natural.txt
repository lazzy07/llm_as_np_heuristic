To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he has a loaded rifle. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba is greedy and wants money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal the money.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money. He is hungry and has no money, so stealing is the quickest way to achieve his goal.
  
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money without any resistance from the clerk.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
