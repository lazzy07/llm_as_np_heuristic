To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage carrying the medicine. This action directly fulfills his goal of reaching the Cottage.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine with him from the market, and there are no obstacles preventing him from walking to the cottage.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to move from the Crossroads to the Cottage, where he wants to be. Since he already possesses the medicine, this action completes his objective.
