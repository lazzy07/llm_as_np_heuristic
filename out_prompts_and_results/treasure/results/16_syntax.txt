After the events that have already occurred, Hawkins has successfully dug up the treasure and taken it for himself. Since Silver believes that the treasure is buried on the island, he is unaware that Hawkins has already claimed it. 

To ensure that Hawkins achieves his goal of keeping the treasure, he can take the following actions:

1. **sail()**: Hawkins can sail back to the port with the treasure. This action is necessary for him to leave the island and take the treasure to safety.
2. **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: This action has already been completed, confirming that Hawkins has the treasure.

Since Hawkins has already taken the treasure, he can now simply sail back to the port to secure it.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **sail()**: This action is crucial for Hawkins to leave the island with the treasure. It allows him to transport the treasure to a safe location (the port) where he can keep it away from Silver.
- **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: This action has already been completed, confirming that Hawkins has successfully claimed the treasure.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["sail()"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hawkins achieves his goal of keeping the treasure by safely returning to the port.
