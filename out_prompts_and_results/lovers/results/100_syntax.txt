To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R21) to the bathroom (R12). This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and potentially trade items.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic lie because Alex actually wants the flowers (I1). By misleading Casey, Alex hopes to create an opportunity for a trade.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R12) to the living room (R22). This is necessary for Casey to be in a position to potentially give or trade items.

4. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex follows Casey into the living room (R22). Now both characters are in the same room, allowing for interaction.

5. **trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) they picked up earlier for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action directly fulfills Alex's goal of obtaining the flowers.

6. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R21) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for happiness but helps to conclude the story with Alex in a different location.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers (I1) and will be happy, achieving their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Allows Alex to be in the same room as Casey to communicate.
- **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: A strategic lie to manipulate Casey into thinking Alex wants the chocolates, setting up for a trade.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to a new room, creating distance and allowing for a potential trade.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex follows Casey to facilitate the trade.
- **trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R22)**: The crucial action where Alex gets what they truly want (flowers).
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Concludes the story with Alex in a different location.
