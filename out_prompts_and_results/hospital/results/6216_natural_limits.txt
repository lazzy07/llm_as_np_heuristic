Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3, but this is manageable for the next action.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Jones, who has just been admitted to Patient Room B.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** (This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway will assume he has Flaze, as it is the only disease that can be treated with antibiotics.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with antibiotics.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Jones becomes healthy. Since Jones is assumed to have Flaze, the treatment is appropriate, and he will recover.)

After these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
