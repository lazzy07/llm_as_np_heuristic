To ensure Young achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Admit Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will admit Young to a different exam room (B) to manage the workload better and prepare for the assessment of the other patients.
2. **Walk(Young, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomB)**: Young will walk to PatientRoomB, where they will be assessed for their symptoms.
3. **Assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to confirm the symptoms. Since Young has SymptomB, Hathaway will correctly identify that Young has Jarkis.
4. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway will treat Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring Young becomes healthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Admit Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomB**: This action is necessary to manage the workload and allow Hathaway to focus on Young's treatment without confusion from other patients.
- **Walk(Young, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomB)**: Young needs to be in the room where they will be assessed and treated, so this action is essential for their progression towards health.
- **Assess(Hathaway, Young, SymptomB, PatientRoomB)**: This assessment is crucial to determine the correct diagnosis and treatment for Young, ensuring that they receive the appropriate care.
- **Treat(Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomB)**: This final action is vital as it directly leads to Young's recovery, fulfilling their goal of being alive and healthy.
