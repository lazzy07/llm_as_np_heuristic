To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to get the money from the bank clerk. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi will remain dead from the earlier action. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, allowing him to interact with the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk at gunpoint, fulfilling the requirement for Bubba to have money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is already dead, thus achieving the story's goal.
