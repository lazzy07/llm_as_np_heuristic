Zoe looks around at the erupting surface and realizes that both she and the Lizard are in danger. Since they are friends now, she decides to take action to ensure their safety. Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship, where she can be safe from the eruption. 

This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe and healthy. By teleporting to the spaceship, she avoids the danger posed by the erupting surface and can later return to help the Lizard if needed.
