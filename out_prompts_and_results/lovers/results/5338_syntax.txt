To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to give Casey the item they want (chocolates) while receiving the item that Alex wants (flowers).

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: After the trade, Blake will give the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
