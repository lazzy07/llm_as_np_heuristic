To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will ultimately result in one character dying. The goal is to have Zoe and the Lizard make peace before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard are currently in the same location (the cave) and are not fighting. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, and the Lizard also desires friendship. This action allows them to establish a positive relationship, which is essential for both characters' goals.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. Since the surface is already deemed dangerous, this action leads to the demise of one character.

3. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption causes the Lizard to be killed, as it is on the surface when the volcano erupts. This action signifies the end of the Lizard's life due to the volcanic eruption.

The story unfolds as follows:

- Zoe and the Lizard, both in the cave, realize they share a common goal of wanting to be healthy, safe, and make friends. They decide to make peace, establishing a friendship.
- However, the volcano erupts, and since the Lizard is on the surface, it cannot escape the eruption, leading to its demise.

This sequence of actions fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt, resulting in a character's death, while also allowing for the characters to make peace before the tragic event.
