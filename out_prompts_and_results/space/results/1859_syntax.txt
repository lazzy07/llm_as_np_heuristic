To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action starts the eruption of the volcano on the surface of the planet. It is necessary to create a dangerous situation that will lead to a character's demise.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface. This action is necessary for Zoe to be on the surface when the volcano erupts.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt. Since Zoe is now on the surface, she will be caught in the eruption.

4. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)**: After the eruption, the Lizard, who is still in the cave, can make peace with Zoe. This action is necessary to ensure that despite the tragic event, they establish a friendship.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation on the surface.
- Zoe, wanting to explore and perhaps help the Lizard, walks from the cave to the surface.
- The volcano erupts while Zoe is on the surface, resulting in her demise.
- The Lizard, realizing the importance of friendship and safety, makes peace with Zoe, acknowledging her bravery and desire for connection.

This sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome of a character dying (Zoe) and the Lizard making peace with her, thus establishing a friendship.

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "begin_erupt(Surface)",
    "walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is carefully chosen to ensure that the story meets the specified ending while adhering to the constraints of the characters and locations.
