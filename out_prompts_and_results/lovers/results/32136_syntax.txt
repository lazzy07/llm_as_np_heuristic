To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want. In this case, Blake wants the chocolates (I2). Since the current situation indicates that I2 is not in any character's possession, we need to find a way to get it to Blake.

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Tell (C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Blake (C2) tells Alex (C1) that Casey (C3) has the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, but it will prompt Alex to take action to help Blake.
   
2. **Move (C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) to check on Casey and the chocolates.

3. **Move (C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) to follow Alex, as they want to be near their friend.

4. **Pick Up (C2, I2, R22)**: Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R22), as they are now in the same room.

5. **Give (C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22).

6. **Give (C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) back to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22).

Now, Blake has the chocolates (I2) and is happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Tell**: This action is necessary to create a situation where Alex believes they need to find the chocolates, prompting them to move.
- **Move**: Alex and Casey move to the dining room to check for the chocolates, which is essential for Blake to eventually get them.
- **Pick Up**: Blake picks up the chocolates, which is the item they want to achieve happiness.
- **Give**: The first give action allows Alex to pass the chocolates to Blake, and the second give action is to ensure that Blake has the item they want.
