**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient in the room, Hathaway can focus on him without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room B. After admitting Ross, Hathaway assesses him in Patient Room B and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room C. After admitting Young, Hathaway assesses him in Patient Room C and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, and Young becomes healthy as well.

At this point, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.
