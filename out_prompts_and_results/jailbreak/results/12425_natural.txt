**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take a risk. He knows that the knife is in the kitchen, and he needs it to defend himself and Roy. He sneaks into the kitchen through the hallway, hoping to grab the knife without being seen.

1. **Action: Ernest moves to the kitchen.**  
   - This action is necessary for Ernest to obtain the knife, which he needs to protect himself and Roy from the bully.

Once in the kitchen, Ernest quickly grabs the knife. However, he knows that the bully is still a threat, so he decides to lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming after them.

2. **Action: Ernest locks the gym door.**  
   - Locking the gym door is a strategic move to keep the bully contained and unable to threaten them immediately.

With the gym door locked, Ernest feels a bit safer. He then decides to put on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself to prepare for a potential escape.

3. **Action: Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.**  
   - This action is crucial for Ernest to disguise himself, allowing him to escape from the prison later.

Now disguised, Ernest heads back to the hallway, ready to make his move.

4. **Action: Ernest moves to the hallway.**  
   - Moving to the hallway is necessary for Ernest to access the highway and escape.

Once in the hallway, Ernest crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison.

5. **Action: Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.**  
   - Crawling through the vents is the only way for Ernest to escape the prison without being caught by the guards or the bully.

Finally, once on the highway, Ernest feels a sense of freedom. He has successfully escaped the prison, overcoming the bully's threats.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at either obtaining the knife for protection, locking the bully out, disguising himself for escape, or ultimately escaping the prison. The actions are sequential and build upon each other to ensure that Ernest can escape without being threatened by the bully.
