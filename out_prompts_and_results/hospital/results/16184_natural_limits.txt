Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room B, decides to assess Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient assigned to that room, Hathaway's workload remains manageable at 2. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and discovers that Young is experiencing a fever, which indicates that Young has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify the correct disease and ensure proper treatment.

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: After identifying the symptoms, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Jones, who is still in Admissions, to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated in the future, contributing to the overall goal of patient health.

By assessing and treating Young, Dr. Hathaway successfully helps one patient become healthy, and by admitting Jones, Hathaway sets the stage for future care.
