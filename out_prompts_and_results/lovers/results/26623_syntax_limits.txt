In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, but they are not currently happy. Blake (C2) wants chocolates (I2), and Casey (C3) wants flowers (I3). The only item Alex has is the jewelry, which is currently with Casey. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the action that will be taken:

1. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex in the dining room.

After this action, Alex will have the jewelry they want, making them happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is necessary because it allows Casey to transfer the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy. Since Alex's happiness is the goal, this single action is sufficient to achieve that.
