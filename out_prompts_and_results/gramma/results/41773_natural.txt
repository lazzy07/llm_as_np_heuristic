To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. The bandit attacks the guard. This action is necessary because the guard is armed and poses a threat to the bandit. By eliminating the guard, the bandit can operate freely without the risk of being reported or attacked.

2. The bandit loots the guard's sword from the corpse. This action allows the bandit to arm herself, which is essential for her to defend against any future threats and to potentially rob other characters.

3. The bandit then robs the hero, taking the hero's coin. This action is crucial for the bandit to increase her coin count, as the hero is unarmed and poses no threat.

4. Finally, the bandit walks back to the bandit camp with the coins she has acquired. This action ensures that the bandit can secure her loot in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- The bandit attacks the guard, killing him. This removes the main threat to her safety and allows her to act without fear of being reported.
- The bandit loots the guard's sword from his corpse, arming herself for future encounters.

- The bandit walks back to the bandit camp, ensuring her coins are safe in the chest.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins and securing them in the chest.
