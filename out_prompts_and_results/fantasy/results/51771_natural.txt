To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the actions that can lead to her happiness or wealth. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but she has no money or treasure, and her happiness is at 0. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: Gargax is hungry and wants to eat a human. By eating Rory, Gargax will satisfy his hunger, and Rory will be dead, allowing Talia to take the money from Rory's body.
2. **Talia takes the money from Rory's body**: After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can take the money that Rory had. This will increase Talia's wealth.
3. **Talia becomes happy**: With the money now in her possession, Talia will feel wealthy, which will lead to her happiness.

This sequence of actions is necessary because:
- Gargax eating Rory is the only way to remove Rory from the equation, allowing Talia to access the money.
- Talia taking the money directly fulfills her desire to be wealthy, which is a step towards her happiness.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Gargax eats Rory",
    "Talia takes the money from Rory's body",
    "Talia becomes happy"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Talia achieves her goal of becoming happy through the acquisition of wealth.
