To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake is not happy, and they want item I2, which is currently unknown to us. However, we know that Casey wants I2, and since Casey is in R21, we can assume that I2 is also in R21. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R21) where they believe I2 is located. This action is necessary for Casey to access the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up item I2 from the dining room. This action is crucial as it allows Casey to have the item they want.

3. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives item I2 to Blake. This action directly helps Blake achieve their goal of happiness since they want I2.

4. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to the living room (R22) after receiving I2. This action is not strictly necessary for Blake's happiness but helps in the narrative flow.

5. **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down item I2 in the living room. This action is not necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way to signify that Blake has achieved their goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as I2 to pick it up.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R21)**: Casey acquires the item they want.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the item to Blake, fulfilling Blake's desire.
- **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Blake moves to a different room, which is a narrative choice.
- **put_down(C2, I2, R22)**: Blake puts down the item, marking the completion of their goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "pick_up(C3, I2, R21)",
    "give(C3, I2, C2, R21)",
    "move(C2, R21, R22)",
    "put_down(C2, I2, R22)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want.
