To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items and the characters' desires. Blake wants Alex to be happy, and Alex wants to have the item I3 (which is in the bathroom). Since Casey has I1 (the jewelry), and Alex has just given I1 to Casey, we need to facilitate a trade or movement that allows Alex to get I3.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to pick up I3, which is the item Alex wants.
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the bathroom to access I3.

2. **pick_up(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey picks up I3 from the bathroom.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item that Alex wants.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room where Alex and Blake are.
   - This action is necessary to bring I3 back to the location where Alex is.

4. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Casey gives I3 to Alex.
   - This action is necessary for Alex to receive the item they want, making Alex happy.

5. **happy(C1) = True**: Now that Alex has I3, they are happy.

6. **happy(C2) = True**: Since Alex is happy, Blake is also happy because they want Alex to be happy.

Now, Blake has achieved their goal of being happy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to go to the bathroom to get the item Alex wants.
- **pick_up(C3, I3, R12)**: Casey must pick up I3 to give it to Alex.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the dining room to give the item to Alex.
- **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for I3, making them happy.
