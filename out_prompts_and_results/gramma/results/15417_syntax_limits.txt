To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Loot**: The bandit will loot Tom's corpse to take the coins he was carrying. This action is necessary because Tom is now dead, and the bandit can take advantage of the situation to increase her coin count.

2. **Take**: The bandit will then take the coins from Tom's corpse and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the coins are secured in the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- The bandit attacks Tom in the cottage, resulting in Tom's death. This action allows the bandit to eliminate a potential threat and gain access to Tom's belongings.
- After Tom is dead, the bandit loots Tom's corpse to take the coins he was carrying. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of acquiring more coins.
- Finally, the bandit takes the coins from Tom's corpse and places them in the chest at the bandit camp. This secures the coins and fulfills her objective of having coins in the chest.

The story is concise, with only two actions needed to achieve the bandit's goal.
