To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the market where the merchant is located, as the bandit needs to interact with the merchant to obtain coins.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The bandit needs to reach the market to confront the merchant and potentially rob her of the medicine, which is a valuable item that can be traded for coins.

3. **The bandit attacks and kills the merchant.**  
   - Since the merchant is not armed, the bandit can successfully kill her and take the medicine. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to eliminate a potential threat and gain a valuable item.

4. **The bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant.**  
   - After killing the merchant, the bandit can take the medicine, which can be used to barter for coins or can be sold for profit.

5. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit needs to return to the camp to secure the medicine and any coins that may be in the chest.

6. **The bandit places the medicine in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action ensures that the medicine is stored safely, and the bandit can focus on acquiring more coins in the future.

At this point, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having valuable items (the medicine) in the chest at the bandit camp.
