To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant takes the medicine from the Merchant's location (Camp) to the Bandit Camp.** This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to have the medicine in her possession to potentially sell it later or use it as leverage.

2. **Bandit robs the Merchant to take the medicine.** The Bandit, being a criminal and armed, can rob the Merchant who is not armed. This action allows the Bandit to gain an item of value, which she can later use to negotiate or trade for coins.

3. **Bandit takes the medicine to the Bandit Camp.** This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure the medicine in her possession, which she can use to further her own goals.

4. **Merchant walks from the Camp to the Crossroads.** This action allows the Merchant to move to a more advantageous position where she can interact with other characters.

5. **Merchant buys a sword from the Bandit using one of her coins.** This action allows the Merchant to arm herself, which is crucial for her safety and future transactions.

6. **Merchant walks to the Market.** This action allows the Merchant to be in the location where she can interact with the Guard and potentially sell her items.

7. **Merchant reports the Bandit’s location to the Guard.** This action helps the Merchant achieve her goal by getting the Bandit in trouble, which could lead to the Bandit losing her coins or being unable to operate freely.

8. **Guard attacks the Bandit.** This action is necessary for the Guard to eliminate the Bandit, ensuring that the Merchant can operate without the threat of robbery.

9. **Merchant loots the Bandit’s corpse to take the coins.** This action allows the Merchant to acquire the coins that the Bandit had, thus achieving her goal of collecting as many coins as possible.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant successfully navigates the challenges posed by the Bandit while also securing her own safety and maximizing her coin collection.
