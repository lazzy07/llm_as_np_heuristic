To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will take place:

1. **The merchant walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary because the merchant needs to sell the medicine to Tom, and she must be at the market to do so.

2. **The hero walks from the cottage to the market.**  
   - Tom needs to go to the market to buy the medicine from the merchant.

3. **The hero gives the hero's coin to the merchant to buy the medicine.**  
   - This action allows Tom to acquire the medicine, which is essential for him to achieve his goal.

4. **The hero walks from the market to the cottage.**  
   - After acquiring the medicine, Tom needs to return to the cottage to fulfill his goal of being there with the medicine.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

- The merchant moves to the market to sell the medicine.
- Tom goes to the market to buy the medicine.
- Tom uses his coin to purchase the medicine from the merchant.
- Tom returns to the cottage with the medicine.

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom ends up at the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.
