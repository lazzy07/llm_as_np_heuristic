Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, assesses Young, who is experiencing a fever. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Young's symptoms are clear. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Ross to an exam room. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Dr. Hathaway will need to assess him to determine the correct treatment.
