In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I3 (chocolates) to be happy, and they are currently in the dining room (R21). Casey (C3) has item I1 (flowers) and is in the living room (R22). Blake (C2) has item I3 (chocolates) and is also in the dining room (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the flowers (I1) they received from Casey for the chocolates (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I3) while also ensuring that Blake is happy with the flowers (I1) they receive in return.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the chocolates (I3).
- Blake will also be happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Casey remains unhappy because they still do not have the item they want (I2), but since the goal is for Alex to be happy, this action fulfills that requirement.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R21)"]
}
``` 

This story is complete and concise, achieving Alex's goal of happiness with just one action.
