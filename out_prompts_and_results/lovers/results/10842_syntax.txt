To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade the flowers (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it directly allows Alex to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

2. **Check Happiness**: After the trade, Alex will have the jewelry, which fulfills their desire and makes them happy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the flowers they have for the jewelry that Casey has. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Alex obtaining the item they want.

After this trade, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they desired.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I2, C3, I1, R21)"]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Trade Action**: This is the only action needed to ensure Alex achieves their goal of happiness. By trading the flowers for the jewelry, Alex gets what they want, fulfilling their desire and making them happy. Other actions are not necessary as they do not contribute to achieving Alex's goal directly.
