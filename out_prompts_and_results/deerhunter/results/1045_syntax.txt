To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba is hungry and greedy, and he has a rifle and ammunition. Loading the rifle will prepare him to either threaten the bank clerk for money or hunt Bambi for food.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to confront the bank clerk. This is necessary for him to attempt to get the money.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will shoot the bank clerk. This action is taken because Bubba is greedy and wants the money, and the clerk has money that Bubba desires.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money from the bank. This fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, and Bambi remains alive, but the primary goal of Bubba acquiring the money is achieved.
