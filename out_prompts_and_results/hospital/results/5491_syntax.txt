To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A with Ross, the first action is to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Next, Hathaway should assess Jones in Exam Room B. This is important to determine Jones's symptoms as well, since he is also a patient who needs treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is crucial to ensure that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has Flaze, he will be treated with antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will be treated with steroids.

5. **Treat Jones**: Next, Hathaway will treat Jones based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. The same logic applies here: antibiotics for Flaze and steroids for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young based on the assessment results. This ensures that all patients receive the necessary treatment.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing patients**: This is essential to determine the correct treatment for each patient. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot know which disease each patient has.
- **Treating patients**: Once symptoms are known, Hathaway can administer the correct treatment, which is crucial for the patients' recovery.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), Admissions)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomA)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment(Jones), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), Admissions)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway can successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
