In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, as it will make him wealthy, and he also needs to ensure he is not hungry.

Here's the completed story:

1. Rory travels from the village to the cave. (This action is necessary for Rory to reach the treasure, which is essential for achieving his goal of wealth.)

2. Rory picks up the treasure at the cave. (This action allows Rory to become wealthy, fulfilling one of his primary goals.)

3. Rory travels back to the village. (This action is necessary for Rory to return to a safe location where he can enjoy his wealth and ensure he is not hungry.)

4. Rory becomes hungry. (This action is included to show that Rory's hunger is a concern, but it does not prevent him from achieving his goal of wealth.)

5. Rory uses the treasure to buy food in the village. (This action ensures that Rory is not hungry anymore, completing his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.)

In this story, Rory successfully achieves his goal by first obtaining the treasure and then ensuring he has food to satisfy his hunger.
