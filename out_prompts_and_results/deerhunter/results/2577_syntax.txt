To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is already in the Forest and has previously gone to the Bank. He needs to return to the Bank to confront the Clerk and attempt to steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, now at the Bank, can use his loaded rifle to threaten the Clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can return to the Forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but helps to illustrate that he has left the Bank with the money.

4. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba can shoot Bambi, which fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead. This action is necessary to ensure that both conditions of the goal are met.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the Clerk and attempt to steal the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the Clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action shows Bubba leaving the Bank after successfully stealing the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.
