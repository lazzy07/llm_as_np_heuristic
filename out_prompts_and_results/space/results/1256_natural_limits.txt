Zoe looks around at the erupting surface and realizes that both she and the Lizard are in danger. To ensure their safety and continue building their friendship, she decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where they can both be safe from the volcanic eruptions. 

Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship. This action is necessary because it allows Zoe to escape the dangerous environment of the surface and ensures her safety. Since the Lizard is her friend, she hopes that he will follow her to the spaceship, where they can continue to bond and explore ways to be healthy and safe together.

After Zoe teleports, the Lizard, recognizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport to the spaceship as well, following Zoe. This action is implied as a natural response to the situation, as both characters prioritize their safety and friendship.

In the end, both Zoe and the Lizard are safe aboard the spaceship, and they can work together to explore the planet further in a healthy and friendly manner.
