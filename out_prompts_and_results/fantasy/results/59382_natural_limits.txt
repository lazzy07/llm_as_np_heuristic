In the village, Talia and Rory are married, but they are both unhappy and lack wealth. Gargax, the dragon, is also present and is aware that Vince has the money. To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the best course of action is for Gargax to eat Rory. This action will allow Talia to inherit Rory's wealth, which will make her happy.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Gargax eats Rory.

This action is necessary because it removes Rory from the equation, allowing Talia to inherit his wealth. Since Talia's happiness is tied to her wealth, this action directly leads to her becoming wealthy and, consequently, happy.

After this action, Talia will have Rory's wealth, making her happy.
