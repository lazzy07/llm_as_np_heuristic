To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. Since they are both on the surface and not fighting, this action is possible. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe will walk to the cave. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters can be in a safe location away from the danger of the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it keeps both characters together and safe from the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action is included to show the danger that was avoided by moving to the cave.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
