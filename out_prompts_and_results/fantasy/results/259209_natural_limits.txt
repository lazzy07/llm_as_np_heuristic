In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are present. Talia has the treasure, which she values as a means to achieve her goal of being wealthy and happy. To ensure her happiness, Talia decides to take action that will secure her wealth.

**Action:** Talia takes the money from Vince.

**Explanation:** By taking the money from Vince, Talia increases her wealth to 2 (1 from the treasure and 1 from the money). This action is crucial because Talia's goal is to be wealthy, and acquiring the money directly contributes to that goal. Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, her happiness is indirectly supported by her wealth, fulfilling her desire for happiness as well.
