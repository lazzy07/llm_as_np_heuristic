To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and has already stolen the rifle from the clerk. He is hungry and has a greed for money. The clerk is also in the bank and is aware of Bubba's presence.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting to secure the money, decides to shoot the clerk. This action will eliminate the clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any opposition.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now pick up the money from the bank without any risk of being stopped.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle preventing him from taking the money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk without any repercussions.
  
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money from the bank, achieving his goal of acquiring wealth.
