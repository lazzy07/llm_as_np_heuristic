Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, is in the forest with a loaded rifle. He spots Bambi, the deer, and decides to shoot her to satisfy his hunger. After shooting Bambi, he eats her, which fulfills his hunger. With Bambi dead, Bubba now has the option to take the money from the bank clerk, who is still at the bank. However, since the goal is to end with Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead, the story concludes with Bambi's death.

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to shoot Bambi, fulfilling his goal of killing the deer.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats her, satisfying his hunger.

This sequence of actions leads to Bambi being dead, which meets the requirement of the story's ending.
