To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to initiate contact with the Lizard, who is currently on the surface.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks to the cave, indicating a willingness to engage with Zoe in a safe environment. This action helps to ensure that both characters can communicate without the threat of the volcano erupting.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe follows the Lizard to the cave and makes another attempt to befriend the Lizard. This action solidifies their friendship and ensures both characters feel safe.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: After successfully making peace, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety as the volcano is still a threat on the surface.

This sequence of actions allows Zoe to achieve her goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard while avoiding conflict and the dangers posed by the erupting volcano.
