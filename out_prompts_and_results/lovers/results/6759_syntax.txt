To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **put_down(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to clear the space and may be relevant for future interactions.

4. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the living room (R21). This action is also not necessary for Alex's immediate happiness but allows Blake to explore other options or items.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers they wanted, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **put_down(C2, I2, R12)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it helps to keep the area organized.
- **move(C2, R12, R21)**: This action allows Blake to move on and possibly help Casey or explore other items.
