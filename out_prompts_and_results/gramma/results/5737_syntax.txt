To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is unarmed and carrying a coin. This action allows the bandit to take one of Tom's coins, increasing her total.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins safely.

3. **Take Coins from the Chest**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit will take the coins from the chest, further increasing her total.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to gain a coin without risking confrontation with the guard or merchant, as Tom is unarmed.
- **Walking to the Bandit Camp**: This action is essential for the bandit to secure her stolen coin and any coins she has in the chest, moving to a location where she is safe from the guard.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action allows the bandit to maximize her coin count, fulfilling her goal.
