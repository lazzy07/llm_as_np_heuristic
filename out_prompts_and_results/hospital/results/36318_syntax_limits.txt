**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Fever, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room B. Since Young is the only patient in that room, Hathaway can determine if Young has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. This action is necessary for Hathaway to understand Young's condition and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Antibiotics, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Young and confirming that they have a fever, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, Rash, PatientRoomC**: Hathaway then assesses Ross in Exam Room C. This is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment. 

4. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, Steroids, PatientRoomC**: After assessing Ross and confirming that he has a rash, Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action ensures that Ross also becomes healthy.
