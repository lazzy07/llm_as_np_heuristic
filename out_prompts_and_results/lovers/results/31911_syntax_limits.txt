In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and they believe that Casey (C3) has it. Since Alex is in the same room as Casey, they can take action to achieve their goal.

**Action:**
1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)** - Alex trades the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (the jewelry) while also ensuring that Casey is happy with the chocolates. Since Alex's goal is to be happy, and they want Casey to be happy as well, this trade satisfies both characters' desires.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry.
- Casey will be happy because they have the chocolates.
