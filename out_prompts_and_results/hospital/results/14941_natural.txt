**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess the patients to determine their symptoms. Since her workload is at 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, but she decides to proceed with assessing Young first.

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze (fever) instead of Jarkis (rash).

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment for Flaze. However, since Young actually has Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway, now realizing the urgency of the situation, walks to the Admissions room to assess Jones.

4. **Admit Jones to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A, increasing her workload to 3 again.

5. **Assess Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Flaze.

6. **Treat Jones in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment. Since Jones actually has Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

7. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Ross.

8. **Assess Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze.

9. **Treat Ross in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, believing it to be the correct treatment. Since Ross actually has Jarkis, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

Despite the mistakes made due to her high workload, Dr. Hathaway's actions ultimately lead to the realization that she needs to manage her workload better in the future. However, in this scenario, all patients end up dying due to misdiagnosis.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young, Jones, and Ross was necessary to determine their symptoms, even though the doctor made mistakes due to her workload.
- Treating each patient was essential to attempt to make them healthy, aligning with Dr. Hathaway's goal.
- Walking between rooms was necessary to facilitate the assessments and treatments of the patients.
