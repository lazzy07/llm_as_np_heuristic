To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R12) to the bathroom (R22) to be closer to Casey, who is currently in the living room (R21) and has the flowers (I1) in the bathroom (R22).

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the bathroom (R22). This is necessary because Alex wants the flowers to be happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) after picking up the flowers. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps in the narrative flow.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it ensures that Casey is happy, which is also a goal for Alex.

5. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the living room (R21) to be with Blake (C2). This action is not necessary for Alex's happiness but helps in the overall happiness of the group.

6. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R21). This ensures that Blake is happy, which in turn makes Alex happy.

7. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the living room (R21). This ensures that Casey is happy, completing the cycle of happiness among the characters.

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers (I1), which they wanted.
