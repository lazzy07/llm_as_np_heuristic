The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the merchant at the crossroads. Knowing that the merchant has the medicine, which she can use to gain leverage, the bandit decides to rob the merchant. The bandit approaches the merchant and, using her sword, she successfully robs the merchant of the medicine.

**Explanation of the action:**
- The bandit robs the merchant because her goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. By taking the medicine, she can potentially sell it later for coins or use it to negotiate with others, thus increasing her chances of acquiring more coins.
