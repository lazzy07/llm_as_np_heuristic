To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This will help identify Young's symptoms and determine the appropriate treatment.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment for his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: Similarly, Hathaway will treat Young with the correct treatment for his symptoms. This will ensure Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones, who is already in exam room A and has been assessed. This will ensure that all patients are treated and healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
