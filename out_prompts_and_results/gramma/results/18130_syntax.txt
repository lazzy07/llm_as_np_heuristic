To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to return to the Cottage to achieve his goal. This action is necessary for him to reach his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Cottage)**: The Bandit is also at the Crossroads and will follow Tom to the Cottage. This action is included to maintain the narrative flow, as the Bandit is pursuing Tom.

3. **attack(Bandit, Tom, Cottage)**: Once at the Cottage, the Bandit will attack Tom. This action is included to create tension in the story, as the Bandit is a criminal and may want to rob Tom.

4. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Tom, Cottage)**: After attacking Tom, the Bandit will loot the medicine from him. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring items.

5. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will then walk back to the Crossroads. This action is included to show the Bandit leaving the Cottage after the encounter.

6. **walk(Tom, Cottage, Crossroads)**: Tom will walk back to the Crossroads after the Bandit leaves. This action is included to show Tom's return to the Crossroads.

7. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Finally, Tom will walk back to the Cottage again. This action is necessary for Tom to achieve his goal of being at the Cottage carrying the medicine.

The final sequence of actions ensures that Tom ends up at the Cottage, even though the Bandit successfully loots the medicine from him.
