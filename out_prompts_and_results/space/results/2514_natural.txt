Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface. To achieve her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, Zoe needs to establish a connection with the Lizard while ensuring both of them are safe from the dangers of the surface.

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to meet the Lizard and establish a relationship. Since the Lizard is currently at the surface, this allows them to be in the same location.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Since they are not fighting and both want to be friends, this action allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk back to the cave together.** - This action ensures that both characters are safe from the dangers of the surface, including the potential eruption of the volcano. By moving to the cave, they can continue to build their friendship in a safe environment.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard share stories and experiences in the cave.** - This action solidifies their friendship and allows them to understand each other better, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
