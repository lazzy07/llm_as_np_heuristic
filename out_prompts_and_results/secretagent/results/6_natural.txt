To achieve the secret agent's goal of killing the mastermind, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The secret agent moves from the lobby to the office.**  
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to find the gun, which is currently unknown in location. The office is a potential location for the gun.

2. **The secret agent discovers the gun in the office.**  
   - This action is crucial as the secret agent needs the gun to carry out the killing of the mastermind.

3. **The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby.**  
   - The secret agent must return to the lobby to confront the mastermind, as the mastermind is believed to be there.

4. **The secret agent kills the mastermind in the lobby.**  
   - This action fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that the secret agent can locate the gun and then confront and kill the mastermind, achieving the desired outcome.
