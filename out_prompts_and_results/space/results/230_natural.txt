Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to make peace with the Lizard instead of fighting. She approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends and work together to ensure their safety. The Lizard, understanding Zoe's intentions and recognizing the mutual threat posed by the volcano, agrees to become friends. 

Once they have established a friendship, they both decide to leave the surface and head to the cave for safety. However, as they walk towards the cave, the volcano erupts unexpectedly. The eruption is powerful, and despite their efforts to escape, Zoe is caught in the eruption and dies.

This sequence of actions is necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, a character dies, and two characters make friends. The actions taken are:

1. **Make Peace**: Zoe approaches the Lizard to establish a friendship, which is essential for both characters to achieve their goals of safety and companionship.
2. **Walk to Cave**: After making peace, they attempt to move to a safer location together, which aligns with their goals of being healthy and safe.
3. **Volcano Erupts**: The eruption occurs as a consequence of their actions, leading to Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
