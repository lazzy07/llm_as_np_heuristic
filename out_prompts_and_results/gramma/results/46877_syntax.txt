To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, BanditCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coins she has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count without risking confrontation with the Guard or Tom, who are both armed and present in the Market.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After successfully robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is essential for the Bandit to secure her stolen coins in the chest at the camp, thus achieving her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just robbed and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the coins are safely stored, fulfilling her objective of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The **rob** action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without engaging in a lethal confrontation, which could attract the Guard's attention.
- The **walk** action is necessary to move from the Market, where the risk of being caught is higher, to the safety of the Bandit Camp.
- The **take** action secures the coins in the chest, which is the ultimate goal of the Bandit.
