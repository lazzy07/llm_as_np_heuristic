The bandit, having just looted the hero's coin from the merchant, decides to take advantage of the chaos. She knows the guard is present and could pose a threat, but she also realizes that the guard is focused on the aftermath of the attack. 

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. This action allows her to return to her safe haven where she can store her loot without the immediate threat of the guard.

2. Once at the bandit camp, the bandit places the hero's coin into the chest. This action fulfills her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, ensuring her safety and success.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial for the bandit to escape the market where the guard is present and where she could be caught. By returning to the bandit camp, she secures her position.
- The second action directly achieves her goal of having coins in the chest, which is the primary objective she set out to accomplish.
