**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Exam Room B. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C. This brings Hathaway's workload to 4, but it is essential to ensure that all patients are accounted for.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C. Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms as well. At this point, Hathaway has assessed all patients, but still cannot identify their diseases.

To ensure all patients are treated, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, this treatment is a gamble. However, it is necessary to attempt to treat him.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross in Exam Room B with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Again, this is a gamble due to the Unknown symptoms.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Exam Room C with antibiotics, also believing he might have Flaze. 

In the end, all patients are treated, and Dr. Hathaway has done everything possible to ensure their health, achieving the goal of having all patients treated.
