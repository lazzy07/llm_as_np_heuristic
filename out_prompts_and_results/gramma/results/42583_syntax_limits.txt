In this story, the Merchant's goal is to acquire as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal. Given the current situation, the Merchant is at the Camp, and the Bandit is at the Market, where they can potentially rob Tom, who is also at the Market. 

To achieve her goal, the Merchant can take the following action:

1. **Walk from Camp to Market**: The Merchant moves to the Market to be in a position to interact with Tom and the Bandit.

This action is necessary because the Merchant needs to be at the Market to either sell items or potentially acquire coins from Tom or the Bandit. 

After this action, the Merchant can then buy coins from Tom or rob the Bandit, depending on the situation. However, since we are limited to one action, the Merchant's movement to the Market is the only action taken in this story.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Merchant, Camp, Market)**: This action allows the Merchant to reach the Market, where she can engage with Tom and the Bandit to further her goal of acquiring coins.
