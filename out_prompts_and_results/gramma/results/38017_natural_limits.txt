Tom, armed with the merchant's sword and carrying the medicine, stands at the market. The bandit, who has just robbed Tom of his coin, is also present. The guard, who is aware of Tom's criminal status, is on high alert. 

To achieve his goal of getting back to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to take a bold action. He reports the bandit to the guard, knowing that this will divert the guard's attention away from him. 

The guard, upon hearing Tom's report, immediately turns to confront the bandit, allowing Tom to slip away unnoticed. With the guard now focused on the bandit, Tom walks back to the cottage, successfully carrying the medicine with him.
