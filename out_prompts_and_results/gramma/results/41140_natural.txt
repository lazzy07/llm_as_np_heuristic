To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** The bandit is armed and can rob the merchant, who is not armed. This action allows the bandit to take the medicine from the merchant, which is not the primary goal but could be useful later.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her preferred location, where she can store her coins in the chest.

3. **The bandit places the hero's coin in the chest.** This action ensures that the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The story is concise and focuses on the bandit's actions to achieve her goal without unnecessary interactions with other characters.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing the merchant**: This is necessary for the bandit to gain an advantage and potentially acquire more items, even if the primary goal is coins.
- **Walking to the bandit camp**: This is essential for the bandit to secure her coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal.
- **Placing the coin in the chest**: This final action directly achieves the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.
