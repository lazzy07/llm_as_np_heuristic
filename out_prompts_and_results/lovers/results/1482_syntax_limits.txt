In the current situation, Alex (C1) is unhappy because they want the flowers (I1), which are in the same room (R22) as them. Casey (C3) is happy because they have the jewelry (I3), but Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the chocolates (I2), which are in a different room (R21). 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action is for Alex to pick up the flowers from the room they are currently in (R22). This action will make Alex happy, as they will have the item they want.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the room they are in. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake remains unhappy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry.

This action is sufficient to achieve Alex's goal of happiness.
