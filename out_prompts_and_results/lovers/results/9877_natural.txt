To achieve Alex's goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Casey moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate a trade or give the flowers to Alex.

2. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex.**  
   - This action allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is what they want to be happy.

3. **Alex is now happy.**  
   - With the flowers in hand, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

The actions are designed to ensure that Alex can get the flowers directly from Casey, as they are currently in the same location after Casey moves.
