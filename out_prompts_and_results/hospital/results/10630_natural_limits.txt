Dr. Hathaway, realizing that their workload is high, decides to prioritize assessing the patients to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Admissions to Patient Room A.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Jones, who is currently in Patient Room A. 

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.** This action allows Hathaway to identify Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway will need to determine if it is Flaze or Jarkis.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Ross, who is currently in Patient Room B.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.** This action allows Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms. 

5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess Young, who is currently in Patient Room C.

6. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.** This action allows Hathaway to identify Young's symptoms.

After assessing all three patients, Dr. Hathaway determines that Jones has Flaze, Ross has Jarkis, and Young has Flaze. 

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.** This action is necessary to cure Jones of Flaze.

8. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.** This action is necessary to cure Ross of Jarkis.

By treating all three patients correctly, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
