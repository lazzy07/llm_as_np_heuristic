To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba is currently at the Bank and needs to go to the Forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to confront Bambi and potentially obtain food, which will help with his hunger.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the Forest, Bubba will shoot Bambi with the loaded rifle. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to obtain food, which he is hungry for, and also aligns with his greedy desire for money, as he can sell Bambi's meat.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat the deer. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger and allows him to regain strength.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will return to the Bank. This action is necessary for him to potentially interact with the Clerk again.

5. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: In the Bank, Bubba will steal the money from the Clerk using the rifle as a threat. This action is the culmination of Bubba's greed and desire for money.

6. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to keep the money he has stolen. This action solidifies his goal of obtaining money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger, acquires food, and ultimately steals money from the Clerk, achieving his goal of obtaining money.
