To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to secure the money from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will attempt to steal the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After successfully stealing from the clerk, Bubba will pick up the money that the clerk has.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk without needing to shoot him. It leverages the threat of violence (having a loaded rifle) to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action is necessary to finalize the acquisition of the money after the theft. It ensures that Bubba has the money in his possession.

With these actions, we achieve the goal of having Bubba with the money, while Bambi remains dead from the earlier shooting.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
