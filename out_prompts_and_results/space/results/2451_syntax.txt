To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with it and work towards friendship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once Zoe is on the surface, she will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

3. **end**: If the peace is successful, Zoe and the Lizard will become friends, achieving both of their goals of safety and friendship.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

Zoe, the space explorer, teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet. She knows that to make friends with the Lizard, she needs to be on the same ground. Once on the surface, she approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, hoping to connect with the guardian of the planet. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's genuine intentions, accepts her offer, and they both agree to work together to ensure their safety and health.

The story ends with Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends, fulfilling their mutual desires for companionship and safety.
