Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both safe and healthy, but they have no relationship and are considered enemies. To achieve the goal of making friends while also ensuring the volcano erupts, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is necessary to transition from being enemies to friends. Since they are not fighting, they can establish a friendship, which aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** This event occurs after Zoe and the Lizard have made peace. The eruption is a natural consequence of the story's setting and adds tension to the narrative. 

3. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the volcano erupts. Since she is now friends with the Lizard, she can leave without causing anger.

4. **The Lizard remains on the surface as the volcano erupts.** This results in the Lizard dying, as it cannot escape the eruption.

The story concludes with Zoe and the Lizard having made peace, but the Lizard ultimately dies due to the eruption of the volcano.
