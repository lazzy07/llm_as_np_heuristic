In the current situation, Hathaway has a workload of 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake when assessing or treating patients. To ensure Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomA to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment. Given that Hathaway's workload is high, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but assessing is still necessary.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is essential for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess and treat Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This action is not directly related to Ross's goal but is necessary for the overall health of the patients in the hospital.
