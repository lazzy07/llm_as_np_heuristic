To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money. Since he is currently at the bank and the bank clerk has money, he can take action to achieve his goal. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba successfully obtaining the money from the bank clerk:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants the clerk's money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and returns to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to fulfill his greed by taking the clerk's money at gunpoint.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action ensures that Bubba can safely store the money he has just stolen.
