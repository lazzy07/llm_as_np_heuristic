To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the living room where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to help Alex by giving them an item, even though it is not what Alex wants.

3. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room. This is necessary for Blake to be in a position to interact with Casey and Alex later.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to facilitate a trade.

5. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) for the jewelry (I1) with Blake. This is the crucial action that allows Alex to eventually get the jewelry they want.

6. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary for Casey to give the jewelry to Alex.

7. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
