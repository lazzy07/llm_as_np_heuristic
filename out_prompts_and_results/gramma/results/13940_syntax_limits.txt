To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The bandit will walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the bandit to reach the location where she can store her coins in the chest.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in her possession.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is essential for the bandit to move to a safe location (the Bandit Camp) where she can secure her coins without the threat of being attacked by the guard, who is now dead.
- The second action directly fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying coins, as she takes the coins from the chest.
