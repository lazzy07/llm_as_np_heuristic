To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to access the item they want, which is in the bathroom (R12).
2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) from the dining room.
3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Alex and Blake.
4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2), fulfilling Blake's desire for the item.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to access the jewelry, which is in the dining room.
- **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: This action allows Casey to acquire the jewelry, which is essential for Blake's happiness.
- **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey needs to return to the living room to interact with Blake and Alex.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they will have the jewelry they wanted.
