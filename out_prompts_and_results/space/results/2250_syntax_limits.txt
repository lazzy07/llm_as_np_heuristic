In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet, having established a friendly relationship. However, the volcano on the surface is about to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have Zoe take an action that leads to this outcome.

1. **Action: begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano, which is a critical part of the story's climax. 

2. **Action: walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)** - Zoe walks from the cave to the surface, where the volcano is located. This action is essential for Zoe to be in the location where the eruption will occur.

3. **Action: erupt(Surface)** - This action represents the volcano erupting, which will lead to the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface during the eruption.

4. **Action: make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - This action is included to ensure that before Zoe's demise, she and the Lizard solidify their friendship, achieving their goal of making friends.

The final story sequence is as follows:

- Zoe initiates the volcano eruption.
- She walks to the surface, where the eruption occurs, leading to her death.
- The Lizard remains safe in the cave, having made peace with Zoe before the eruption.

This sequence ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, while also fulfilling the goal of friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.
