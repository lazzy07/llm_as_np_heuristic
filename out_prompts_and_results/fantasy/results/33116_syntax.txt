To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted a marriage proposal from Vince, which can lead to her happiness. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Talia achieve her goal:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: Talia and Vince can get married since Talia has accepted Vince's proposal. This action will make both Talia and Vince happy, fulfilling Talia's goal of happiness.

2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: After getting married, Talia can travel back to the village to be with Rory, who is still in the village.

3. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Talia can take the money from Vince, who is in the cave with her. This will increase her wealth.

Now, Talia will have both happiness (from marrying Vince) and wealth (from taking the money), thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)**: This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's happiness by formalizing her relationship with Vince.
- **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: This action is necessary for Talia to move to the village, where Rory is located, but it is not essential for achieving her goal since her happiness is already secured by marrying Vince.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)**: This action is essential for Talia to increase her wealth, which is part of her goal.
