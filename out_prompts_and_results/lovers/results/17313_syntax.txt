To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, we need to ensure that Casey receives the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Alex is already happy with the chocolates (I1), the focus will be on helping Casey.

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: Blake (C3) can trade the chocolates (I2) they picked up with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the jewelry they want, which will make them happy.

2. **give(C2, I3, C1, R21)**: After the trade, Casey (C2) can give the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1). This action is necessary because it ensures that Alex receives the item they want, which is the jewelry.

After these actions, the happiness status will be:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Casey (C2) will also be happy because they have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake (C3) will be happy because they have the chocolates (I2) that they wanted.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **Trade**: This action allows Casey to get the item they want (jewelry) in exchange for the chocolates, which Blake has.
2. **Give**: This action allows Casey to give the jewelry to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire for happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)",
    "give(C2, I3, C1, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by receiving the item they want, while also considering the happiness of the other characters.
