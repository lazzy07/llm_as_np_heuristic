To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has just shot Bambi, which means he can eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money. The bank clerk has money, and Bubba can take actions to acquire it.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and focus on his next goal, which is to get money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and attempt to get money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using the rifle. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **Eating Bambi**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is important for his well-being and allows him to think clearly about his next steps.
- **Going to the Bank**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can confront the bank clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing from the Clerk**: Directly achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
