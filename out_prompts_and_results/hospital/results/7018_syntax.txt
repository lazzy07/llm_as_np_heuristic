To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is already in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action will be to assess Ross to confirm his symptoms. This is necessary to determine the correct treatment for him.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the confirmed symptoms. If Ross has Flaze (fever), he will be treated with antibiotics, and if he has Jarkis (rash), he will be treated with steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to assess Jones and Young, who are both waiting there. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to.

4. **Assess Jones**: Once Hathaway reaches the admissions room, the next action will be to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is important to provide the correct treatment.

5. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him based on his symptoms. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

6. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure that all patients are healthy.

7. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on his symptoms, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of making them healthy.
