To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in Patient Room C, they will first need to walk to Patient Room A to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.

2. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will walk to Patient Room B to assess Ross. This is important to identify Ross's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in Patient Room C. This completes the assessment of all patients, allowing Hathaway to determine the correct treatments for each.

4. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: If Jones is found to have a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

5. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is found to have a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

6. **Treat Young with Steroids**: If Young is also found to have a rash (symptom of Jarkis), Hathaway will treat him with steroids as well.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient**: This is crucial to identify their symptoms and determine the correct treatment. Without this step, Hathaway cannot provide the necessary care.
- **Treating with the correct medication**: Each treatment is based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This ensures that patients receive the appropriate care, leading to their recovery.
