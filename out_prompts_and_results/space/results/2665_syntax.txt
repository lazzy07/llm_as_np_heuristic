1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is taken to strengthen the bond between Zoe and the Lizard, ensuring they are friends. Since they are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, this action will solidify their friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe to the cave, ensuring they are both in a safe location away from the dangers of the surface.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface will begin to erupt, creating a sense of urgency for both characters to find safety.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making friends with the Lizard.
