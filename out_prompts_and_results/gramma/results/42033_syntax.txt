To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads. Since Tom is unarmed, the Bandit can take the coin that Tom is carrying. This action directly helps the Bandit by increasing her coin count.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the bandit camp, fulfilling her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from Tom and place them in the chest at the bandit camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first and crucial step for the Bandit to gain coins without becoming a criminal, as Tom is not armed and is an easy target.
- **Walking to Camp**: This action is necessary to move the Bandit to a safe location where she can store her newly acquired coins.
- **Taking Coins to the Chest**: This final action secures the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest, which is her ultimate aim.
