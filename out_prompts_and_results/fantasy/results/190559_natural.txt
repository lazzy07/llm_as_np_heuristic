To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - This action is necessary for Rory to leave the cave where Gargax is located and return to the village where Talia and Vince are. Rory needs to be in the same location as Vince to interact with him.

2. **Rory proposes to Vince.**  
   - Since Rory is already married to Talia, proposing to Vince is a way to create a bond that can lead to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Rory's goal is to be happy, and proposing to Vince can help achieve that.

3. **Vince accepts Rory's proposal.**  
   - This action is essential for Rory's happiness. By accepting the proposal, Vince agrees to the relationship, which will make Rory happy.

4. **Rory and Vince get married.**  
   - This action solidifies the relationship between Rory and Vince, contributing to Rory's happiness.

5. **Vince picks up the money.**  
   - Since Vince has the money, this action is necessary for Rory to become wealthy. Vince's wealth will be shared with Rory through their marriage.

6. **Rory takes the money from Vince.**  
   - This action allows Rory to achieve their goal of being wealthy, as they now have access to the money that Vince possesses.

7. **Rory and Vince become not hungry.**  
   - Since all characters are currently not hungry, this action is implied as they are already satisfied.

By following these actions, Rory achieves their goals of happiness and wealth while remaining not hungry.
