To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The actions taken will reflect the characters' goals of safety and friendship, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano.

1. **Zoe walks to the Cave**: This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard, which is necessary for them to interact and potentially become friends. The surface is dangerous due to the volcano, so moving to the cave is a safer option.

2. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Since they are now in the same location and not fighting, Zoe can initiate a friendship with the Lizard. This action aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and being safe.

3. **Erupt the volcano**: After Zoe and the Lizard have made peace, the volcano erupts. This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting and results in the death of Zoe, as she is still on the surface when the eruption occurs.

The sequence of actions leads to the desired outcome: the volcano erupts, Zoe dies, and the Lizard and Zoe become friends before the eruption.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and engage with him, moving from a dangerous location to a safer one.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendship, fulfilling their mutual goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in Zoe's death, which is a critical part of the story's conclusion.
