Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to correctly identify that Jones has Flaze due to the fever symptom. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives the care he needs, as he is still in Admissions and has not been assessed yet.
