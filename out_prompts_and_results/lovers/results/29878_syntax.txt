To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake (C2) will trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex (C1) for the chocolates (I2) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake (C2) will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy since they have traded an item they didn't want for one they do.
- Casey (C3) will remain happy with the flowers (I3) they have.

This single trade action is sufficient to ensure Alex's happiness.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to get the jewelry they desire, fulfilling their goal of happiness. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, they willingly trade the jewelry for the chocolates, which they are content with. This action directly leads to Alex achieving their goal.
