To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to obtain money. Given the current situation, he is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, since he is greedy and wants money, he will need to return to the bank to get the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows him to regain energy and focus on his next goal of getting money.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes back to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings him closer to his goal of obtaining money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to think clearly and act effectively.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can access the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Accomplishes Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
