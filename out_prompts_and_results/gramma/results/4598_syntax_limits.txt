In the current situation, the Bandit is at the Market, where she has just attacked both Tom and the Merchant. The Bandit’s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since Tom is dead and the Merchant is also dead, the Bandit can now loot the Merchant for the medicine and any coins she may have had.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **loot(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit loots the Merchant's corpse to take the medicine and any coins the Merchant may have had. This action is necessary for the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying more items.

After this action, the Bandit has the medicine and can now return to the bandit camp to store her loot.

The story is complete with just one action, as the Bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying more items.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
