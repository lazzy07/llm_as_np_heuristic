After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that Roy has the pack of cigarettes, but they are currently threatened by the bully. To ensure his safety and to avoid confrontation, Ernest decides to take action. He quickly crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where the bully is currently engaged in recreation time. 

Once inside the gym, Ernest locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. With the bully unable to escape, Ernest takes out the knife he had previously seen in the kitchen. He confronts the bully, who is now at his mercy. In a moment of desperation and self-preservation, Ernest kills the bully, ensuring that he and Roy are no longer threatened.
