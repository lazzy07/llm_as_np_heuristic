In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex decides to give the jewelry they are holding to Casey in exchange for the flowers.

**Action:**
1. Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.

**Explanation:**
- This action is necessary because Alex wants the flowers, and the only way to obtain them is to trade the jewelry with Casey, who currently has the flowers. By giving the jewelry to Casey, Alex successfully acquires the flowers, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.
