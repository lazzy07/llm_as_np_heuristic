To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and has a workload of 3, they will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will then assess Young in PatientRoomC. This is important to determine Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results.

5. **Admit Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will admit Jones to an exam room (either A, B, or C) to assess and treat him as well.

Now, let's assume the following outcomes based on the assessments:
- Ross has Flaze (fever), so he will be treated with antibiotics.
- Young has Jarkis (rash), so he will be treated with steroids.
- Jones is admitted and assessed to have Flaze, so he will also be treated with antibiotics.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.
   
2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms, which is necessary for his treatment.

3. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics after determining he has Flaze. This action helps Hathaway achieve their goal of making Ross healthy.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids after determining he has Jarkis. This action also contributes to Hathaway's goal of ensuring Young's health.

5. **admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway admits Jones to PatientRoomA to assess and treat him. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are healthy.

6. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms.

7. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics after determining he has Flaze. This final action ensures that all patients are healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients (Ross, Young, and Jones) are treated successfully, and Hathaway achieves their goal.
