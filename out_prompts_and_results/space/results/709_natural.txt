Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They have just made peace, and both are healthy but not safe. To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, they need to find a way to escape the dangerous surface.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting volcano. Since she is friends with the Lizard, she can leave without causing anger or conflict.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** Zoe returns to the surface to help the Lizard, as she wants to ensure that her friend is safe as well.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** They both walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action helps both characters achieve their goal of being healthy and safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** Although they are already friends, reaffirming their friendship in the cave solidifies their bond and ensures that they can work together to stay safe.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
