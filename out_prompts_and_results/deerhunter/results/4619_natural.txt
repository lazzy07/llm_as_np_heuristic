To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to eat**: Since Bubba is hungry, he will eat Bambi, which is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to focus on his goal of getting money afterward.

2. **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action fulfills Bubba's hunger, allowing him to feel satisfied and focused on his next goal.

3. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank**: After eating, Bubba will go to the bank where the clerk is located. He needs to confront the clerk to get the money.

4. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.
