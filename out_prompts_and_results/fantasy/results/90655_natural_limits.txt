In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to ensure that she has both happiness and wealth. Since Talia is already married to Rory and Vince, her happiness is not an issue. However, she currently has only 1 wealth from the treasure and needs to acquire the money from Vince to increase her wealth.

Here’s the shortest story to achieve Talia's goal:
