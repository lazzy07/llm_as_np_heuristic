Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.**  
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Dr. Hathaway can then assess him for any symptoms he may have. This action also increases Dr. Hathaway's workload to 3, which is important for the next step.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.**  
   - This action allows Dr. Hathaway to check Young's symptoms. Since Young is in Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Young has a rash (the symptom of Jarkis), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment. This action ensures that Young becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats Young, achieving the goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
