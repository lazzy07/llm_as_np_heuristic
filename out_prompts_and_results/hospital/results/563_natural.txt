Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Ross in Admissions, where he is currently located. Upon assessing Ross, Hathaway identifies that Ross is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway then admits Ross to Patient Room A for treatment. 

Next, Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, which successfully makes Ross healthy. 

After treating Ross, Hathaway returns to Admissions to assess Young, who is still there. Upon assessing Young, Hathaway identifies that Young is experiencing a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C for treatment.
