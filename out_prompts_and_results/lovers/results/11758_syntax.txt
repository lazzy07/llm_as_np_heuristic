To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves from the dining room to the living room. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **tell(C2, C3, I1, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the flowers. This is a strategic move to influence Casey's actions, as Blake wants Alex to be happy.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room to the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to pick up the flowers, which are in the dining room.

4. **pick_up(C3, I1, R22)**: Casey picks up the flowers from the dining room. This is essential for Casey to have the item that Alex wants.

5. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the flowers. This is necessary to give the flowers to Alex.

6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire, making them happy.
