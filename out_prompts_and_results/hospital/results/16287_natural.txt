**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing the urgency of the situation, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, as they are not yet assigned to any exam room.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones.**  
   - By assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Ross will allow Dr. Hathaway to determine his condition and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.**  
   - After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway can assign him to the exam room where he will receive treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.**  
   - After assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can assign him to the exam room for treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - Based on the assessment, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with the correct medication, ensuring he becomes healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Likewise, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with the appropriate medication, ensuring he also becomes healthy.

8. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for the outcome but allows Dr. Hathaway to return to the starting point after completing the treatments.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (walking to admissions and assessing patients) are crucial for identifying the conditions of Jones and Ross, which is necessary for effective treatment.
- The next two actions (admitting patients to exam rooms) are required to ensure that both patients are in the correct locations for treatment.
- The treatment actions are essential for achieving the goal of making the patients healthy.
- The final walk back to Patient Room A is more of a procedural action, as Dr. Hathaway has completed the necessary steps to ensure the health of the patients.
