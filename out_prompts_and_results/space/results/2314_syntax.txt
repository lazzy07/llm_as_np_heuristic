To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe decides to leave the cave and walk to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to interact with the Lizard and potentially resolve their relationship.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, sensing Zoe's presence, walks back to the cave. This action is included to create a scenario where both characters are in the same location, allowing for further interaction.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard, now both on the surface, decide to make peace. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is included to set the stage for the eruption, which is a key event in the story.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to a dangerous situation on the surface. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying.

6. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, now in a dangerous situation due to the eruption, is killed by the volcanic activity. This action ensures that one character dies, fulfilling the story's requirements.

In summary, the actions taken lead to Zoe and the Lizard becoming friends just before the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death. This sequence of events aligns with the characters' goals and the story's requirements.
