To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters' actions lead to a resolution that includes the volcano erupting, a character dying, and the two characters making friends. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is taken to avoid the danger of the erupting volcano, as Zoe is currently unsafe on the surface. However, this action makes the Lizard angry, which is important for the story's conflict.

2. **The Lizard walks to the cave.** The Lizard, feeling angry and abandoned, seeks refuge in the cave, which is a safer location away from the volcano.

3. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** Zoe returns to the surface, despite the danger, to try and make amends with the Lizard. This action shows her determination to build a friendship.

4. **The volcano erupts.** This event is triggered as a consequence of the ongoing tension and the actions taken by both characters. The eruption creates a sense of urgency and danger.

5. **The Lizard is killed by the eruption.** The Lizard, being on the surface when the volcano erupts, cannot escape in time, leading to its demise.

6. **Zoe, witnessing the Lizard's death, feels remorse and realizes the importance of friendship.** This moment of reflection leads Zoe to understand that she should have prioritized making friends over her own safety.

7. **Zoe makes peace with the memory of the Lizard.** Although the Lizard is dead, Zoe vows to honor its memory by being a friend to other creatures in the universe, thus symbolically making peace.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, the death of the Lizard, and Zoe's realization about friendship, fulfilling the story's requirements.
