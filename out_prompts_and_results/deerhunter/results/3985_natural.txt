To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which fulfills his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Going to the bank**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **Stealing the money**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money, which is the primary objective of the story.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money while confirming that Bambi is dead, thus achieving the story's requirements.
