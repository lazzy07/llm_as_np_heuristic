To ensure Ross achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. If Ross has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.

3. **Walk Young to PatientRoomB**: Young will walk from Admissions to PatientRoomB to be assessed by Hathaway. This is necessary to ensure that Young is also evaluated and treated if needed.

4. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure Young's health is also addressed.

5. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that both patients are taken care of.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms.
2. **Treat(Ross)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment.
3. **Walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)**: Young walks to PatientRoomB to be assessed.
4. **Assess(Young)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms.
5. **Treat(Young)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment.

This sequence of actions ensures that both Ross and Young are assessed and treated appropriately, leading to their health and survival.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment(Ross), PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Young, Admissions, PatientRoomB)",
    "assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment(Young), PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Ross achieves his goal of being alive and healthy, while also addressing Young's health.
