To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the merchant.** The bandit is armed and the merchant is not, allowing the bandit to take the hero's coin from the merchant. This action directly contributes to the bandit's goal of acquiring coins.

2. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** After robbing the merchant, the bandit will return to the bandit camp, where she can store the coins in the chest. This action ensures that the coins are secured in the bandit camp, fulfilling the bandit's goal.

The story is concise and focuses solely on the actions necessary for the bandit to achieve her goal without any unnecessary events.
