To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage or acquiring wealth. Given the current situation, Talia has two marriage proposals from Rory and Vince, and she is in the cave where the treasure is located. 

The most straightforward way to ensure Talia's happiness is for her to accept one of the marriage proposals. Since both Rory and Vince have proposed to her, she can accept one of them. This will make her happy, fulfilling her desire.

Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes Talia happy, as she has accepted a proposal, and Rory is also happy because his proposal was accepted.

This single action is sufficient to ensure Talia's happiness, as it fulfills her desire for happiness through marriage.

### Explanation of the Action:
