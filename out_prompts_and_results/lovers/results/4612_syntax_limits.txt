To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Trade**: Alex (C1) can trade the item they have (which is I3, the flowers) with Casey (C3) for the item they want (I1, the jewelry). This action will make Alex happy because they will then possess the jewelry.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to give the flowers (I3) to Casey in exchange for the jewelry (I1). After this trade, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Alex is happy, as they will have the item they desire.
