In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are gathered. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey is happy with the jewelry. Since Alex is not happy and wants the flowers, Blake decides to help Alex by picking up the flowers from the living room and giving them to Alex. This action does not help Blake achieve their goal directly, but it creates a situation where Blake can then focus on getting the chocolates.

Blake picks up the flowers and gives them to Alex. Now, Alex is happy because they have the flowers. However, Blake still wants the chocolates. Since Casey believes the chocolates are in the bathroom, Blake can now move to the bathroom to find the chocolates.

Blake moves to the bathroom to search for the chocolates. 

Now, Blake is in the bathroom, and since the story only requires one action to achieve Blake's goal, we can conclude here.
