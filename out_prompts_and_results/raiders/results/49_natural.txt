**Story Completion:**

The Nazis, believing they have the upper hand, decide to take decisive action to achieve their goal of immortality. 

1. The Nazis travel from Tanis to the USA. (They need to be in the same location as the Ark to open it.)
2. The Nazis open the Ark of the Covenant. (Since the Ark is safe, this action will grant them immortality.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Travel from Tanis to the USA:** This action is necessary because the Nazis need to be in the same location as the Ark to open it. They cannot achieve their goal of immortality without being physically present with the Ark.
  
2. **Open the Ark of the Covenant:** This action is crucial as it directly leads to the Nazis achieving their goal of immortality. Since the Ark is safe, opening it will not result in their deaths but will instead grant them the immortality they seek.
