**Story Completion:**

After the events that transpired, Ernest finds himself in a precarious situation in the gym with the bully. Knowing that the bully is a threat to both him and Roy, he decides to take action. 

1. **kill(Ernest, Bully, Gym)**: Ernest, feeling cornered and threatened, realizes that the only way to ensure his survival and protect his friend Roy is to confront the bully. He takes the knife from the kitchen and uses it to kill the bully in the gym. This action is crucial as it eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Roy, allowing them to breathe a little easier in the prison environment.

2. **next_day()**: With the bully dead, the next day begins. This signifies a shift in the story, as the immediate danger has been dealt with, but the consequences of Ernest's actions will unfold.

3. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: On the new day, Ernest takes advantage of the chaos that follows the bully's death. He quickly makes his way to the hallway, crawls through the vents, and reaches the highway. There, he puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself to escape from the prison. This action fulfills his desire to be alive and free from threats.
