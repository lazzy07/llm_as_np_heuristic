Zoe and the Lizard are at the cave, both aware of the danger posed by the erupting surface. To achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends, they need to communicate and find common ground. 

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and healthy. By making peace, they can work together rather than against each other.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard leave the cave together.** This action signifies their new alliance and their decision to face the dangers of the planet together, ensuring their safety and health.

In this story, the actions taken lead to a positive outcome where both characters become friends, and the eruption serves as a reminder of the dangers they face, reinforcing their bond.
