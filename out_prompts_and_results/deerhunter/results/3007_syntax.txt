To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, and the bank clerk is also present. Bubba is greedy and wants money, while the clerk has one unit of money. Bubba is also hungry, but his primary goal is to get the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money without needing to shoot the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to get to a safe location where he can keep the money.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry, and it allows him to satisfy that need.

The final story is as follows:

1. Bubba, feeling greedy and wanting money, decides to steal from the bank clerk using his loaded rifle.
2. After successfully stealing the money, he leaves the bank and heads back to his house.
3. Once at home, he decides to eat to satisfy his hunger.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.
