**Story Completion:**

After locking the gym door, Roy knows he has a chance to confront the bully without any immediate threats. He takes a deep breath, grips the knife tightly, and decides to take revenge on the bully. 

In a swift motion, Roy lunges at the bully, catching him off guard. The bully, who was focused on his workout, doesn't have time to react. Roy stabs the bully, ensuring that he can no longer threaten him or Ernest. With the bully incapacitated, Roy feels a rush of relief. 

Now that the threat is gone, Roy can focus on escaping. He quickly changes into the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. With the gym door locked and the bully out of the picture, Roy makes his way to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, he crawls through the vents and emerges outside on the highway. With the disguise on, he confidently walks away from the prison, finally free.
