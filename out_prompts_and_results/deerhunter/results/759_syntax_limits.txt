After eating Bambi in the forest, Bubba feels a surge of greed for money. He decides to go to the bank to steal from the bank clerk, who has some money. 

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba moves from the forest to the bank, where he believes he can find money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steals the money.

These actions are necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where the money is, and the second action directly fulfills his greedy desire by acquiring the money from the clerk.
