**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Dr. Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy as a result of the treatment.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C. After admitting Jones, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is still experiencing unknown symptoms. However, since Dr. Hathaway's workload is now at 2, they can accurately assess Jones without making a mistake. 

Dr. Hathaway discovers that Jones has a rash, indicating they have Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Jones becomes healthy as a result of the treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway returns to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. With a workload of 2, Dr. Hathaway can accurately assess Ross.
