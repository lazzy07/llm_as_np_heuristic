Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the imminent danger posed by the erupting volcano. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have just become friends, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the eruption and remain healthy.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** The Lizard needs to find a safe place away from the erupting surface. The cave is a safer location where the Lizard can stay healthy and avoid the dangers of the eruption.

3. **The volcano erupts.** This event is included to illustrate the danger that both characters were trying to avoid. Since Zoe has teleported to safety and the Lizard has moved to the cave, they both successfully avoid harm.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe. Zoe is safe in her spaceship, and the Lizard is safe in the cave, away from the eruption.
