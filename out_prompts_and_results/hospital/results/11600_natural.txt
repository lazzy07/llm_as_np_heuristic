**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross from Admissions to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Like Jones, Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young from Admissions to Patient Room A. This keeps Hathaway's workload at 3, but it is essential to ensure all patients are accounted for.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Young is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

At this point, Dr. Hathaway realizes that all patients are in different rooms and experiencing Unknown symptoms. To ensure all patients are treated, Dr. Hathaway decides to treat all three patients with antibiotics, as it is the only treatment available. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room C with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Jones becomes healthy. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with antibiotics, which is incorrect since Ross has Unknown symptoms. Ross dies.

Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room A with antibiotics, which is also incorrect since Young has Unknown symptoms. Young dies.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Ross and Young, Dr. Hathaway successfully treated Jones, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
