Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, feeling the ground tremble beneath her feet as the volcano begins to erupt. She knows she needs to act quickly to ensure her safety and to foster a friendship with the Lizard. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends her hand in friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it solidifies their relationship and ensures they are no longer enemies, allowing them to collaborate rather than fight.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to protect both characters from the imminent danger of the eruption.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring both characters are safe from the eruption. This action completes their journey to safety and reinforces their newfound friendship.

With these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
