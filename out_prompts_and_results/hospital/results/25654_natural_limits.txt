Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Ross, who is currently in Patient Room A and exhibiting symptoms of Fever. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is only 1, there is no risk of making a mistake in diagnosing Ross's condition. 

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze, as he has a fever. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.
2. After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases by one, allowing him to focus on the next patient.
3. Dr. Hathaway then admits Young from Admissions to Patient Room B, as Young is still unassigned and needs to be seen.
4. Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B, but since Young's symptoms are unknown, he cannot treat him yet. However, this action is necessary to ensure that Young is also on the path to health.
