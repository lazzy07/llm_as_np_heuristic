To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba, wanting the money, will decide to steal from the clerk since he has a loaded rifle.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can successfully steal the money from the clerk.
3. **Bubba decides to eat**: After stealing the money, Bubba is still hungry, so he decides to eat.
4. **Bubba goes to the forest**: Bubba goes to the forest where Bambi is located.
5. **Bubba shoots Bambi**: With the rifle still loaded, Bubba can shoot Bambi, resulting in her death.

This sequence ensures that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
