To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax is in the cave where the treasure is located. By picking up the treasure, Gargax will increase their wealth, which is one of their goals.

2. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: Gargax is still hungry after picking up the treasure. To satisfy their hunger, Gargax will eat Talia, who is also in the cave. This action will ensure Gargax is no longer hungry.

These two actions will allow Gargax to achieve their goals of being wealthy (by acquiring the treasure) and not hungry (by eating Talia).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to become wealthy, as the treasure is the only item that can increase their wealth.
- **eat(Gargax, Talia, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Gargax is currently hungry and needs to eat to fulfill that requirement.
