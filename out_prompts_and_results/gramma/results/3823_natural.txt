**Story Completion:**

1. The merchant, who is at the bandit camp, decides to walk to the crossroads. This action is necessary for the merchant to get closer to the market where she can sell her items and potentially earn more coins.

2. Upon reaching the crossroads, the merchant sees the guard at the market and decides to report the location of the bandit. This action is crucial because it helps the merchant avoid any potential danger from the bandit while also gaining favor with the guard, who is looking to eliminate criminals.

3. The guard, upon receiving the information from the merchant, walks from the market to the bandit camp to confront the bandit. This action is necessary for the guard to fulfill his goal of killing criminals.

4. The guard arrives at the bandit camp and attacks the bandit, who is unarmed. This action is essential as it directly leads to the bandit's defeat, allowing the merchant to feel safe and secure in her dealings.

5. After the bandit is defeated, the guard loots the bandit's chest and finds the bandit's coins. This action is important because it removes the threat of the bandit and allows the guard to take the coins, which could be beneficial for the merchant as well.

6. The merchant, now feeling safe, walks from the crossroads back to the market. This action is necessary for her to resume her business and sell her items.

7. Finally, the merchant sells the medicine she was carrying to a customer at the market, earning her the coins she desires. This action fulfills the merchant's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal.
