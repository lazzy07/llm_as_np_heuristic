To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, we also need to ensure that Bubba can secure the money.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal from the clerk, which will allow him to take the money.
3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Bubba is already greedy and wants money, so this action is implicit in his decision to steal.
4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba can return to the forest.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to return to the bank where the money is located.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling the goal of Bubba having the money.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: This action reinforces Bubba's motivation to acquire money, although it is already established that he is greedy.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action allows Bubba to return to the forest after successfully stealing the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
