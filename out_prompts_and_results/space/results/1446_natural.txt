Zoe, realizing that the surface is dangerous and wanting to make friends with the Lizard, decides to take action. She teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet, where she hopes to find the Lizard. 

Upon arriving on the surface, Zoe sees the Lizard and approaches him. Instead of attacking or teleporting back, she chooses to make peace. This action is crucial because it allows her to establish a friendly relationship with the Lizard, which is one of her goals. 

The Lizard, surprised by Zoe's peaceful approach, decides to reciprocate. They both express their desire to be healthy and safe and to make friends with each other. This mutual understanding leads to a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard.

With their newfound friendship, Zoe and the Lizard agree to work together to ensure their safety on the planet, especially with the threat of the volcano. They decide to explore the cave together, where they can be safe from the dangers of the surface.

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Zoe teleports to the surface to find the Lizard.
2. Zoe makes peace with the Lizard to establish a friendship.

These actions are necessary to achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
