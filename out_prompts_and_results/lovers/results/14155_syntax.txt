To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) has the jewelry, and both Alex (C1) and Blake (C2) are unhappy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Alex's goal:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) to Blake (C2) in exchange for the chocolates (I3). This action is necessary because it allows Casey to get the item they want (chocolates) while giving Alex the opportunity to get the jewelry.

2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the same room (R22). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R22)**: This action allows Casey to obtain the chocolates they want while giving Blake the jewelry that Alex desires. It sets up the next action where Alex can receive the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action transfers the jewelry from Blake to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
