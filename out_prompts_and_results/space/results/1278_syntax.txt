To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already in a non-fighting state and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures that they are not enemies.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will walk back to the cave, which is a safer location compared to the surface, where the volcano could erupt. This action helps the Lizard to ensure its safety.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will follow the Lizard to the cave. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are in a safe location together.

4. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface will begin to erupt. This action is included to demonstrate the danger of the surface and the importance of being in the cave.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are safely in the cave, they are not harmed. This action emphasizes the need for safety and the success of the Lizard's goal.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
