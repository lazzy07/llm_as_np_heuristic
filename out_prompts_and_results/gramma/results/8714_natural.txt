To ensure the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the merchant to return to a location where she can interact with other characters, particularly the guard and the hero.

2. **Merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard.**  
   - By reporting the bandit, the merchant can gain favor with the guard, who is looking to eliminate criminals. This action also helps the merchant avoid any suspicion of wrongdoing.

3. **Guard walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - The guard moves to the crossroads to confront the bandit based on the merchant's report, which is essential for the merchant to ensure her safety and maintain her non-criminal status.

4. **Guard attacks and kills the bandit.**  
   - This action eliminates the threat posed by the bandit, allowing the merchant to operate freely without fear of robbery or violence.

5. **Merchant loots an item from the corpse of the dead bandit.**  
   - The merchant can now take the bandit's sword, which is an item of value, and potentially any coins the bandit may have had, thus increasing her wealth without committing a crime.

6. **Merchant walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - The merchant moves to the market to sell the sword and any other items she has acquired, maximizing her coin collection.

7. **Merchant sells the sword to the guard for a coin.**  
   - This action allows the merchant to gain a coin legally, contributing to her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.

By following this sequence of actions, the merchant successfully increases her wealth while adhering to her moral code.
