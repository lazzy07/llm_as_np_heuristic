**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Ernest finds himself in the hallway. He knows that the bully is in the gym, and he feels threatened. To ensure his safety and to escape the prison, he decides to take a bold step. 

Ernest locks the gym door, trapping the bully inside. This action prevents the bully from coming after him and gives him a chance to escape without being threatened. 

With the gym door locked, Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Now disguised, he makes his way to the highway. 

Once on the highway, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.
