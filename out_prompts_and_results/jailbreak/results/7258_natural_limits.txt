**Story Completion:**

Ernest, aware of the bully's threats, decides to take a risk. He sneaks into the kitchen through the hallway, where he knows the knife is located. He quickly grabs the knife, feeling a surge of determination. With the knife in hand, he heads back to the gym, where the bully is still occupied with his workout. 

Once inside the gym, Ernest locks the door behind him, ensuring that no one can interrupt. The bully, surprised to see Ernest, turns to confront him. In a moment of desperation and self-preservation, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully, finally freeing himself and Roy from the constant threat.

With the bully dead, Ernest takes a moment to catch his breath. He then puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, disguising himself. Now, he feels a sense of hope as he makes his way back to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, he steps outside onto the highway, where he can finally escape from the prison.
