To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the story will focus on her actions in the cave, where she can access the treasure. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Talia picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as the treasure is located in the cave.

2. **Talia travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Talia needs to return to the village to be with Rory and Vince, who are both there, and to share her newfound wealth.

3. **Talia proposes marriage to Rory.**  
   - Since Talia is already married to both Rory and Vince, this action is redundant but serves to reinforce her commitment to Rory, which may increase her happiness.

4. **Rory accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This action ensures that Talia and Rory are happy together, contributing to Talia's happiness.

5. **Talia and Rory get married.**  
   - This formalizes their relationship and solidifies Talia's happiness.

6. **Talia proposes marriage to Vince.**  
   - Similar to the previous proposal, this action reinforces her commitment to Vince, which may also increase her happiness.

7. **Vince accepts Talia's proposal.**  
   - This ensures that Talia and Vince are happy together, contributing further to Talia's happiness.
