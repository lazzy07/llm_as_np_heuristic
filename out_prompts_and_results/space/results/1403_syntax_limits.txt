In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. They have already made peace, which means they are not fighting and can work towards their goals of friendship. However, the volcano on the surface is a looming threat.

To ensure the story ends with the volcano erupting and a character dying, we can have Zoe take an action that leads to this outcome. Since Zoe is currently on the surface and the volcano has already begun to erupt, we can have her stay on the surface, which will ultimately lead to her demise.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Zoe stays on the surface**: Since the volcano has begun to erupt, Zoe will not take any action to teleport back to the ship or walk to safety. This will lead to her being caught in the eruption.

2. **The volcano erupts**: This action will result in Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.

The story is short and direct, focusing on the consequences of the environment and the choices made by Zoe.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Zoe remains on the surface**: This is implied as she does not take any action to leave, leading to her eventual demise.
- **Erupt**: This action is necessary to conclude the story with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death.
