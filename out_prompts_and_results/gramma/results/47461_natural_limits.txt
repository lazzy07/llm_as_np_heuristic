The bandit, armed with her sword, sees the guard at the market. Knowing that the guard is a threat to her freedom, she decides to attack him. The guard, unarmed against the banditâ€™s sword, is unable to defend himself and is killed. With the guard out of the way, the bandit now has the opportunity to loot the merchant, who is also dead and has the medicine and the hero's coin. The bandit takes both items, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can and having the medicine.
