In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the jewelry (I3) they received from Alex. Blake (C2) wants the chocolates (I2) but is currently unhappy. 

To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, the simplest action would be for Alex to pick up the flowers (I1) that are in the same room (R22) where they currently are. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making them happy.

Here’s the action taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room (R22). This action makes Alex happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake remains unhappy because they still do not have the chocolates.
- Casey remains happy with the jewelry.

This action is sufficient for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
