To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax is currently in the Village and needs to travel to the Cave to obtain the treasure. This action is necessary for Gargax to reach the location where the treasure is located.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: After traveling to the Cave, Gargax will pick up the treasure. This action is essential for Gargax to become wealthy, as the treasure is the item that will fulfill this goal.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax is not currently hungry, but to fulfill the condition of not being hungry after obtaining wealth, we will simulate that Gargax becomes hungry. This action is included to show the transition to a state where Gargax can then eat.

4. **eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)**: Gargax will then travel back to the Village and eat Talia. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Gargax needs to ensure they are not hungry after acquiring wealth.

The sequence of actions ensures that Gargax first travels to the Cave to pick up the treasure, then becomes hungry, and finally eats Talia to satisfy that hunger. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)",
    "get_hungry(Gargax)",
    "eat(Gargax, Talia, Village)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads Gargax to achieve their goals of being wealthy and not hungry.
