**Story Completion:**

The bandit, having successfully robbed the hero's coin, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the guard is at the market and the merchant is also there, leaving the crossroads relatively unguarded. 

1. The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp. (This action allows the bandit to return to her camp where she can secure her stolen coin.)
2. The bandit places the hero's coin into the chest at the bandit camp. (This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at her camp.)

With these two actions, the bandit successfully achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of walking to the bandit camp is necessary for the bandit to secure her stolen coin and return to her preferred location.
- The second action of placing the coin in the chest is essential for achieving her goal of having coins stored safely.
