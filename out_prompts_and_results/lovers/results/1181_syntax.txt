To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Given the current situation, here’s a concise story that leads to that outcome:

1. **Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the jewelry (I3) in the dining room (R21)**. This action is strategic because it creates a belief in Blake that Alex wants the jewelry, which can lead to a trade or a transfer of items.
   
2. **Blake picks up the jewelry (I3) from the dining room (R21)**. This action is necessary because Blake needs to have the jewelry in order to give it to Casey.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room (R21) to the living room (R12)**. This movement is required to bring the jewelry closer to Casey, who is currently in the same room.

4. **Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey in the living room (R12)**. This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

5. **Casey is now happy because they have the jewelry (I3)**. This is the desired outcome of the story.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **Tell**: This action is used to manipulate the beliefs of another character, which can lead to a favorable outcome for Casey.
- **Pick up**: Blake needs to physically have the jewelry to give it to Casey.
- **Move**: This action is necessary to change locations and facilitate the transfer of the jewelry.
- **Give**: This is the final action that directly results in Casey achieving their goal of happiness.
