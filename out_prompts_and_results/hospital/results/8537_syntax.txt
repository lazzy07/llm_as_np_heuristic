To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Young has in order to treat them correctly.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Young.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.
