To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is hungry and has a loaded rifle, decides to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bambi being dead, fulfilling one of the conditions of the ending.
