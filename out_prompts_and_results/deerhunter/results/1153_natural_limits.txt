Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting to have money, decides to take action. He looks at the bank clerk, who has 1 money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can use it to achieve his goal. 

Bubba points the rifle at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, realizing the danger, hands over the 1 money to Bubba. Now, Bubba has what he wanted.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is necessary for Bubba to take the clerk's money, as he is hungry and wants to have money. However, since the goal is to keep the story short, we can assume that Bubba simply intimidates the clerk into handing over the money instead of shooting him, which would lead to a longer story.

The final story is:
