In this story, Zoe is currently on her spaceship, while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the situation dangerous. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and a character die, we can have Zoe teleport back to the surface, where the eruption will ultimately lead to a character's demise.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary to place her in a dangerous situation where the volcano is erupting.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which is a natural consequence of the previous actions and leads to the death of Zoe, as she is now on the surface during the eruption.

This sequence of actions fulfills the requirement of having the volcano erupt and a character die, while also keeping the story concise.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: This action is essential to move Zoe from the safety of her spaceship to the dangerous surface where the volcano is active.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action represents the climax of the story, resulting in Zoe's death due to the eruption, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
