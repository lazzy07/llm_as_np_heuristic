To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to this outcome:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is in the bedroom (R12) and has given away the jewelry (I3).
- Casey is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).
- Blake remains unhappy, but the focus is on Casey achieving their goal.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Casey to be able to interact with Alex, who has the item Casey wants.
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R12)**: This action is the key to making Casey happy, as it provides them with the jewelry they desire.
