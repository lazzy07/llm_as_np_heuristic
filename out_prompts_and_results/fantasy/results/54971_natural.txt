To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is already married to Rory and Vince, which means she has the potential to become happy through her relationships. However, she also needs to acquire wealth to fulfill her goal of being wealthy.

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Rory gives Talia the treasure.** This action is necessary because Talia currently has no wealth, and by receiving the treasure from Rory, she can become wealthy. Rory is motivated to help Talia because they are married, and this will also contribute to Talia's happiness.

2. **Talia becomes happy.** This action is implicit after Talia receives the treasure, as she is now wealthy and has the support of her husbands.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Rory gives Talia the treasure. (This action helps Talia become wealthy.)
2. Talia becomes happy. (This action is a result of Talia receiving the treasure.)

With these actions, Talia achieves her goals of becoming both happy and wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Rory gives Talia the treasure:** This is a crucial action because it directly addresses Talia's goal of becoming wealthy. Since Rory has the treasure and is married to Talia, he is inclined to share it with her.
- **Talia becomes happy:** This is a logical conclusion after Talia receives the treasure, as wealth typically contributes to happiness, especially in the context of her desires.
