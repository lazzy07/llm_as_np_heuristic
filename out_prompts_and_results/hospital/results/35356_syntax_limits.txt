**Story Completion:**

After Young walks back to the admissions room, Hathaway decides to admit Jones to exam room B, as he is still in the admissions room and needs to be assessed. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 2, but it is still manageable. 

Next, Hathaway assesses Jones in exam room B. Since Jones has SymptomA, Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Jarkis. 

Hathaway then treats Jones with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which makes Jones healthy. 

Finally, Hathaway assesses Young again in exam room A to confirm that Young has SymptomB, which indicates he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy as well.
