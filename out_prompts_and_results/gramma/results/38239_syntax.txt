To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This is possible because Tom is not armed with a sword, making him vulnerable to robbery. The Bandit will gain a coin, which contributes to her goal of accumulating coins.

2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action allows her to secure her stolen coin in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit successfully robs Tom, taking his coin. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count, moving her closer to her goal.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her newly acquired coin in the chest. This action is necessary to ensure that the coin is secured and contributes to her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit now has achieved her goal of either carrying coins or having them in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
