To achieve the goal of having Bubba end up with the money or ensuring Bambi is dead (or both), we can take the following action:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and has already shot Bambi. He is hungry and has decided to get money. The next logical step is for him to go to the bank where the clerk is located, as he believes the clerk has money.

This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to confront the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Bubba will be at the bank, where he can take further actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Since the goal is to keep the story short and only include necessary actions, this single action is sufficient to set up the next potential actions for Bubba to acquire the money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)"]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads Bubba closer to his goal of obtaining money while ensuring Bambi remains dead, as he has already shot her.
