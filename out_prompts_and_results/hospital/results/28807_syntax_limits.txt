In this story, we want to ensure that Jones, a hospital patient, achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we need to take actions that will allow Hathaway to assess and treat Jones effectively.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room B to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment. 

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If Jones has Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

- **Action 1**: `assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)`. This action is taken to identify what disease Jones has, which is essential for providing the correct treatment.
  
- **Action 2**: `treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)`. This action is taken to treat Jones based on the assessment. If the treatment is correct, Jones will become healthy.

By performing these two actions, Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
