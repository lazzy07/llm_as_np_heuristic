Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to admit both Jones and Young to exam rooms for assessment. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.**  
   - This action is necessary to ensure that Jones receives the attention he needs. By admitting him, Dr. Hathaway can assess his symptoms.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - Similar to Jones, Young needs to be assessed for his symptoms. Admitting him allows Dr. Hathaway to provide the necessary care.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Since Ross is already in Patient Room B, Dr. Hathaway can assess him to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for deciding the correct treatment.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Ross has a fever (the symptom of Flaze), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats the patients, achieving the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
