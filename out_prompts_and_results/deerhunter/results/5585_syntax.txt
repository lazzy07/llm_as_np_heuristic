To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means he can eat her to satisfy his hunger. After that, he can return to the bank to steal more money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba will eat Bambi, which satisfies his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and possibly clear his mind for further actions.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary for him to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal more money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the clerk again. Since he has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him money. This action is crucial for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining more money.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will decide to get money, solidifying his intention to take the money from the clerk. This action is implicit in the previous steal action but reinforces his greedy nature.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba back to the bank to confront the clerk.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Allows Bubba to take money from the clerk using intimidation.
4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Confirms Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
