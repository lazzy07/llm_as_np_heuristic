Ernest is in the hallway, feeling threatened by the bully who owns a pack of cigarettes. He knows that he needs to secure his safety and get the cigarettes to feel more at ease. Since the gym is locked, he decides to take a bold step. 

Ernest uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to kill the bully in the gym. This action eliminates the threat the bully poses to both him and Roy, allowing him to feel safe. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now take the pack of cigarettes from Roy without fear of retaliation.

After killing the bully, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison. He puts on the civilian clothes he stole from the laundry, disguising himself. He then makes his way to the highway, where he successfully escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **kill(Bully, Ernest, Gym)**: This action is necessary for Ernest to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring his safety and allowing him to take the cigarettes without fear.
2. **disguise(Ernest, Clothes, Hall)**: After killing the bully, Ernest disguises himself to avoid detection by the guards.
3. **escape(Ernest, Highway)**: Finally, Ernest escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
