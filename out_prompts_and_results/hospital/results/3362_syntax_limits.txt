**Story Completion:**

After admitting Jones to Exam Room A, Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A. Since Jones has a fever, Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Flaze.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- The first action, assessing Jones, is necessary for Hathaway to identify the disease Jones has. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.
- The second action, treating Jones with antibiotics, is essential for Jones to achieve his goal of being alive and healthy. Since the treatment matches the disease, Jones successfully recovers.
