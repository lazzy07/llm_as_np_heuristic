Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to take immediate action. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess and treat them. Young is currently in Patient Room B, and admitting them to Patient Room C increases Hathaway's workload to 2, which is still manageable.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C.** This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway will need to assess them to decide on the appropriate treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room A with antibiotics.** Since Ross is exhibiting a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze, treating him with antibiotics is the correct action. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

After these actions, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has successfully achieved their goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
