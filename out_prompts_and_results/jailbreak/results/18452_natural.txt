**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Roy is still in the cells and that the bully is also there, posing a threat to both of them. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for him to access the gym and potentially help Roy.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot follow him or threaten him while he plans his next move.)
3. **Ernest sneaks through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows him to confront the bully without being seen.)
4. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for him to defend himself and eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)
5. **Ernest confronts the bully in the gym.** (This action is necessary to deal with the bully directly.)
6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action removes the immediate threat to both himself and Roy.)
7. **Ernest then goes back to the hallway.** (This action allows him to regroup and plan his escape.)
8. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (He is already wearing them, but this action reinforces his disguise.)
9. **Ernest escapes through the highway.** (This final action allows him to achieve his goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure Ernest's survival and to eliminate the threat posed by the bully. By locking the gym door, he secures a safe space to confront the bully. Retrieving the knife is crucial for self-defense. Killing the bully is the only way to ensure that both he and Roy are no longer threatened. Finally, escaping through the highway allows him to achieve his ultimate goal of being alive and free.
