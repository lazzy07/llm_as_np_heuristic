To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R11) to access the flowers, which are currently in the living room (C3).
2. **move(C1, R11, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) where the flowers are located.
3. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the living room.
4. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12) to be with Casey.
5. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey, ensuring that both Alex and Casey are happy.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **move(C1, R12, R11)**: This action is necessary for Alex to get closer to the living room where the flowers are located.
- **move(C1, R11, R22)**: This action allows Alex to enter the living room where the flowers are.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the flowers, which is the item they want to be happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex returns to the dining room to be with Casey, which is important for their relationship and to ensure Casey's happiness.
- **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: This final action ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by giving the flowers to Casey, who also wants to be happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, and Casey will also be happy because they received the flowers.
