**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is in Patient Room A with Jones. Since Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms, the first action is to assess Jones.

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to identify his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway believes Jones is alive and healthy.

After assessing Jones, Hathaway realizes that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address Young, who is in Patient Room C. Since Young is also a patient, Hathaway will assess him next.

3. **walk(Hathaway, from PatientRoomA, to PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway walks to Patient Room C to assess Young.

4. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Young and finds that he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis, making Young healthy as well.

With both Jones and Young treated successfully, Hathaway has achieved their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
