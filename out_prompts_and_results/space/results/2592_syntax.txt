To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing for Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, will walk back to the surface from the cave. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard back to the surface where the volcano is located.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt. This action is crucial as it sets the stage for the impending danger on the surface.

3. **walk(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe will walk from the spaceship to the surface. This action is necessary for her to be present on the surface when the volcano erupts.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which will lead to the death of one character. Since Zoe is on the surface, she will be affected by the eruption.

5. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Before the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard can make peace. This action is important as it allows them to become friends despite the dangerous situation.

In this sequence, the volcano erupts after Zoe has made peace with the Lizard, leading to their friendship, but unfortunately, Zoe dies in the eruption. This fulfills the requirement of having a character die while also ensuring that the two characters become friends.
