To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Vince, as she has already accepted his proposal. The next logical step is for them to get married, which will make Talia happy. After that, Talia can take the money from Vince, which will make her wealthy. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia and Vince get married, which fulfills Talia's desire for happiness.
2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: Talia takes the money from Vince, which fulfills her desire to be wealthy.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: This action is crucial because Talia has accepted Vince's proposal, and getting married will make her happy, which is one of her primary goals.
- **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Village)**: This action allows Talia to acquire the money that Vince has, thus fulfilling her goal of becoming wealthy.

With these two actions, Talia achieves both of her goals.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:
