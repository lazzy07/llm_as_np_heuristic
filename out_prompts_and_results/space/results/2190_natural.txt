Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the spaceship for safety. However, this action angers the Lizard, who perceives Zoe's teleportation as a threat to the planet. The Lizard, feeling protective, decides to confront Zoe at the surface.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to ensure her safety from the erupting surface.
2. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard is responding to Zoe's teleportation, feeling the need to confront her about her actions.
3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the surface.** - Zoe returns to the surface, believing she can still make peace with the Lizard despite the danger.
4. **The Lizard and Zoe begin to fight.** - The Lizard, feeling threatened by Zoe's actions, initiates a fight to protect the planet.
5. **Zoe stuns the Lizard.** - Zoe, wanting to avoid a deadly confrontation, stuns the Lizard to prevent further escalation.
6. **The volcano erupts.** - The eruption occurs while Zoe is still on the surface, creating a dire situation.
7. **The Lizard breaks free from being stunned.** - The Lizard regains consciousness just as the eruption begins.
8. **The Lizard and Zoe make peace.** - Realizing the imminent danger of the eruption, both characters decide to set aside their differences and work together for survival.

In this sequence, the actions lead to the eruption of the volcano, which ultimately results in the Lizard's demise. However, before the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard manage to make peace, fulfilling their goals of safety and friendship, albeit in a tragic context.
