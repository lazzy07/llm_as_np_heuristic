To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market to find Tom, who is carrying a coin. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to rob Tom to acquire coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of the coin he is carrying. This action is crucial for the Bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit returns to the Crossroads. This is necessary to position herself for the next action.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to store the coins she has acquired. This is essential for achieving her goal of having coins in the chest at the camp.

5. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit places the coin she stole from Tom into the chest at the Bandit Camp. This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal.
