Dr. Hathaway, still at Admissions, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is the only patient in that room, Hathaway's workload remains manageable at 2. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**
   - This action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. By assessing him, Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. 

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics.**
   - This action is crucial as it directly addresses Jones's condition. Since Jones has Flaze, the antibiotics will effectively treat him, ensuring he becomes healthy.

With Jones treated successfully, he achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Final Explanation:**
- The story includes only two actions: assessing Jones to identify his symptoms and treating him with the correct medication. This minimal approach ensures that Jones's goal is achieved efficiently without unnecessary complications.
