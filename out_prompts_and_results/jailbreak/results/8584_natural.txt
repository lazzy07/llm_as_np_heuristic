**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, feeling the weight of the bully's threats, decides to take action. He knows that the bully is in the gym with Roy, and he fears for both their lives. 

1. **Ernest moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to the gym where Roy and the bully are located.)
   
2. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows him to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, reducing the risk of being threatened or attacked.)

3. **Ernest locks the gym door behind him.** (By locking the door, he prevents the bully from escaping and isolates him with Roy, ensuring they can confront the bully together.)

4. **Ernest grabs the knife from Roy.** (This action is crucial as it gives them a means to defend themselves against the bully.)

5. **Ernest and Roy confront the bully.** (They need to face the bully together to overcome the threat he poses.)

6. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is the climax of the story, allowing them to eliminate the threat and ensure their survival.)

With the bully dead, Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened. They can now plan their escape. However, the story ends here with the resolution of the immediate threat.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Ernest is aimed at overcoming the bully's threats and ensuring both he and Roy survive. Moving to the hallway and crawling through the vents allows him to avoid direct confrontation initially. Locking the gym door is a strategic move to contain the bully, and acquiring the knife is essential for their defense. The final confrontation leads to the bully's demise, resolving the immediate danger.
