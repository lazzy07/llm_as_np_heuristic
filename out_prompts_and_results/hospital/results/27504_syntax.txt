To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross** in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms.
2. **Assess Young** in Admissions to determine his symptoms.
3. **Treat Ross** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.
4. **Treat Young** with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms.

### Explanation of Actions:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: This action is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis. Since he is currently assigned to Exam Room A, Hathaway can assess him there. This is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

2. **Assess(Young)**: Young is currently in Admissions, and Hathaway needs to assess him to find out his symptoms. This will help Hathaway decide on the right treatment for him as well.

3. **Treat(Ross)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat(Young)**: Similarly, after assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment based on his symptoms. This action is also crucial for Young's recovery.

By performing these actions, Hathaway will ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.
