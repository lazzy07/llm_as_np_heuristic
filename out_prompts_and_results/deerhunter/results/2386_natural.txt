To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located and where the money is.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, which directly fulfills his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba needs to return to the forest, which is his original location.
