Tom, at the crossroads, sees the bandit standing nearby. Knowing that he is unarmed and the bandit is a criminal, he decides to take a cautious approach. He quickly reports the bandit's location to the guard, who is still at the market. The guard, upon receiving the information, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit.

The guard arrives at the crossroads and, armed with his sword, attacks the bandit, who is unable to defend herself since she is not armed. The bandit falls, and the guard loots her sword and the coins from the chest, ensuring that the bandit can no longer pose a threat.

With the bandit defeated, Tom is now safe to return to the cottage carrying the medicine he purchased earlier. He walks back to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.
