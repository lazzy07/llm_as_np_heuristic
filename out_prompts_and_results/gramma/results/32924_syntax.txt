To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The Bandit will rob the Merchant to take the coins. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and the Merchant is unarmed and vulnerable.
2. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: After robbing the Merchant, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp to secure the coins in the chest. This is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the coins she has. This action is crucial as it directly increases the Bandit's coin count, moving her closer to her goal.
2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins secured in the chest.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by the end of these actions.
