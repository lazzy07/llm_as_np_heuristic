To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the bank with a loaded rifle and is greedy for money. The bank clerk is also present and has money. Bambi is in the forest and is not directly involved in the bank scenario but can be considered for Bubba's actions.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, being greedy and wanting money, will shoot the bank clerk to take the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can pick up the money from the bank. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, achieving one of the specified endings.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After the clerk is dead, Bubba can safely pick up the money, fulfilling his greed and achieving the goal of having money.
