To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is important for Alex to share their happiness with the others.

4. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Casey that they have the flowers. This action is included to communicate Alex's happiness and potentially influence Casey's feelings.

5. **tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)**: Alex tells Blake that they have the flowers. This is similar to the previous action, reinforcing Alex's happiness to Blake.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

    "tell(C1, C2, I1, R22)",
    "tell(C1, C3, I1, R22)"
  ]
}
```
