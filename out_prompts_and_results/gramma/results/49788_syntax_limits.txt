To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, he needs to leave the market and head back to the cottage. Since he is currently at the market with the medicine, he can simply walk back to the cottage.

Here’s the complete story with the necessary action:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the market to the cottage, successfully achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Tom's desire to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. No other actions are needed since he already possesses the medicine.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
