In the cave, Talia and Vince are married, but Talia is still unhappy despite her wealth. Gargax, the dragon, is hungry and desires wealth. To achieve her goal of happiness, Talia needs to find a way to make Gargax happy, as his wealth will not satisfy him without food. 

1. Gargax eats Vince. (This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy his hunger. By eating Vince, Gargax will also take the money that Vince has, which will make him wealthier. This action indirectly helps Talia because it will lead to a change in the dynamics of the cave, allowing Talia to take the treasure and potentially make a deal with Gargax.)

After Gargax eats Vince, he becomes wealthy and no longer hungry. Talia, now alone in the cave, can pick up the treasure that is there. 

2. Talia picks up the treasure. (This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, which is one of her goals.)

Now, Talia has the treasure and is wealthy. With her wealth, she feels a sense of accomplishment and happiness.

- Gargax eats Vince.
