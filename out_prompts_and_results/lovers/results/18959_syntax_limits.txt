In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the jewelry (I1) to be happy, and it is currently with Casey (C3). To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the jewelry from Casey. 

Here’s the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C3, I1, R12)**: Alex suggests a trade with Casey, offering the chocolates (I3) in exchange for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (jewelry) while giving Casey something in return, which may help Casey feel happy as well.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3) and may or may not be happy depending on their own desires, but Alex's goal is achieved.

Here’s the explanation of the action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Alex gets what they want (the jewelry) while also maintaining a fair exchange, which aligns with the characters' motivations to make each other happy.
