To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her acquiring the treasure and ensuring her happiness. Since Talia is already married to Rory, she is happy. The next step is for her to acquire wealth, which can be achieved by obtaining the treasure located in the cave.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia achieving her goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave (Talia)**: Talia needs to go to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for her to access the treasure.
   
2. **Pickup Treasure (Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Once Talia is in the cave, she can pick up the treasure. This action directly contributes to her goal of becoming wealthy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Travel(Talia, Village, Cave)**: Talia moves to the cave to access the treasure.
- **Pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: Talia collects the treasure, which increases her wealth.

After these actions, Talia will be wealthy and happy, achieving her goal.
