To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they may make a mistake if they assess Ross again. However, Young is in a different room, and assessing them will allow Hathaway to determine their symptoms accurately without the risk of confusion. 

2. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is found to have the rash symptom (indicating Jarkis), Hathaway can treat them with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway walks to PatientRoomC and assesses Young. This action is necessary to determine if Young has Jarkis (rash) or Flaze (fever). Since Young's symptom is unknown, this assessment is crucial for the next step.

2. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Young is diagnosed with Jarkis, Hathaway treats them with steroids. This action is essential to ensure that Young becomes healthy, fulfilling Hathaway's goal of making all patients healthy.

By following these two actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and achieve their goal.
