**Story Completion:**

1. **Admit(Hathaway, Jones, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room B, increasing their workload to 2. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

2. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom(Jones), PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room B. Since Jones is a new patient, Hathaway will discover his symptoms, which are currently unknown. This action is crucial for determining the correct treatment.

3. **Admit(Hathaway, Ross, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room C, increasing their workload to 3. This is necessary to ensure that Ross is also assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

4. **Assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom(Ross), PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room C. This action is essential for identifying Ross's symptoms, which are also currently unknown.

5. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics in Exam Room A. Since Young is already assigned to this room and has a fever (symptom of Flaze), this treatment will make Young healthy.

6. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Assuming Jones has a fever (symptom of Flaze), Hathaway treats him with antibiotics in Exam Room B. This will make Jones healthy as well.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions ensure that all patients are assigned to exam rooms and assessed for their symptoms, which is critical for proper treatment.
- The next two actions continue the process of admitting and assessing all patients, ensuring that Hathaway can treat them appropriately.
- The last two actions focus on treating Young and Jones, ensuring they receive the correct treatment based on their symptoms, which leads to their recovery.
