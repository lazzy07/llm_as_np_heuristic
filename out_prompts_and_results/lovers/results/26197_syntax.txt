To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) to check for the chocolates (I2) that they want. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially pick up or trade items.

2. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to follow Casey. This is important as Alex needs to be near Casey to communicate and potentially trade items.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This is necessary for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

4. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be in a position to interact with Casey and Blake.

5. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to be closer to the action and to potentially trade items.

6. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R12)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) they just picked up for the jewelry (I1) from Blake. This is crucial as it allows Casey to help Alex by giving them the item they want.

7. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex gets the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1), achieving their goal of happiness.
