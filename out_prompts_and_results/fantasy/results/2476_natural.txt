To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory picks up the treasure in the cave.** This action is necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and Rory needs to acquire it to increase their wealth.

2. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** Rory needs to return to the village to be with Talia and Vince, as they are all married, and Rory's happiness is tied to being with them.

3. **Rory gives the treasure to Vince.** This action is important because Vince has the money, and by giving the treasure to Vince, Rory can ensure that they all share in the wealth, which contributes to Rory's happiness.

4. **Rory, Talia, and Vince celebrate together.** This action is implied as a result of the previous actions, leading to Rory's happiness being fulfilled through companionship and shared wealth.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Rory picks up the treasure in the cave (to increase wealth).
2. Rory travels from the cave to the village (to be with Talia and Vince).
3. Rory gives the treasure to Vince (to share wealth and increase happiness).
4. Rory, Talia, and Vince celebrate together (to achieve happiness).

Here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Rory picks up the treasure in the cave.",
    "Rory travels from the cave to the village.",
    "Rory gives the treasure to Vince."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
