**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Ernest and Roy realize they need to act quickly to avoid the bully's threats. They decide to split up to increase their chances of survival.

1. **Ernest moves to the kitchen.** (He needs to retrieve the knife to defend himself and Roy against the bully.)
2. **Roy stays in the laundry room.** (He plans to keep an eye on the bully's movements and wait for Ernest to return with the knife.)
3. **Ernest steals the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is crucial for Ernest to have a means of defense against the bully.)
4. **Ernest then crawls through the vents to the gym.** (He wants to confront the bully while he is alone in the gym.)
5. **Ernest locks the gym door behind him.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that they are alone.)
6. **Ernest confronts the bully and kills him with the knife.** (This action allows Ernest to eliminate the threat to both himself and Roy.)

At this point, the bully is dead, and Ernest has successfully overcome the threat. However, the noise of the struggle attracts the attention of the guards.

7. **The guards arrive and confiscate the knife from Ernest.** (This action is necessary as it leads to the punishment of Ernest.)
8. **The guards punish Ernest by making him clean the highway.** (This is the consequence of his actions, and it leads to his eventual demise.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to either retrieve an item necessary for defense or to confront the bully, who poses a direct threat to both Ernest and Roy.
- The locking of the gym door is a strategic move to ensure that the bully cannot escape and that Ernest can confront him without interference.
- The final actions involving the guards are necessary to show the consequences of Ernest's actions, leading to his death.
