Zoe, the space explorer, finds herself on the dangerous surface of the planet, where a volcano is about to erupt. She knows she needs to make friends with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a positive relationship, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is important as it helps them find a secure location.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, solidifying their newfound friendship and ensuring both characters are safe from the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This event highlights the importance of their earlier actions in ensuring their safety.

By making peace with the Lizard and moving to the cave, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend.
