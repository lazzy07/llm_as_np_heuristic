To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and wants to be at the Cottage. This action moves him to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit is at the Crossroads and prefers to be at the Bandit Camp. This action moves her to her preferred location, which is necessary to keep her away from Tom.

3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant is at the Market and will walk to the Crossroads. This action is included to ensure that the Merchant is not in the Market when Tom is there, as it could complicate his goal.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard is also at the Market and will walk to the Crossroads. This action is included to ensure that the Guard is not in the Market when Tom is there, as it could complicate his goal.

After these actions, Tom will be at the Cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal without any conflict with the other characters.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom moves to the Cottage, where he wants to be with the medicine.
2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit moves to the Camp, ensuring she is not a threat to Tom.
3. **walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves to the Crossroads, but this is not necessary for Tom's goal.
4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads, but this is not necessary for Tom's goal.
