To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomA and Ross is assigned there, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross based on assessment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Young, who is currently there. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young based on assessment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified during the assessment. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will successfully treat both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
