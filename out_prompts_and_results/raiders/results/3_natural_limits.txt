**Story Completion:**

Indiana Jones stands at the ancient site of Tanis, knowing the Ark of the Covenant is buried beneath the sands. The Nazis, intent on obtaining the Ark for their own nefarious purposes, are also present. Indiana knows that the Ark is dangerous, but he believes it must not fall into the hands of the Nazis. 

1. **Indiana digs up the Ark.** (He believes it is at Tanis and wants to secure it before the Nazis can get to it.)
2. **The Nazis attempt to take the Ark from Indiana by force.** (They are armed and want the Ark for themselves.)
3. **Indiana, being quick-witted, opens the Ark.** (He knows it is dangerous, but he hopes to use its power against the Nazis.)
4. **The Ark unleashes its deadly power, killing the Nazis.** (This ensures that they cannot use the Ark for their immortality.)
5. **Indiana is left standing, having survived the encounter.** (He is now the sole possessor of the Ark and can ensure it is kept safe from misuse.)
6. **Indiana travels back to the USA with the Ark.** (His goal is to hand it over to the U.S. Army for safekeeping.)
