Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A with Jones, realizes that Jones is experiencing Fever, which indicates he has Flaze. However, with a workload of 3, Hathaway is at risk of making a mistake if he assesses another patient. To ensure Jones receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Jones immediately.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, and the treatment for Flaze is antibiotics. By treating Jones correctly, he will become healthy.

After treating Jones, Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Jones is now healthy. 

Next, Hathaway needs to address Ross and Young, who are still in the admissions room and have unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is now manageable, he can admit Ross and Young to their respective exam rooms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** This action is also necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

Now, Hathaway can assess Ross and Young in their assigned rooms.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

Assuming Ross is found to have a rash, he would be treated for Jarkis, ensuring he also becomes healthy. 

At this point, both Jones and Ross are healthy, and Young can be assessed next, ensuring all patients are treated correctly.

**Final Explanation:**
- The actions taken ensure that Dr. Hathaway treats Jones correctly for Flaze, reducing the workload and allowing for the admission of Ross and Young. Assessing Ross allows for the identification of his condition, leading to appropriate treatment. This sequence of actions ensures that all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
