To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1, which is jewelry). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and Blake.

2. **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22). This is necessary because Blake is currently holding the jewelry, and Casey needs to facilitate the transfer to Alex.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). This is the final step to ensure Alex receives the item they want, thus making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry they desire, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex and Blake to interact with them.
- **give(C3, I1, C2, R22)**: Casey facilitates the transfer of the jewelry from Blake to Alex, ensuring that Alex can eventually receive it.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy.
