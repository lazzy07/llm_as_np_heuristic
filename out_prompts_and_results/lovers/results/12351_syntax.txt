To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. Blake currently does not have an item, and they want to make Alex happy by giving them the item they desire (I1). 

Here's the shortest story to achieve this:

1. **Blake picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room (R21)**: This action is necessary because Blake needs an item to give to Alex. 
2. **Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Blake to fulfill their desire to make Alex happy by giving them the item they want (I1).
3. **Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from Casey (C3)**: This action is necessary for Alex to achieve their happiness since they want the flowers (I1) that Casey has.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have given an item to Alex, and Alex is happy because they received the item they wanted. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pick_up(Blake, I2, R21)**: Blake needs to have an item to give to Alex, so they pick up the chocolates.
- **give(Blake, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates to Alex, which makes Alex happy, fulfilling Blake's goal of making Alex happy.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, C3)**: Alex picks up the flowers from Casey, achieving their own happiness.
