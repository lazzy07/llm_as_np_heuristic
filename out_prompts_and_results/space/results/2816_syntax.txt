To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing for the possibility of Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and potentially resolve their relationship.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendship between them, which is one of Zoe's goals.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action introduces the danger of the environment, which is a key element of the story.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to the destruction of the surface and resulting in the death of Zoe, who is still on the surface when the eruption occurs.

This sequence of actions ensures that the story ends with the volcano erupting, Zoe dying, and the Lizard and Zoe having made peace before the eruption, thus achieving their goals of safety and friendship.
