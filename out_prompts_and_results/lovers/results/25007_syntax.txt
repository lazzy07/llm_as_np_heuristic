To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where Casey is located (R22) to retrieve the jewelry.
2. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy.
3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves back to the room (R21) after receiving the jewelry.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Alex to reach Casey, who has the jewelry.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, which is the item they want to be happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R21)**: This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but is included to return to the original room after obtaining the item.
