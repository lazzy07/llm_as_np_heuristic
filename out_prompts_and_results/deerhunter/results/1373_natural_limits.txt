Bubba, feeling hungry and determined to get money, decides to take action. He sees Bambi in the forest and, knowing he has a loaded rifle, he aims it at Bambi. 

1. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi, which will satisfy his hunger. Additionally, killing Bambi aligns with his goal of having money, as he can later use the deer to barter or trade for money.
