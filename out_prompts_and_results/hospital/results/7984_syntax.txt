To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients and achieves their goal of making them healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Ross**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross in the admissions room to determine his symptoms as well. This is important for the same reason as assessing Jones.

3. **Assess Young**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine his symptoms. This completes the assessment of all patients.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room A for treatment.

5. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then admit Ross to Exam Room B for treatment.

6. **Admit Young to Exam Room C**: Lastly, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room C for treatment.

8. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway will treat Ross in Exam Room B based on the symptoms assessed earlier.
