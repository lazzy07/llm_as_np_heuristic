**Story Completion:**

The bandit, armed with her sword, decides to take advantage of the chaos at the market. She approaches the guard, who is distracted by the aftermath of the merchant's attack. 

1. The bandit attacks the guard. (This action is taken because the bandit wants to eliminate any threats to her goal of acquiring coins.)
2. The bandit loots the guard's corpse. (After successfully attacking the guard, the bandit can now take the guard's sword and any coins he may have had, furthering her goal of accumulating wealth.)
3. The bandit walks to the chest at the bandit camp. (With the coins she has taken from the guard, she can now secure them in her chest at the bandit camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The bandit attacks the guard to remove a potential threat, as the guard's goal is to kill criminals, which includes her.
- Looting the guard allows the bandit to gain more coins, which is essential for her goal of having as many coins as possible.
- Walking to the bandit camp to secure the coins in her chest fulfills her ultimate goal of accumulating wealth without being caught.
