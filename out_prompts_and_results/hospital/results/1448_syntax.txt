To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Jones's health status is currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk Ross to Exam Room C**: Ross, who is currently in the admissions room, will walk to Exam Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is in a location where he can be assessed and treated if needed.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is important to ensure that Ross's health is also taken care of, as he is another patient in the hospital.

5. **Treat Ross**: Depending on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment. This ensures that all patients are being cared for, which aligns with Hathaway's goal of wanting all hospital patients to be healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: This action is taken to identify Jones's condition.
2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: This action is taken to treat Jones based on the assessment.
3. **walk(Ross, Admissions, PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to move Ross to a location where he can be assessed.
4. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to identify Ross's condition.
5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomC)**: This action is taken to treat Ross based on the assessment.

By following these actions, Jones will achieve his goal of being alive and healthy, and Ross will also receive the necessary care.
