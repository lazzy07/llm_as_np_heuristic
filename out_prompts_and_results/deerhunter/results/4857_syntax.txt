To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants money, which he can obtain from the bank clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because it allows Bubba to regain energy and continue with his plans without the distraction of hunger.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba goes to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is essential as it brings Bubba closer to his goal of obtaining money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Bubba's greedy desire for money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his goal.
2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Moves Bubba to the location where he can obtain money.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Accomplishes Bubba's goal of acquiring money.
