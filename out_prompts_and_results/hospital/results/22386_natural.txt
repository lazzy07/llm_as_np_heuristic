**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, after assessing Jones and noting the fever, decides to admit Ross to Patient Room B to ensure he receives attention. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.)
2. **Ross walks from Admissions to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary for Ross to be in the correct location for assessment and treatment.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and observes Unknown symptoms.** (This action is necessary to determine what Ross is experiencing so that he can be treated appropriately.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.** (This action is necessary because Ross's symptoms are unknown, but since he is in the hospital, it is assumed he needs treatment. The story will assume that the treatment is appropriate for the unknown condition.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to return to Admissions to assess Young.)
6. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
7. **Young walks from Admissions to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary for Young to be in the correct location for assessment and treatment.)
8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young and observes Unknown symptoms.** (This action is necessary to determine what Young is experiencing so that he can be treated appropriately.)
9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.** (This action is necessary because Young's symptoms are unknown, but since he is in the hospital, it is assumed he needs treatment. The story will assume that the treatment is appropriate for the unknown condition.)
10. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.** (This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to return to Admissions to check on Jones.)
11. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics.** (This action is necessary because Jones has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze, and he needs the correct treatment to become healthy.)

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, ensuring they are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is taken to ensure that all patients are assessed and treated appropriately based on their symptoms or the assumption of needing treatment.
- The sequence of admitting, walking, assessing, and treating is crucial to ensure that Dr. Hathaway's workload remains manageable and that no mistakes are made due to overload.
