In the current situation, the Bandit has already attacked both the Guard and the Merchant, leaving them dead. The Bandit is now in possession of the Merchant's sword and has the opportunity to loot the Merchant's items. The Bandit's goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the Bandit has already attacked and killed the Merchant, the next logical action is to loot the Merchant for the coins.

**Action:**
1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)** - The Bandit loots the coins from the Merchant's corpse.

This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible. By looting the Merchant, the Bandit can add the coins to her inventory, thus fulfilling her objective.

**Final Plan in JSON format:**
