To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can follow these actions:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Admit Jones to PatientRoomC**: After treating Young, Hathaway will admit Jones to PatientRoomC. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated in the next steps, as they are currently in the admissions room.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine if they have Flaze or Jarkis. This is crucial for the next step, as the treatment depends on the correct diagnosis.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: Assuming Young has Flaze (fever), Hathaway treats them with antibiotics. This action is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy, as it directly addresses Young's condition.

3. **Admit Jones to PatientRoomC**: Hathaway admits Jones to PatientRoomC to prepare for their assessment and treatment in the future. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are accounted for and can receive the care they need.

By following these actions, Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring they are healthy, and prepares to address Jones's health next.
