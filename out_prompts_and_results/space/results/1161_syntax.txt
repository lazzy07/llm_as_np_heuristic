To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action has already been taken, so the volcano is in the process of erupting.
2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave to find the Lizard, hoping to make peace.
3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard walks to the surface, where the volcano is about to erupt.
4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace, establishing a friendship.
5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, resulting in the death of one character.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action sets the stage for the volcano to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe moves to the cave to find the Lizard, showing her intention to communicate and resolve their differences.
- **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard's movement to the surface indicates that it is aware of the impending eruption and is responding to the situation.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action is crucial as it allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends, fulfilling their mutual desire for companionship and safety.
- **erupt(Surface)**: The eruption occurs after the characters have made peace, leading to the death of one character (in this case, Zoe, as she is on the surface when the eruption happens).

The final outcome is that the volcano erupts, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard and Zoe have established a friendship before the eruption.
