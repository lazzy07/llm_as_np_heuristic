In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). 

Here's the sequence of actions:

1. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Blake to interact with Alex and help them achieve happiness.

2. **give(C2, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) they have to Alex (C1) in the living room (R22). This action is taken because Blake believes that by giving Alex something, they can help them feel happy, even if itâ€™s not the item they truly want. 

After this action, Alex is still not happy because they want the flowers (I1), but Blake's intention was to help Alex feel good, which is a step towards achieving their goal of happiness.
