To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of acquiring money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest, has a rifle loaded with ammunition, and has just shot Bambi, which means he can now eat Bambi to satisfy his hunger. However, he is also greedy and wants to get more money. The bank clerk is still alive and at the bank, and Bubba can steal money from the clerk if he returns to the bank.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Bubba eats Bambi to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary because Bubba is currently hungry, and eating will help him regain energy and focus on his next goal.

2. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: After eating, Bubba will go back to the bank. This action is necessary to confront the bank clerk and attempt to steal money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will steal from the bank clerk using his rifle. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money, and the clerk has none, making this the only way to achieve his goal.

4. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba decides to take the money from the clerk. This action is necessary to fulfill his greed and achieve his goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Satisfies Bubba's hunger.
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Returns to the bank to confront the clerk.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Takes money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed.
- **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finalizes his goal of acquiring money.
