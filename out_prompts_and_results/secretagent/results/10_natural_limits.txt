The secret agent, determined to eliminate the mastermind, takes the following actions:

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. 
   - This action is necessary because the secret agent needs to be in the same location as the mastermind to carry out the plan.

2. The secret agent moves from the lobby to the cache.
   - This action is not strictly necessary for the goal but allows the secret agent to create a diversion, making it seem like they are not immediately threatening the mastermind.

3. The secret agent moves from the cache back to the lobby.
   - This action brings the secret agent back to the lobby, where the mastermind is likely to be, allowing the secret agent to confront the mastermind.

4. The secret agent picks up the gun in the office.
   - This action is crucial as the secret agent needs the gun to kill the mastermind.

5. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby.
   - This action allows the secret agent to confront the mastermind with the gun in hand.

6. The secret agent kills the mastermind in the lobby.
   - This is the final action that achieves the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

The sequence of actions is designed to ensure that the secret agent can confront the mastermind directly and eliminate them without any unnecessary movements or distractions.
