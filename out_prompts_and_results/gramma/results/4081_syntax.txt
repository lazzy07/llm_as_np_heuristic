To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, BanditCamp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves to the Crossroads, where she can potentially interact with Tom and the Merchant.
2. **report(Merchant, spot: BanditCamp, place: Market)**: The Merchant reports the Bandit's location to the Guard, which is a strategic move to ensure the Bandit is dealt with and does not pose a threat to her business.
3. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard moves to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report.
4. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard attacks the Bandit, who is not armed with a sword, thus eliminating her as a threat.
5. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant loots the coins from the Bandit's corpse, adding to her wealth.

### Explanation of Actions:
