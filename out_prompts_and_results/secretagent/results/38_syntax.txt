To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must take the following actions:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. This is necessary because the agent needs to confront the mastermind, who is believed to be in the same location.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent uses the gun to kill the mastermind in the lobby. This action directly fulfills the goal of the secret agent, which is to ensure the mastermind is dead.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: The secret agent moves to the lobby to confront the mastermind. This is essential as the agent needs to be in the same location as the mastermind to carry out the next action.

2. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Lobby)**: The secret agent kills the mastermind using the gun. This is the ultimate goal of the secret agent, ensuring that the mastermind is dead.

The actions are minimal and directly lead to the desired outcome of the mastermind being dead.
