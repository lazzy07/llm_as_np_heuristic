**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.** - The bandit needs to create a diversion and mislead the guard about her location.
   
2. **The bandit approaches the guard and reports the location of the bandit.** - This action is a clever ruse; the bandit is essentially tricking the guard into thinking there is another bandit, which allows her to escape scrutiny.

3. **The guard walks to the crossroads to investigate.** - The guard believes the bandit is at the crossroads due to the report, which takes him away from the market and allows the bandit to act freely.

4. **The bandit walks back to the crossroads.** - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp without the guard's presence, ensuring she can access her coins.

5. **The bandit loots the chest at the bandit camp, retrieving the bandit's coin.** - This final action fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, as she now has the coins in her possession.
