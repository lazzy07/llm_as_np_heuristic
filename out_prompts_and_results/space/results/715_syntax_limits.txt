Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the imminent danger posed by the volcano that has begun to erupt. She knows that she needs to make peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to build a relationship between them.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting, which results in a dangerous situation for both characters.

In this scenario, Zoe and the Lizard successfully make peace just before the eruption, which signifies a moment of unity despite the impending danger. However, the eruption ultimately leads to the demise of one character, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying.
