To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the room where the item I2 (chocolates) is located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to interact with.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room. This is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the room where they were previously (R22). This is necessary to ensure that Alex is in a position to interact with other characters if needed.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C2). This action is crucial because it allows Alex to fulfill their desire to make Casey happy, which is part of Alex's goal.

5. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Alex to interact.

6. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Casey trades the chocolates (I2) with Blake (C3) for the flowers (I1). This action allows both Casey and Blake to achieve their happiness by obtaining the items they want.

7. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex has the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Alex moves to the room with the chocolates.
2. Alex picks up the flowers.
3. Alex returns to the original room.
4. Alex gives the flowers to Casey.
5. Casey moves to Alex's room.
6. Casey trades chocolates with Blake for the flowers.
7. Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.

By following these actions, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
