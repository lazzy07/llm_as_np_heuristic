After Hawkins spreads the rumor that the treasure is buried on the island, both he and Silver sail to the island. Once they arrive, Silver, believing the treasure is indeed buried there, decides to dig it up. Hawkins, wanting the treasure for himself, watches as Silver digs. After Silver successfully uncovers the treasure, he takes it for himself, achieving his goal.

1. **dig()**: Silver digs up the treasure because he believes it is buried on the island, which aligns with his goal of obtaining the treasure.
2. **take(Silver, Treasure)**: After digging up the treasure, Silver takes it, fulfilling his desire for the treasure.
