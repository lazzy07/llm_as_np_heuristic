**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in PatientRoomA, where Ross is assigned. Ross is showing symptoms of SymptomA, which Hathaway believes to be true. Since Hathaway's workload is only 1, they can accurately assess and treat Ross without making a mistake.

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomA and confirms that he has SymptomA. This action is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Ross.
   
2. **Treat Ross**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, the disease associated with SymptomA. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

Next, Hathaway needs to address Jones, who is in the admissions room and also has SymptomA. 

3. **Admit Jones to PatientRoomB**: Hathaway admits Jones to PatientRoomB. This action is necessary to ensure that Jones can be assessed and treated in the next steps.
