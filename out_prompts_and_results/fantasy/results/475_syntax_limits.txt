In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire money and treasure while ensuring he is not hungry. 

Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory decides to travel to the cave where Talia is located, as he believes she may have found treasure there. This action is necessary for Rory to be with Talia and potentially access the treasure.

2. **Pickup Treasure**: Upon arriving at the cave, Rory picks up the treasure. This action is crucial because it directly contributes to Rory's wealth, which is one of his goals.

3. **Get Hungry**: After picking up the treasure, Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to reflect the natural consequence of his journey and to set up the next action.

4. **Travel back to Village**: Rory then travels back to the village, where he can find food to satisfy his hunger. This action is necessary to ensure he is not hungry anymore.

5. **Accept Talia's Proposal**: Finally, Rory accepts Talia's proposal of marriage. This action makes both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

By following these actions, Rory achieves his goals of being happy, wealthy (through the treasure), and not hungry (by returning to the village for food).

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

Each action is necessary to ensure Rory achieves his goals while keeping the story concise and focused.
