Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway needs to determine what is wrong with him. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to reach Ross and assess his condition.
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** This action allows Hathaway to assign Ross to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and observes Rash.** This action is crucial as it reveals that Ross is experiencing the same symptoms as Jones, indicating he has Jarkis.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids.** This action is essential for Ross's recovery, as steroids are the correct treatment for Jarkis. 

After these actions, both Jones and Ross are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
