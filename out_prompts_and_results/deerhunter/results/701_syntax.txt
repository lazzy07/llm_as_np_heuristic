To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This is necessary because he needs to be armed to intimidate the bank clerk and potentially steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is crucial as it directly leads to Bubba acquiring the money he desires.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba leaves the bank and goes to the forest. This action is important for Bubba to escape the scene and avoid any potential consequences.

4. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Bubba decides to eat, which indicates he is still hungry after his actions. This action is included to show that Bubba is taking care of his needs after achieving his goal.

5. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, the deer. This action is included to fulfill Bubba's hunger and shows that he is taking advantage of the resources available to him in the forest.

The story is structured to ensure that Bubba successfully steals the money from the bank clerk and then satisfies his hunger by eating Bambi, thus achieving his goals.
