**Story Completion:**

After completing their daily chores, Roy finds himself in the hallway, contemplating his next move. He knows that both he and Ernest are threatened by the bully, who has been eyeing them ever since Roy stole the civilian clothes. With the pack of cigarettes in Ernest's possession, the bully is likely to retaliate.

Roy decides to take action. He knows that the gym door is unlocked, and the bully is inside. He quickly moves to the gym and locks the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from escaping and allows Roy to confront him without the risk of outside interference.

Next, Roy takes the knife he has hidden in the laundry room and confronts the bully. He knows that this is a dangerous move, but he is determined to protect himself and Ernest. In a swift motion, he kills the bully, ensuring that they are no longer threatened.
