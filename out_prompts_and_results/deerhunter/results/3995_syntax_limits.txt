To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the action that will achieve the goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and take the money.

This action is necessary because Bubba needs to be at the bank to access the money that the clerk has. Since Bambi is already dead, this action will ensure that Bubba can achieve his goal of obtaining money.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Bubba will be at the bank.
- Bambi will still be dead.
- Bubba will have the opportunity to take the money from the clerk.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way to ensure that Bubba can achieve his goal of having money while confirming that Bambi is dead.
