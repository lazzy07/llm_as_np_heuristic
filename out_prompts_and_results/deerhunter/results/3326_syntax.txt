To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba has already shot Bambi, which means Bambi is dead. However, Bubba still needs to get the money from the bank clerk. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go back to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will return to the forest. This action is not strictly necessary for the ending but provides a sense of closure to the story.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk and take the money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling the requirement of having money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: This action is included to show Bubba leaving the bank after successfully stealing the money.

At the end of these actions, Bubba will have the money, and Bambi is already dead, satisfying the conditions of the story.
