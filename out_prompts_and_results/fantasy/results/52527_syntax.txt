To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has already accepted Vince's proposal, she is on her way to happiness through marriage. However, to also achieve wealth, we need to ensure she acquires the money or treasure.

Here's the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness and wealth:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax, who is hungry, travels to the village where Talia, Rory, and Vince are located. This action is necessary because Gargax needs to be in the same location as the humans to eat one of them.

2. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Village)**: Gargax eats Vince. This action is crucial because it allows Gargax to satisfy his hunger and also allows him to take the money that Vince had.

3. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Village)**: Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body. This action is necessary for Gargax to become wealthy, but it also indirectly benefits Talia since she is now the only one left with a relationship that can lead to happiness.

4. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia marries Rory. This action ensures Talia becomes happy as she is now in a committed relationship.

5. **pickup(Talia, Money, Village)**: Talia picks up the money that Gargax has just taken from Vince. This action allows Talia to become wealthy.

After these actions, Talia is both happy (due to her marriage to Rory) and wealthy (due to acquiring the money).
