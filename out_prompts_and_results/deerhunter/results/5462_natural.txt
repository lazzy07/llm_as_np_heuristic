To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the clerk is located, as he needs to interact with the clerk to obtain money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of having 1 money.

3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - After stealing the money, Bubba needs to return to the forest, which is a safe location for him.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Go to the bank:** Bubba needs to be at the bank to interact with the clerk.
- **Steal the money:** This is the action that allows Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.
- **Go back to the forest:** This ensures Bubba is in a safe location after obtaining the money.
