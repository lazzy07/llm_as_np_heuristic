To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room B and Jones is assigned there, Hathaway can assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Ross in Admissions**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will walk to the Admissions room to assess Ross. This is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Ross**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also essential for Ross's recovery.

5. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room A to assess Young. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide treatment.

6. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.
