Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to leave the cave and head back to the surface to assess the situation together. As they step outside, the ground shakes violently, and the volcano erupts, sending molten lava flowing toward them. In a desperate attempt to escape, Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, but the Lizard, unable to teleport, is caught in the eruption and perishes.

This action sequence is necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and a character dies. The story emphasizes the friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, highlighting their mutual desire for safety and health, but ultimately leads to a tragic outcome due to the uncontrollable nature of the volcano.
