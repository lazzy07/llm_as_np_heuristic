To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to avoid confrontation with the Guard and to keep her coins safe in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins without risking being attacked.

2. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk to the Market to be in a location where she can sell items and potentially acquire more coins. This is essential for her goal of maximizing her coin collection.

3. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom will walk to the Cottage to carry the medicine there, which is his goal. This action does not directly affect the Merchant's goal but is necessary for Tom to fulfill his own objective.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to keep an eye on the situation and ensure that no criminal activities are happening. This action is necessary for the Guard to maintain order.

5. **report(Merchant, location(Bandit), Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit's location to the Guard, which will help the Guard to take action against the Bandit. This action is crucial for the Merchant to ensure her safety and to avoid being associated with criminal activities.

6. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads to confront the Bandit based on the Merchant's report. This action is necessary for the Guard to fulfill his duty.

7. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, as she is a criminal. This action is necessary to eliminate the threat posed by the Bandit and to protect the Merchant.

8. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit for her coins. This action is essential for the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.
