The bandit, seeing the merchant armed and holding the medicine, decides to take action. She approaches the merchant and, with her sword drawn, she threatens the merchant to hand over the medicine. The merchant, realizing the danger, complies and gives the medicine to the bandit. 

With the medicine now in her possession, the bandit quickly retreats back to the bandit camp, satisfied with her haul. She has successfully achieved her goal of carrying the medicine.
