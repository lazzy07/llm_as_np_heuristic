In the current situation, Talia is in the cave and has already taken the money from Vince, who is now dead. To achieve her goal of being happy and wealthy, Talia needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since she is already in the cave, she can simply pick up the treasure.

**Action:**
1. `pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)`

**Explanation:**
- Talia picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is necessary for her to achieve her goal of being wealthy, as the treasure will increase her wealth.

After this action, Talia will have both the money and the treasure, fulfilling her desire to be wealthy. Since she is already engaged to Rory, who has accepted her proposal, she will also be happy.
