To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial to ensure Young becomes healthy.
