To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, who is hungry and greedy, will decide to shoot Bambi, the deer, in the forest. This action serves two purposes: it satisfies Bubba's hunger by potentially allowing him to eat Bambi later, and it also eliminates Bambi, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba will eat the deer. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the kill.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Although Bubba already has the desire for money, this action reinforces his greed and ensures that he is focused on acquiring wealth, which he can do later by returning to the bank.

This sequence of actions leads to the conclusion that Bambi is dead, satisfying one of the conditions for the ending. Bubba's hunger is also addressed, and he remains greedy, which sets him up for future actions to acquire money.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan is efficient and meets the requirements of the story while keeping the number of actions to a minimum.
