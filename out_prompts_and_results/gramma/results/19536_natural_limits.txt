The bandit, realizing that the merchant is at the market with the medicine, decides to take action. She walks from the market to the crossroads, where she encounters the hero. The bandit, armed with her sword, sees that the hero is also armed but believes she can outsmart him. 

The bandit then reports her location to the guard, who is still at the market. The guard, believing the bandit is at the crossroads, rushes to confront her. As the guard arrives, the bandit quickly retreats back to the market, where she can safely access the chest containing her coins.

Once at the bandit camp, she retrieves the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.

2. The bandit reports her location to the guard, which prompts the guard to leave the market, allowing her to return safely.
3. The bandit walks back to the market and then to the bandit camp to retrieve her coins, fulfilling her goal.
