**Story Completion:**

Ernest, locked in the gym with the bully, knows he must act quickly to ensure both his and Roy's survival. He grips the knife tightly, feeling the weight of the situation. With a surge of determination, he lunges at the bully, using the knife to kill him before he can threaten them any further. 

With the bully now out of the way, Ernest takes a moment to catch his breath. He knows he needs to escape and quickly puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. He then unlocks the gym door and makes his way to the hallway. 

Once in the hallway, he crawls through the vents to reach the highway outside the prison. There, he takes a deep breath of freedom, knowing he has successfully escaped and is now alive, having achieved his goal.
