**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is experiencing a rash, decides to treat Jones for Jarkis, as that is the disease associated with a rash. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the immediate priority is to treat Jones.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis.** 
   - This action is necessary because Jones is showing symptoms of a rash, which indicates he has Jarkis. Treating him with steroids will make him healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload is reduced to 2. Next, Hathaway needs to assess the other patients to ensure they are also treated properly.

2. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**
   - This action is necessary to reach Ross and Young, who are currently in Admissions, so Hathaway can assess their conditions.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross.**
   - This action is necessary to determine what symptoms Ross is experiencing. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway needs to assess him to provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**
   - This action is necessary to determine what symptoms Young is experiencing. Similar to Ross, Young's symptoms are unknown, and Hathaway needs to assess him as well.

After assessing both Ross and Young, Hathaway discovers that both are also experiencing unknown symptoms. Given that Hathaway's workload is now 0, he can treat both patients without the risk of making a mistake.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Ross receives treatment. Since Ross's symptoms were unknown, Hathaway assumes he has Jarkis and treats him accordingly.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**
   - This action is necessary to ensure Young receives treatment as well. Similar to Ross, Hathaway assumes Young has Jarkis and treats him.

By treating all three patients, Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Dr. Hathaway is aimed at assessing and treating the patients to ensure their health. The sequence of actions is designed to minimize the risk of mistakes while maximizing the number of patients treated successfully.
