Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano rumbles ominously, and both know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.** This action is taken because Zoe wants to ensure her safety and health, and by moving to the spaceship, she can avoid the imminent danger of the volcano. Although this action would typically anger the Lizard, they are friends now, and the urgency of the situation takes precedence.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.** The Lizard chooses to walk to the cave, which is a safer location than the surface, especially with the volcano threatening to erupt. This action helps the Lizard achieve its goal of being safe and healthy.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.** Zoe, now safe on the spaceship, teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action reinforces their friendship and ensures that both characters are together in a safe location.

In this short story, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also maintaining their friendship.
