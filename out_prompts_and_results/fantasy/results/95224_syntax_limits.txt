To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we can take the following action:

1. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)** - Vince travels from the Village to the Cave. This action is necessary because Vince has money, and Talia needs to be in the same location as Vince to access the money.

2. **take(Talia, Money, Vince, Cave)** - Talia takes the money from Vince. This action is crucial because Talia wants to be wealthy, and acquiring money will help her achieve that goal.

3. **get_hungry(Talia)** - Talia becomes hungry. This action is included to show that Talia is not concerned about her hunger, aligning with her character's desire for wealth and happiness over physical needs.

4. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)** - Talia marries Rory. This action is included because Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, and marrying him will make both of them happy.

5. **marry(Vince, Talia, Cave)** - Talia marries Vince. This action is included because Talia has also accepted Vince's proposal, and marrying him will also contribute to her happiness.
