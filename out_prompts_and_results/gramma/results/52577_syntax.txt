To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is already at the Camp, so she will walk to the Crossroads to be in a position to interact with Tom, who is at the Market.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market where Tom is located. This is necessary for the Bandit to confront Tom and potentially rob him.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom of the coins he is carrying. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully take the coins without any resistance.

4. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk back to the Camp to secure the coins in the chest.

5. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins she just acquired from Tom and place them in the chest at the Camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.
