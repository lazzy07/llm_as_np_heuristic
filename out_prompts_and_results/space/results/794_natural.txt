Zoe is at the cave, and the Lizard is at the surface, where the volcano is erupting. To ensure the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe, the following actions will take place:

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary because Zoe needs to be on the surface to interact with the Lizard and help it. Although this action makes the Lizard angry, it is essential for Zoe to be present where the Lizard is.

2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, showing her intention to communicate and make peace rather than fight.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - This action is crucial as it allows both characters to become friends. By making peace, Zoe demonstrates her desire for friendship, which aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave together.** - This action ensures that both characters move to a safer location away from the erupting volcano, thus achieving their goal of safety.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard become friends.** - This final action solidifies their relationship, ensuring that both characters feel safe and healthy in their newfound friendship.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with Zoe.
