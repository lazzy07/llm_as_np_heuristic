Bubba, after shooting Bambi, realizes he is still hungry and wants to eat. He decides to eat Bambi, which is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to regain energy. After eating, Bubba feels more capable of achieving his goal of obtaining money. 

Next, Bubba decides to go back to the bank. He knows the clerk has money, and since he has the rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba points the rifle at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, believing Bubba is dangerous with the rifle, hands over the money to Bubba. 

Now, Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. Bubba decides to eat (to satisfy his hunger).
2. Bubba eats Bambi (to regain energy and satisfy his hunger).
3. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank (to confront the clerk).
4. Bubba shoots the clerk (to intimidate and force the clerk to give him money).
5. Bubba takes the money from the clerk (to achieve his goal of having 1 money).

Each action is necessary to ensure Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money while also addressing his hunger.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to eat",
    "Bubba eats Bambi",
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk",
    "Bubba takes the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
