To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while Bambi is alive in the forest. The bank clerk has the money but is not in the forest, so Bubba cannot steal it from the clerk directly. However, Bubba can use the rifle to shoot Bambi, which would allow him to eat and potentially satisfy his hunger.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba needs to eliminate Bambi to either eat or gain something from the situation.
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** - This action fulfills the requirement of Bambi being dead, and it also allows Bubba to eat, which may help with his hunger.
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger after having killed Bambi.

At this point, Bubba has achieved his goal of satisfying his hunger, and Bambi is dead. The story ends here, as Bubba does not need to acquire money from the clerk to fulfill the requirement of the ending.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to shoot Bambi:** Bubba needs to take action to either eat or gain something, and shooting Bambi is a direct way to achieve that.
- **Shoot and kill Bambi:** This action directly leads to Bambi's death, which is one of the conditions for the ending.
- **Decide to eat Bambi:** This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger, which is a goal he has.
