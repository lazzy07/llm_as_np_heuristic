**Story Completion:**

1. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to communicate and potentially trade items. 

2. **Blake tells Alex that Casey wants the flowers.**  
   - This action is a lie, as Casey actually wants the jewelry. However, it is a strategic move to mislead Alex into thinking that Casey desires the flowers, which will help facilitate the next actions.

3. **Alex picks up the flowers from the living room.**  
   - Alex wants the flowers, and since they are in the living room, this action allows Alex to obtain the item they desire.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex.**  
   - Blake wants the chocolates, and by giving them to Alex, Blake can ensure that Alex is happy, which is part of Blake's goal.

5. **Alex gives the flowers to Casey.**  
   - Since Alex now has the flowers and believes that Casey wants them, this action allows Casey to receive the flowers, which makes Casey happy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to facilitate the characters achieving their goals while maintaining the integrity of the story's constraints. Blake's move to the living room allows for interaction with Alex, and the lie about Casey wanting the flowers creates a scenario where Alex is motivated to pick them up and eventually give them to Casey. This series of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by receiving the flowers.
