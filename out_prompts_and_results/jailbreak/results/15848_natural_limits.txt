**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison continued, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, stood in the hallway with the stolen pack of cigarettes and the knife. He knew that Ernest was still in the cells, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to achieve his goal of being alive and free, Roy decided to take action.

Roy crawled through the vents to the gym, where the bully was still occupied with his recreation time. Once inside the gym, Roy locked the door behind him, trapping the bully inside. With the knife in hand, Roy confronted the bully, who was taken by surprise. In a swift motion, Roy avenged the threats made against him and Ernest by killing the bully.

With the bully out of the way, Roy felt a sense of relief. He then made his way back to the hallway, ready to escape with Ernest.
