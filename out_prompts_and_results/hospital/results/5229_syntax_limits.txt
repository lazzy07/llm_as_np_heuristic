**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway needs to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for diagnosing whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Ross, treatment: antibiotics, room: PatientRoomA**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Ross has Flaze (the only disease that can be treated with antibiotics), Hathaway treats him. If Ross indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: PatientRoomC**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway now needs to assess Young, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment: steroids, room: PatientRoomC**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Young has Jarkis (the only disease that can be treated with steroids), Hathaway treats him. If Young indeed has Jarkis, he will become healthy.

**Final Explanation:**
The actions taken ensure that both Ross and Young are assessed and treated correctly based on their symptoms. By treating Ross with antibiotics and Young with steroids, Hathaway achieves the goal of making all patients healthy. The story is kept concise with only four actions, ensuring efficiency in reaching the desired outcome.
