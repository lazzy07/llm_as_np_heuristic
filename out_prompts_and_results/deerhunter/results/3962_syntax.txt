To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank, he is hungry, and he has a rifle loaded with ammunition. The bank clerk is also present and has money. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants money, and the clerk has money that Bubba can take.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe place.

3. **decide_to_eat(Bubba)**: Once at the house, Bubba will decide to eat. This action is necessary because he is hungry and needs to satisfy his hunger.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, House)**: Finally, Bubba will eat Bambi, the deer he shot earlier. This action is necessary to fulfill his hunger.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal**: Bubba needs money, and the clerk has it. This action allows Bubba to achieve his greed.
- **go**: Moving to the house ensures Bubba can secure his stolen money.
- **decide_to_eat**: Bubba is hungry, and this action indicates his intention to eat.
- **eat**: Consuming Bambi satisfies Bubba's hunger.
