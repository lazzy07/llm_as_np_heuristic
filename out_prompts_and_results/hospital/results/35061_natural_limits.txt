Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, assesses Young in Patient Room A. Upon observing the rash, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that Young has Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, the appropriate treatment for Jarkis, which successfully makes Young healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Jones, who is still waiting there. Dr. Hathaway assigns Jones to Patient Room B. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.

In this story, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, achieving the goal of making patients healthy, while also attempting to help Jones.
