To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will be taken to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R21, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R21) to the dining room (R12) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the item.

2. **give(C3, I3, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I3) to Alex in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to be with Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Casey's happiness but helps to create a more cohesive interaction among the characters.

4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R12). This action is included to ensure that Blake is also happy, as they want to make Alex happy.

5. **give(C2, I1, C3, R12)**: Blake gives the flowers (I1) to Casey (C3) in the dining room (R12). This action is included to ensure that Casey is happy with the flowers as well, even though their primary goal was to receive the jewelry.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they have received the jewelry they wanted.
