After the events that have transpired, Talia is in the cave with Rory, and Gargax is in the village. Vince is dead, and he has the money. Talia's goal is to become happy and wealthy, and she can achieve this by marrying Rory, who is also in the cave with her. 

To ensure Talia becomes happy, she can accept Rory's proposal of marriage. This will make both of them happy, and since Rory is not hungry and does not care about being rich, he will not interfere with Talia's desire for wealth.

By completing these two actions, Talia will be both happy and wealthy.
