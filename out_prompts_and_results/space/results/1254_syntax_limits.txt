Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware that the volcano could erupt at any moment. She has already made peace with the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, and they both want to be healthy and safe. To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to teleport back to the spaceship, where she can monitor the situation and be out of danger.

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety. Since the surface is dangerous due to the potential eruption, teleporting to the ship allows her to avoid any harm while still being able to communicate with the Lizard and plan for future interactions.

By taking this action, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe. The relationship with the Lizard remains intact, and they can continue to build their friendship from a safe distance.
