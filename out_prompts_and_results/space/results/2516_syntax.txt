To complete the story, Zoe and the Lizard need to solidify their friendship and ensure their safety on the dangerous surface of the planet. Since they are already in a non-fighting state and have a positive relationship, they can take actions that will help them achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard are aware that the surface is dangerous, and they need to act quickly to ensure their safety. By starting the eruption, they can create a sense of urgency that will prompt them to leave the surface.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring they are both in a safe location together.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once in the cave, Zoe and the Lizard can solidify their friendship, achieving their goal of making friends.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action creates a sense of urgency and danger, prompting both characters to seek safety.
- **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe moves to a safer location, which is essential for her safety.
- **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe, ensuring that they are both safe together.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: This action finalizes their friendship, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.
