To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where the jewelry is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Blake.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R22). This action is not necessary for achieving Blake's goal but can be included to show movement after receiving the item.

After these actions, Blake will be happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
