To complete the story, Tom needs to return to the cottage while carrying the medicine. Since he is currently at the crossroads with the medicine, he can simply walk back to the cottage. The other characters' actions do not interfere with Tom's goal, and since he has already dealt with the merchant and the bandit, there are no further complications.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom walks from the crossroads back to the cottage, carrying the medicine. This action directly achieves Tom's goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

No other actions are necessary because Tom has already eliminated the merchant and the bandit, and the guard does not pose a threat to him at this point.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it allows Tom to reach his desired location (the cottage) while carrying the medicine, fulfilling his goal.
