In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the item I3 (the item in the room that Alex wants). 

Given the current situation, the following actions will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **trade(Blake, I1, Alex, I3, R22)**: Blake can trade the jewelry (I1) they have with Alex for the flowers (I3) that Alex wants. This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making both Alex and Blake happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I3) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the jewelry (I1) and will also be happy because they helped Alex achieve their goal.

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy by ensuring Alex is happy.
