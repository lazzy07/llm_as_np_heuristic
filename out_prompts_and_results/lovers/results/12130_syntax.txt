To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where they believe the flowers (I1) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R12)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) in the dining room (R12). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) to be with Casey and Blake. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain social connections.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to themselves, which is a bit redundant but emphasizes that Alex has the item they want. This action confirms that Alex is now happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
