Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room B.** (This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.)
   
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Patient Room B.** (This action allows Dr. Hathaway to reach Young and assess their condition.)

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B.** (This action is crucial to determine Young's symptoms and decide on the appropriate treatment.)

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room B.** (Assuming Young has Flaze, Dr. Hathaway administers antibiotics, which will make Young healthy.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which aligns with their goal.
