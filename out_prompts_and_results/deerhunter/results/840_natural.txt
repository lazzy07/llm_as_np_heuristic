To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and has a rifle loaded with ammunition, while the clerk has no money. Bambi is alive in the forest and is not directly involved in the bank scenario. 

Hereâ€™s how the story can unfold:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot the clerk.** This action is taken because Bubba wants to eliminate the clerk, who is a potential obstacle to getting more money. Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can shoot the clerk.

2. **Bubba shoots and kills the clerk.** This action directly leads to the clerk's death, allowing Bubba to take the money without any resistance.

3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money that the clerk had, fulfilling his goal of having money.

4. **Bubba decides to eat.** Since Bubba is hungry, he can choose to eat the clerk, who is now dead. This action satisfies his hunger.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money and has also satisfied his hunger by eating the clerk. Bambi remains alive in the forest, but the primary goal of Bubba having the money is achieved.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to shoot the clerk:** Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to access more money.

- **Pick up the money from the clerk:** This fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.
