Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to treat Young, who is currently in Patient Room A and exhibiting a fever, a symptom of the disease Flaze. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, she can safely treat Young without making a mistake.

1. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** This action is necessary because Young has a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. By treating him with antibiotics, he will become healthy.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1, and Young is now healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway needs to address Jones and Ross, who are still in the admissions room and experiencing unknown symptoms. To ensure they receive the necessary care, Dr. Hathaway will admit Ross to Patient Room B.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B.** This action is necessary to ensure Ross is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

Now, Dr. Hathaway can assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room.

3. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.** This action is necessary to ensure Jones is assigned to an exam room where he can be assessed and treated.

At this point, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Young and admitted both Jones and Ross to their respective exam rooms, ensuring they will receive the care they need.

The final state of the story is that Young is healthy, and Jones and Ross are now in exam rooms where they can be assessed and treated, fulfilling Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
