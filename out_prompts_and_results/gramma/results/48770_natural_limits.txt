Tom, carrying the medicine, stands at the crossroads. He sees the bandit also at the crossroads, armed and dangerous. Knowing that he cannot confront the bandit directly, Tom decides to report the bandit's location to the guard, who is also at the crossroads. 

The guard, upon hearing Tom's report, immediately takes action. He approaches the bandit and, armed with his sword, attacks and kills her. With the bandit defeated, Tom can now safely walk back to the cottage carrying the medicine, having achieved his goal.
