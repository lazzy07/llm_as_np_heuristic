To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has a fever (indicating Flaze), he will receive antibiotics. If he has a rash (indicating Jarkis), he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reasons as assessing Jones.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Ross**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room C to determine his symptoms. This is the last step to ensure all patients are evaluated.

6. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on his symptoms, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy as well.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
