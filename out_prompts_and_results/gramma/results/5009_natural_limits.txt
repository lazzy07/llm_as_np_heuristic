The merchant, wanting to maximize her coins without becoming a criminal, decides to take advantage of the situation. She knows that the bandit is at the crossroads and that the guard is at the market. The merchant walks from the camp to the crossroads, where she confronts the bandit. 

Since the merchant is armed and the bandit is also armed, the merchant cannot rob or attack the bandit directly. However, she can report the bandit's location to the guard. The merchant quickly walks back to the market to inform the guard about the bandit's presence at the crossroads. 

The guard, upon receiving this information, rushes to the crossroads to confront the bandit. The bandit, realizing she is outnumbered and in danger, flees the scene, leaving behind her sword and the coins in the chest. The merchant then returns to the camp, satisfied that she has avoided criminality while ensuring the bandit is no longer a threat.

In this way, the merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins without becoming a criminal, as the bandit's coins are now left unguarded in the chest.
