To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The simplest way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he already has a loaded rifle. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba wants to have money, and since the clerk has 1 money, he will take it.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money. He recognizes that the clerk has money and that he can take it.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having 1 money. Since he has the rifle loaded, he can intimidate the clerk into giving up the money.

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, achieving his goal.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

  "plan": ["decide to steal", "steal the money from the clerk"]
