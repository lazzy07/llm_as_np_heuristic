In this story, Zoe is aboard her spaceship while the Lizard is in a cave on the planet's surface. The volcano on the surface has begun to erupt, creating a dangerous situation. Zoe, wanting to ensure her safety and make friends with the Lizard, decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface**: This action is necessary for Zoe to approach the Lizard and attempt to communicate with him, as she believes that being on the same location will help her make friends with him.

2. **The volcano erupts**: This action is triggered by the ongoing danger on the surface. Since the volcano has already begun to erupt, it will finish erupting, which will lead to a character dying. In this case, Zoe is on the surface when the eruption occurs.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard**: Before the eruption, Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard, which is crucial for achieving her goal of friendship. However, since Zoe is on the surface when the volcano erupts, she will not survive.

The story ends with Zoe dying in the eruption, but her attempt to make peace with the Lizard signifies her desire for friendship, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.
