**Story Completion:**

After the events that have transpired, Roy is in the gym with the bully, who is currently preoccupied with his own workout. Roy knows he needs to act quickly to secure his safety and achieve his goal of being alive and free from threats.

1. **lock_gym(Roy, Gym)**: Roy decides to lock the gym door while the bully is distracted. This action ensures that they are isolated from the rest of the prison, preventing any interference from guards or other prisoners. It also gives Roy a moment to strategize without the bully being able to escape or call for help.

2. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: With the gym door locked and the bully unable to escape, Roy takes the opportunity to confront the bully. He uses the knife he knows is in the kitchen (which he can access later) to kill the bully. This action eliminates the immediate threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing Roy to feel safe.

3. **next_day()**: The day ends, and the next day begins. This transition is necessary to signify that the events of day one have concluded and that Roy can now plan his escape.

4. **disguise(Roy, Clothes, Hall)**: Now that the bully is no longer a threat, Roy can retrieve the civilian clothes from the laundry room. He disguises himself in the civilian clothes, which will help him blend in and avoid detection when he attempts to escape.

5. **vent(Roy, Hall)**: Roy crawls through the vents to reach the hallway, which is a strategic move to avoid any guards or other prisoners who might recognize him.

6. **escape(Roy, Highway)**: Finally, Roy makes his way to the highway while wearing the civilian clothes. This action allows him to escape from the prison successfully, achieving his goal of being alive and free from threats.
