To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to steal from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba can leave the bank after stealing the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to obtain money, and the clerk has it.
- **Steal the money:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of having money.
- **Go to the house:** This action is included to conclude Bubba's journey after achieving his goal.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
