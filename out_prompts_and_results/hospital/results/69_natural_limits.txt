Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, first admits Ross to Exam Room B, where he can be treated for his fever. This increases Hathaway's workload to 1. Next, Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room B and confirms he is experiencing a fever. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, successfully curing him of Flaze and reducing the workload back to 0.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Exam Room C, where he can be treated for his rash. This increases Hathaway's workload to 1. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room C and confirms he is experiencing a rash. Hathaway then treats Young with steroids, successfully curing him of Jarkis and reducing the workload back to 0.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to check on Jones. Since Jones is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway admits him to Exam Room A. Hathaway assesses Jones and finds that he is not experiencing any symptoms of Flaze or Jarkis, confirming he is healthy. 

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
