Zoe, aboard her spaceship, realizes that the surface of the planet is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the imminent eruption of the volcano. She decides to teleport back to the surface to warn the Lizard, hoping to establish a friendship and ensure both their safety.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet to find the Lizard and warn him about the volcano. This action is necessary as it brings her closer to the Lizard, allowing for potential communication and friendship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe walks from the surface to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is essential for her to reach the Lizard and convey the urgency of the situation.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Upon reaching the cave, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it establishes a friendly relationship between them, aligning with both characters' goals of making friends.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: As they are making peace, the volcano erupts, creating a dangerous situation. This action fulfills the requirement of the volcano erupting and leads to the conclusion of the story.

In this sequence, Zoe successfully warns the Lizard, they become friends, and the volcano erupts, resulting in a dramatic but necessary conclusion.
