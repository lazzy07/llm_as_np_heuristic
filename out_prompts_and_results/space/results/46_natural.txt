Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back to the planet to confront the Lizard and establish a relationship. She teleports to the surface, where she finds the Lizard in the cave. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and address the situation on the planet, as she believes the Lizard is not the guardian and wants to change that perception.

Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the cave where the Lizard is located. The Lizard, seeing Zoe, feels threatened and prepares to defend its territory.

2. **Zoe walks to the cave.** - This action allows Zoe to reach the Lizard and initiate a conversation, which is essential for them to potentially become friends.

As they begin to communicate and understand each other, the volcano on the surface suddenly erupts, creating a dangerous situation.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting, which will lead to a character dying.

In the chaos of the eruption, the Lizard, still in the cave, is caught in the eruption and cannot escape in time.

5. **The Lizard dies.** - This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.
