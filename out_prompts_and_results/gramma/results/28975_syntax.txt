To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit moves to the Market to confront Tom, who is currently there and has a sword. This is necessary for the Bandit to attempt to rob Tom of his coin.

2. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit robs Tom of his coin. Since Tom is armed, this action is valid as the Bandit is also armed. This action directly helps the Bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

3. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit returns to the Crossroads after robbing Tom. This is necessary to move towards the Bandit Camp where she can store her coins.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action ensures that the Bandit has coins stored in her camp, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- The Bandit walks to the Market to confront Tom and rob him.
- The Bandit successfully robs Tom of his coin, increasing her own coin count.
- The Bandit walks back to the Crossroads to head towards her camp.
- Finally, the Bandit takes the coins from the chest at her camp, ensuring she has coins stored there.
