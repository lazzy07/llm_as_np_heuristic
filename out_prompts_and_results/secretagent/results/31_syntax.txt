To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must first find the gun, then move to the same location as the mastermind, and finally kill the mastermind. Here’s the completed story with explanations for each action:

1. **find(SecretAgent, Gun, Office)**: The secret agent is currently in the office and needs to find the gun to carry out the mission. This action allows the secret agent to discover the gun in the office.

2. **move(SecretAgent, Office, Lobby)**: After picking up the gun, the secret agent moves to the lobby. This is necessary to get closer to the mastermind, who is believed to be in the office.

3. **move(SecretAgent, Lobby, Courtyard)**: The secret agent moves to the courtyard. This is a required step to navigate towards the mastermind's location.

4. **move(SecretAgent, Courtyard, Dropbox)**: The secret agent continues moving towards the dropbox, which is the next step in reaching the mastermind.

5. **move(SecretAgent, Dropbox, Headquarters)**: The secret agent moves to the headquarters, which is the final location before confronting the mastermind.

6. **move(SecretAgent, Headquarters, Office)**: The secret agent finally moves back to the office where the mastermind is located.

7. **kill(SecretAgent, Mastermind, Gun, Office)**: Now that the secret agent is in the same location as the mastermind and has the gun, they can execute the action to kill the mastermind.

This sequence of actions ensures that the secret agent successfully finds the gun, navigates to the mastermind's location, and ultimately kills them, achieving the goal of the story.
