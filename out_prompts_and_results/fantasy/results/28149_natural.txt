To achieve the goal of Talia becoming happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the actions that will lead to her happiness or wealth. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but her happiness is at 0. The treasure is located in the cave, and Vince has the money. Gargax is hungry and may pose a threat to the humans.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness:

1. **Gargax eats Vince**: This action is necessary because Vince has the money, and by removing him from the equation, Talia can focus on her own happiness without the competition for wealth. Gargax, being a dragon, is motivated to eat a human to satisfy his hunger.

2. **Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body**: After Gargax eats Vince, Talia can take the money that Vince had. This action will make Talia wealthy, which is one of her goals.

3. **Talia travels to the cave**: Talia can now travel to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for her to potentially increase her wealth further.

4. **Talia picks up the treasure**: By picking up the treasure in the cave, Talia will increase her wealth even more, which can contribute to her happiness.

5. **Talia becomes happy**: With the money and treasure, Talia can now be considered wealthy, which fulfills her desire for wealth and contributes to her happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Gargax eats Vince**: Removes competition and satisfies Gargax's hunger.
- **Talia picks up the money from Vince's dead body**: Talia becomes wealthy.
- **Talia travels to the cave**: Moves to the location of the treasure.
- **Talia picks up the treasure**: Increases Talia's wealth.
- **Talia becomes happy**: Achieves her goal of happiness.
