In the cave, Talia, Rory, and Vince are all present, along with Gargax, who is feeling hungry. Talia has already proposed to Rory, and they are married, but Talia is still unhappy and has no wealth. Vince has the money, which is crucial for Talia's happiness and wealth.

To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the following actions will take place:

1. **Vince gives the money to Talia.** This action is necessary because Talia wants to be wealthy, and since Vince has the money, giving it to Talia will fulfill her desire for wealth, which will also contribute to her happiness.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** This action is important because the treasure is at the cave, and picking it up will further enhance Talia's wealth, making her even happier.

After these actions, Talia will have both the money and the treasure, achieving her goals of happiness and wealth.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Vince gives the money to Talia:** This directly addresses Talia's desire to be wealthy, which is essential for her happiness.
- **Talia picks up the treasure:** This action adds to Talia's wealth, ensuring that she is not only wealthy but also happy.
