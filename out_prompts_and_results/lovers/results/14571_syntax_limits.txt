To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently in the same room (R22) as Alex. 

Since Casey (C3) is already happy with the item they have (the jewelry), we can have Alex pick up the jewelry from the room. This action will make Alex happy.

Here’s the action that will be taken:

1. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry from the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be:

- at(C1) = R22
- at(C2) = R22
- at(C3) = R22
- at(I1) = C1 (Alex now has the jewelry)
- at(I2) = R21
- at(I3) = C3
- happy(C1) = True (Alex is now happy)
- happy(C2) = False
- happy(C3) = True

Now, Alex has achieved their goal of being happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["pick_up(C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most efficient way for Alex to achieve their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
