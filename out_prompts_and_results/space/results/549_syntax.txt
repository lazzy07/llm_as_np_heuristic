To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)** - This action has already been taken, so the volcano is in the process of erupting.
2. **erupt(Surface)** - This action will cause the volcano to erupt fully, leading to the death of any characters on the surface.
3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)** - Since both characters are in the cave and not fighting, they can make peace and become friends.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. The volcano begins to erupt, which has already been initiated.
2. The volcano erupts, killing Zoe and the Lizard, who are both on the surface.
3. Before the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard make peace in the cave, establishing a friendship.

The actions are necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts, resulting in the death of both characters, while also ensuring that they become friends before the eruption occurs.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)"
  ]
}
```

In this plan, the eruption is the critical action that leads to the characters' demise, while the peace-making action ensures that they establish a friendship before the end.
