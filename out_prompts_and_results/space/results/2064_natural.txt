To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can either become friends or that one of them dies, while also incorporating the eruption of the volcano. Given the current situation, Zoe is at the ship, and the Lizard is at the cave. They are not fighting, but they are also not friends. The Lizard believes Zoe is at the surface, which is a misunderstanding that can be addressed.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired outcome:

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary to create a situation where the Lizard can see Zoe and they can interact. It also places Zoe in a dangerous environment, which is crucial for the volcano eruption to have an impact.

2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** - This event is triggered after Zoe arrives on the surface, creating immediate danger for her.

3. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard, sensing the eruption and wanting to protect the surface, comes to the surface to confront the situation.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard see each other on the surface.** - This is a critical moment where they can choose to either fight or make peace.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.** - Instead of fighting, they decide to communicate and understand each other's intentions, leading to friendship.

6. **The volcano finishes erupting.** - This final event occurs after they have made peace, ensuring that the eruption happens but does not result in either character's death since they are now friends.

This sequence of actions leads to the characters becoming friends while also incorporating the eruption of the volcano, fulfilling the story's requirements.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Teleporting to the surface** allows Zoe to be in a position where she can interact with the Lizard.
- **The eruption** creates a sense of urgency and danger, prompting the Lizard to come to the surface.
- **Walking to the surface** allows the Lizard to confront Zoe, leading to the potential for conflict or resolution.
- **Making peace** is the key action that transforms their relationship from enemies to friends.
- **The eruption finishing** signifies the end of the immediate danger, allowing for a safe resolution.
