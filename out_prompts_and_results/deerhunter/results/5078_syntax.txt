To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is at the bank with the clerk, and he is greedy, wanting to acquire money. The clerk has money, and Bubba has a loaded rifle, which allows him to take action against the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money from him. This action is necessary because Bubba is greedy and wants to acquire money, and the clerk has it.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is necessary for Bubba to secure his stolen money in a safe location.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the clerk, fulfilling his greed and achieving his goal of obtaining money.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: This action ensures that Bubba can safely retreat to a location where he can keep the stolen money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, House)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
