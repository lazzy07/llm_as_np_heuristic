Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway. He knows that he needs to escape the prison to ensure his survival. Since he has already stolen the pack of cigarettes, he feels a sense of accomplishment, but his main goal is to get out of the prison alive. 

To achieve this, Ernest simply walks down the highway, confident in his disguise, and escapes from the prison. 

This action is included in the story because it directly fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and not threatened, while also allowing him to keep the pack of cigarettes he has stolen.
