To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomA, Hathaway can assess him to find out if he has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash). This is crucial because Hathaway needs to know the correct treatment to administer.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Hathaway finds that Jones has a fever (indicating Flaze), the next logical step is to treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

- **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway walks into PatientRoomA and assesses Jones. She discovers that he has a fever, which indicates that he has Flaze. This action is essential for Hathaway to understand the patient's condition and decide on the appropriate treatment.

- **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones and confirming he has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This treatment is effective, and as a result, Jones becomes healthy.

By performing these two actions, Hathaway successfully treats Jones, achieving her goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
