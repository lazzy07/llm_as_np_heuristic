To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going from the forest to the bank** allows Bubba to reach the location where the clerk is, which is essential for the next action of stealing.
- **Stealing the money** is the direct action that fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, which is his goal.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
