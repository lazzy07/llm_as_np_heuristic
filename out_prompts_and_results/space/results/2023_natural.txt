Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to take action to ensure both her safety and the Lizard's. She understands that the Lizard is the guardian of the surface and that they need to work together to survive the eruption. 

1. **Zoe walks from the cave to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to confront the Lizard and address the situation directly, as she believes the surface is dangerous and wants to help the Lizard.

2. **Zoe approaches the Lizard and makes peace.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can establish a friendship. This is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to make friends and ensures they can work together to escape the danger.

3. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the previous actions. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can help each other during the eruption.

4. **Zoe teleports to the ship.** - This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety as the eruption occurs. Since she is now friends with the Lizard, she can leave the surface without causing anger.

5. **The Lizard, still on the surface, is caught in the eruption and dies.** - This tragic ending occurs because the Lizard was unable to escape the eruption, highlighting the danger of the surface.

In summary, the story illustrates the importance of friendship and cooperation in the face of danger, even if it results in a tragic outcome for one character.
