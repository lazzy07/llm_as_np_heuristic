To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her happiness through marriage or wealth accumulation. Since Rory has already proposed to Talia, the next logical step is for Talia to accept the proposal, which will make both of them happy. After that, Rory can travel to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which will increase their wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal. This action makes both Talia and Rory happy, fulfilling Talia's desire for happiness.
2. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave to retrieve the treasure, which will increase their wealth.
3. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure from the cave, increasing their wealth.

Now, Talia is happy due to her marriage to Rory, and Rory has acquired the treasure, which contributes to their wealth.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: This action is crucial as it directly leads to Talia's happiness by accepting Rory's proposal.
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to go to the cave to get the treasure, which is essential for increasing their wealth.
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action allows Rory to acquire the treasure, which is necessary for achieving their goal of wealth.
