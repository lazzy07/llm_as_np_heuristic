Zoe and the Lizard are currently on the surface of the planet, where the environment is dangerous due to a volcano that has begun to erupt. They have already made peace with each other, which is a crucial step toward achieving their goals of safety and friendship. 

To ensure their safety and to solidify their friendship, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where it is safer from the volcanic activity. This action is necessary to avoid the dangers of the surface and to find a secure place to continue building their friendship.

2. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will follow Zoe into the cave. This action is important as it shows the Lizard's willingness to stay close to Zoe and reinforces their bond.

3. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Although they have already made peace, reaffirming their friendship in a safe location will help solidify their relationship. This action is crucial for both characters to feel secure and connected.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: Zoe will teleport back to the spaceship, ensuring her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary for Zoe to achieve her goal of being safe.

5. **teleport_to_ship(Lizard, Cave, Ship)**: The Lizard will also teleport to the spaceship, ensuring its safety as well. This action is important for the Lizard to achieve its goal of being safe.

By following these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.
