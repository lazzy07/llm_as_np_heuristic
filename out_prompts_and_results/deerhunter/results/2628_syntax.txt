To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to go to the bank where the money is located. This action is necessary to reach the location where he can obtain the money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he will use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary because the clerk has money, and Bubba needs to eliminate the clerk to take it without resistance.
