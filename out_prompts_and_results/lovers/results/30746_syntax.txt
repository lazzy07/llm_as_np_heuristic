To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bedroom (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate the next actions.

2. **tell(C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry (I2). This is a strategic move to mislead Alex into thinking that Casey wants the jewelry, which will prompt Alex to act in a way that helps Blake.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bedroom (R12) to the dining room (R22). Alex believes that Casey is in the dining room and wants the jewelry, so they will go there to find it.

4. **pick_up(C1, I2, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room (R22). This is crucial because Alex is now holding the item that Blake wants.

5. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake (C3) in the dining room (R22). This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to influence their actions.
- **tell(C2, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey misleads Alex into thinking they want the jewelry, prompting Alex to act.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to where they believe Casey is to find the jewelry.
- **pick_up(C1, I2, R22)**: Alex picks up the jewelry, which is necessary for the next action.
- **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Blake, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry they wanted.
