Bubba, feeling hungry after shooting Bambi, decides to eat the deer. This action satisfies his hunger and allows him to gain sustenance from the kill. Since Bambi is already dead, Bubba can eat without any further complications. After eating, Bubba feels more energized and motivated to return to the bank to confront the clerk about the money.

**Explanation of the action:**
- **Bubba eats Bambi**: This action is necessary because it satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a current need. Additionally, since Bambi is already dead, this action does not conflict with any other character's goals or actions.

After eating, Bubba can then go back to the bank to potentially confront the clerk for the money, but since the goal is to end with Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (which is already the case), the story concludes here.
