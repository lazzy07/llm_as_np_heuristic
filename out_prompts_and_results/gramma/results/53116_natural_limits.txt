The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the crossroads to the market. There, she sees the guard and the hero. The bandit knows that the guard is armed and poses a threat, so she decides to take a risk. She approaches the hero, who is distracted by the merchant's presence. The bandit swiftly robs the hero of the merchant's sword, knowing that the hero is not armed and cannot defend themselves. With the sword in hand, the bandit now has a weapon to defend herself if needed.

Next, the bandit walks back to the crossroads, where she can safely return to her camp. She takes the hero's coin from the merchant, ensuring that she has more coins in her possession. Finally, she returns to the bandit camp, where she can store her newly acquired coins in the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
