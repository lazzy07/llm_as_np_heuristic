Bubba, having just eaten Bambi, decides to go to the bank to get the money he desires. He believes that the clerk has money, and since he has a rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money.

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the clerk and attempt to get the money.
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - Since Bubba wants the money and believes the clerk has it, shooting the clerk will allow him to take the money without resistance.
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can now take the money, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully gets the money he desires while adhering to the constraints of the story.
