To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to identify Jones's condition.

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If Jones has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy. If Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis, this treatment will lead to Jones's death. However, the goal is to treat Jones based on the assessment.

3. **Assess Young in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will then assess Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment.

This sequence of actions is designed to maximize the chances of treating the patients correctly while keeping the story concise.
