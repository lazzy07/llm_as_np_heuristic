Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room A, decides to assess Ross, who is experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is 2, they can accurately assess Ross without the risk of making a mistake. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. This action is necessary to identify Ross's condition accurately.

2. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: After identifying Ross's condition, Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This action is crucial for ensuring Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Walk from Patient Room A to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Admissions to assess and admit Young, who is still waiting. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to and to maintain the flow of care in the hospital.
