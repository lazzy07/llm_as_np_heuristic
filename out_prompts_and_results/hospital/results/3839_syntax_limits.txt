To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway will admit Ross to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross can be assessed and treated next.

4. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This will allow Hathaway to identify the correct treatment for Ross.
