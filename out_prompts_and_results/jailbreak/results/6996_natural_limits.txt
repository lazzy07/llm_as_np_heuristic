On day one, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, is in the hallway. He knows that Ernest is in the gym, threatened by the bully. To help his friend and ensure their survival, Roy decides to take action. He crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where Ernest is being threatened by the bully.

Once in the gym, Roy sees the bully looming over Ernest. With the element of surprise on his side, Roy pulls out the knife he had previously hidden in the kitchen. In a swift motion, he confronts the bully and kills him, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
