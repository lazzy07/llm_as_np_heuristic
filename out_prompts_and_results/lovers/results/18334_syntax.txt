To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that Casey (C3) has the jewelry in the bathroom (R12). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom to retrieve the jewelry. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Blake.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, making Blake happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Blake moves back to the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Blake's happiness but helps to maintain the flow of the story.

After these actions, Blake will have the jewelry, making them happy. 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the bathroom to access the jewelry.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: This is the key action that fulfills Blake's desire for the jewelry, thus making Blake happy.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: While this does not affect the happiness of Blake, it allows for a logical progression of the story.
