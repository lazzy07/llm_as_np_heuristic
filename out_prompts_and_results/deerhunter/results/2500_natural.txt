To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.

2. **Bubba shoots the bank clerk with the rifle.**  
   - Since Bubba wants to have money, shooting the bank clerk will allow him to steal the money the clerk has.

3. **Bubba steals the money from the bank clerk.**  
   - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money directly from him, fulfilling his goal of having money.

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead from the earlier events.
