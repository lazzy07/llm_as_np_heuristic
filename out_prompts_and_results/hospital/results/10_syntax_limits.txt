In this story, we will focus on the actions of Dr. Hathaway as she assesses and treats the patients. The goal is to ensure that at least one patient becomes healthy or dies based on the symptoms and treatments available.

1. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Exam Room A, where she can assess him later. This increases her workload to 1.
   
2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room B, allowing her to assess him as well. This increases her workload to 2.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Exam Room A. She sees that Young has a rash, which indicates Jarkis. She believes Young has Jarkis.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Exam Room A. She sees that Jones has a symptom (fever) but mistakenly believes he has Jarkis due to her workload being 2. 

5. **Treat Young with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids for Jarkis. Since Young actually has Jarkis, he becomes healthy. This reduces her workload to 1.

6. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing he has Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, he dies. This reduces her workload to 0.
