Tom is at the Market, armed with the MerchantSword. He knows that the Merchant has the medicine he needs to carry back to the cottage. However, the Bandit is also at the Market and has just robbed the Merchant of Tom's coin. To achieve his goal of getting the medicine, Tom decides to take action against the Bandit.

1. **Action: attack(Tom, Bandit, Market)** - Tom attacks the Bandit, who is armed but is not expecting an attack from Tom. Since Tom is armed with the MerchantSword and the Bandit is also armed, this action is risky but necessary for Tom to retrieve his coin and the medicine.

After successfully attacking the Bandit, Tom loots the Bandit's corpse.

2. **Action: loot(Tom, Medicine, Bandit, Market)** - Tom loots the medicine from the Bandit, ensuring he has what he needs to return to the cottage.

With the medicine in hand, Tom can now walk back to the cottage.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is crucial as it allows Tom to eliminate the Bandit, who poses a threat to his goal of obtaining the medicine.
- The second action is necessary for Tom to actually acquire the medicine after defeating the Bandit.
