To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Zoe walks from the Surface to the Cave.** This action is necessary for Zoe to find a safe place away from the erupting volcano and to explore the cave, which may provide a better environment for friendship with the Lizard.

2. **Zoe walks from the Cave to the Surface.** Zoe needs to return to the surface to interact with the Lizard again, as they are currently in the same location.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard on the Surface.** This action is crucial for solidifying their friendship. Since they are not fighting, they can become friends, which aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the Cave.** This action allows both characters to find safety from the erupting volcano while also fostering their friendship in a secure environment.

5. **The volcano erupts.** This event is included to show the danger of the surface and the necessity of having moved to the cave for safety.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
