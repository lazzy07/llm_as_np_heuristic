To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms. Similar to Ross, this is necessary for the same reason.

3. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is in the admissions room, Hathaway needs to assess him to understand his condition.

4. **Treat Ross with the correct treatment**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

5. **Treat Young with the correct treatment**: Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This is also crucial for Young's recovery.

6. **Treat Jones with the correct treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment for his disease. This is essential for Jones's recovery.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing each patient**: This is necessary to identify the symptoms and determine the correct treatment for each patient. Without this step, Hathaway cannot provide the right care.
- **Treating each patient**: Once Hathaway knows the symptoms, treating each patient with the correct treatment is essential to ensure they recover and are healthy.
