1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms, even though she is confused about his location.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway administers the treatment based on her incorrect assumption. However, since Jones is actually healthy and not experiencing any symptoms, he survives the treatment.
