To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they receive the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, hereâ€™s a concise story that leads to that outcome:

1. **Action: move(C2, R12, R21)** - Casey (C2) moves from the dining room (R12) to the living room (R21) where Alex (C1) and Blake (C3) are located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with the other characters and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **Action: tell(C1, C2, I3, R21)** - Alex (C1) tells Casey (C2) that they want the jewelry (I3) while in the living room (R21). This is a lie, as Alex actually wants the flowers (I1). However, this action is crucial because it misleads Casey into thinking that Alex wants the jewelry, which can prompt a trade or gift.

3. **Action: trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)** - Blake (C3) trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Casey (C2) has. This action is essential because it allows Casey to receive the jewelry they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

4. **Action: move(C2, R21, R12)** - Casey (C2) moves back to the dining room (R12) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to conclude the story with Casey in a different location.

After these actions, Casey will be happy because they now possess the jewelry (I3) that they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
