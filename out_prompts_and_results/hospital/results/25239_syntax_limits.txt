**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, Fever, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing is necessary to identify if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, Antibiotics, PatientRoomB**: After assessing, Hathaway believes Jones has a fever, which indicates Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Rash, PatientRoomA**: Hathaway then walks to PatientRoomA to assess Young. Since Young is in PatientRoomA, Hathaway can determine if Young has a rash, which would indicate Jarkis.

4. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomA**: After assessing Young and confirming he has a rash, Hathaway treats him with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, ensuring that Young also becomes healthy.
