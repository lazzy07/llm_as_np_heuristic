As the first day in the prison comes to a close, Roy, locked in the gym with the bully, realizes he needs to act quickly. He knows that Ernest is in the laundry room and has the cigarettes, which the bully wants. To protect both himself and Ernest, Roy decides to take a bold step. 

Roy uses the knife he found in the kitchen earlier to kill the bully. With the bully out of the way, Roy can now escape the gym. He unlocks the door and rushes to find Ernest. 

Once outside the gym, Roy heads to the laundry room, where he finds Ernest. Together, they make their way to the hallway. Roy quickly puts on the civilian clothes he had stolen earlier, disguising himself.
