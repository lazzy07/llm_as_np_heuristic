To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items available. Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, which means they can get married. However, Talia also needs to acquire wealth, which she can do by taking the treasure from Rory. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's goal:

1. **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: Talia takes the treasure from Rory. This action is necessary for Talia to become wealthy, as she currently has no wealth.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: After taking the treasure, Talia can marry Rory. Since she has accepted his proposal, this action will make both of them happy.

Now, Talia has both happiness (from marrying Rory) and wealth (from taking the treasure), thus achieving her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **take(Talia, Treasure, Rory, Cave)**: This action allows Talia to gain the treasure, which is essential for her to become wealthy.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: This action fulfills Talia's need for happiness through marriage, as she has already accepted Rory's proposal.
