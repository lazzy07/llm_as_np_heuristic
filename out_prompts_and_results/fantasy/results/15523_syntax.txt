To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on the actions that lead to her accepting Rory's marriage proposal, which will make her happy. Since Talia is currently in the Cave and Rory has proposed to her, the next logical step is for Talia to accept the proposal. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Cave)**: Talia accepts Rory's marriage proposal. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her primary goals.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Cave)**: After Talia accepts the proposal, they get married. This solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

At this point, Talia is happy due to her marriage to Rory. Since her goal of becoming happy is achieved, we do not need to pursue wealth for her in this scenario.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, as she needs to accept Rory's proposal to move forward in their relationship.
- **marry**: This action finalizes their relationship, ensuring Talia's happiness as a result of their union.
