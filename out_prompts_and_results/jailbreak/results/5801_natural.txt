**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he must act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He knows the bully is in the gym, and he has the cigarettes that the bully wants. 

1. **Roy moves to the gym.** (This action is necessary for Roy to confront the bully and protect Ernest.)

3. **Roy confronts the bully.** (This action is implied as part of the confrontation that follows.)
4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This is the critical action that ensures both Roy and Ernest are no longer threatened by the bully.)
5. **Roy escapes through the hallway to the highway.** (After dealing with the bully, Roy needs to leave the prison to achieve his goal of being alive and free.)
6. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself.** (This action is necessary for Roy to successfully escape without being recognized.)
