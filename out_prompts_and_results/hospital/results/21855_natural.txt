**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, this treatment is a gamble. However, it is the only option available to Hathaway at this moment.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway's workload reduces to 1. Jones, after receiving the treatment, becomes healthy, as he was indeed suffering from Flaze.

Now, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess the other patients, Ross and Young, who are still waiting there. 

Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B, increasing the workload back to 2. Then, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics as well, believing he might have Flaze. 

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway's workload reduces to 1 again, and Ross becomes healthy.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room A. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A, and since Young is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Young also becomes healthy after the treatment.

At the end of these actions, all patients are healthy, and Dr. Hathaway has achieved their goal.
