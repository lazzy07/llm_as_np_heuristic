The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the crossroads to the market. Upon arriving, she sees the merchant and the hero. The bandit decides to attack the hero, who is carrying the merchant's sword but is not aware of the bandit's presence. The bandit successfully kills the hero, loots the hero's coin, and now has both her own coins in the chest and the hero's coin.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Bandit walks from the crossroads to the market**: This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the hero and merchant, as she needs to be at the market to achieve her goal of acquiring coins.
2. **Bandit attacks the hero**: The bandit attacks because the hero is a criminal and is carrying a coin, which aligns with the bandit's goal of acquiring as many coins as possible.
3. **Bandit loots the hero's coin**: After killing the hero, the bandit takes the hero's coin, which adds to her collection of coins.

The bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as she can.
