**Story Completion:**

On day one, Roy, having completed his chores in the kitchen, decides to take action. He knows that Ernest is in the gym and is being threatened by the bully. Roy has the knife and the civilian clothes, which he plans to use to help both himself and Ernest.

Roy moves from the kitchen to the hallway. He then crawls through the vents to reach the gym, where he finds Ernest still under threat from the bully. 

Seeing the bully distracted, Roy takes out the knife and kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer threatened. With the bully out of the way, Roy and Ernest can now escape together. 

Roy then puts on the civilian clothes to disguise himself. They both move to the hallway, where they can escape to the highway.
