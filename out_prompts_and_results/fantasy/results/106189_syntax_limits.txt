In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to secure the treasure that is located in the cave, as it will make him wealthy. Since Talia has already proposed to him and he accepted, they are happy together, which fulfills part of his goal. 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Rory to access the treasure, which is essential for him to become wealthy.

2. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

After these actions, Rory will be happy (due to his relationship with Talia), wealthy (after picking up the treasure), and not hungry (as he has not become hungry during the story). 

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Rory achieves his goal efficiently and effectively.
