To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to fulfill his goal of being there with the medicine.

This is the only action needed for Tom to achieve his goal, as he already possesses the medicine and is armed, which means he can safely walk to the Cottage without any threat.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action allows Tom to move directly to the Cottage, where he will be carrying the medicine. Since there are no threats or obstacles in this action, it is the most efficient way for Tom to achieve his goal.
