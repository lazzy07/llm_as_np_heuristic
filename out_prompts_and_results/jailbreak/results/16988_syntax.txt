**Story Completion:**

After stealing the civilian clothes from the laundry, Roy successfully disguises himself while on the highway. He knows that Ernest is still in the cell block and is threatened by the bully. To ensure his own safety and to help Ernest, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Action: go(Roy, Hall)** - Roy moves from the highway to the hallway to get closer to the gym where the bully is located. This is necessary for him to take further action against the bully.

2. **Action: lock_gym(Roy, Hall)** - Roy locks the gym door from the hallway. This prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without the risk of being threatened or attacked. 

3. **Action: vent(Roy, Gym)** - Roy crawls through the vents to enter the gym. This allows him to confront the bully directly without being seen by the guards or other prisoners.

4. **Action: kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)** - With the knife he knows is in the kitchen, Roy kills the bully in the gym. This action eliminates the threat to both himself and Ernest, allowing them both to be safe.

5. **Action: next_day()** - The day ends, and it is now day two. 

6. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)** - Now that the bully is no longer a threat, Roy can safely escape from the prison while still disguised in civilian clothes.
