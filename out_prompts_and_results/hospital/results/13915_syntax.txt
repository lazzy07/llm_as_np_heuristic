To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Since Hathaway is currently in Exam Room A and Ross is assigned there, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway can walk to Exam Room B to assess Jones. This is important to determine Jones's symptoms as well.

3. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway can walk to Exam Room C to assess Young. This ensures that all patients are evaluated for their symptoms.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Jones**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Jones based on his assessment. This is necessary to ensure Jones also becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Young based on his assessment. This completes the treatment for all patients.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
