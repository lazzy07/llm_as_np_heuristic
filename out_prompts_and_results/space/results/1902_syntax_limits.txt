In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet. The volcano on the surface has already begun to erupt, making the surface uninhabitable. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard, who is the guardian of the planet. 

Since they are both in the cave and not fighting, Zoe can take the opportunity to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial because it aligns with both characters' goals of wanting to be friends and safe. By making peace, they can establish a friendly relationship, which is essential for their mutual safety and well-being.
