**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A. Since Jones is experiencing Fever, Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies that he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, which successfully makes Jones healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to the admissions room to admit Ross to Patient Room B. Ross, who is also experiencing Fever, is assigned to Patient Room B. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B and identifies that he has Flaze as well. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, making him healthy too.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young is experiencing Rash, so Dr. Hathaway assigns him to Patient Room C. Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C and mistakenly believes he has Flaze due to his workload increasing to three. Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, which is incorrect, and unfortunately, Young dies.
