To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The Bandit leaves the Market for the Camp, which removes the immediate threat to the Merchant and allows her to operate without fear of being attacked.

2. **buy(Merchant, TomCoin, 1, Camp)**: The Merchant uses one of the coins she has to buy Tom's coin from the Merchant. This action increases her coin count while keeping her actions legal.

3. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant moves to the Crossroads, preparing to return to the Market.

4. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant returns to the Market, where she can continue her business.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired a coin without engaging in criminal activity, thus achieving her goal.
