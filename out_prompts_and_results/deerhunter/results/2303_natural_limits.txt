Bubba, now at the bank, sees the clerk with the money he desires. He is still hungry but knows that getting the money is his priority. Since he has the rifle loaded with ammunition, he decides to take action.

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can intimidate the clerk into giving him the money without needing to shoot. This action directly helps Bubba achieve his goal of having money.

2. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** This final action ensures that Bubba now has the money he wanted, fulfilling his goal.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is already dead, which satisfies the conditions of the story.

- **Decide to steal the money from the clerk:** This action is necessary because Bubba wants to obtain money, and he has the means (the loaded rifle) to intimidate the clerk into compliance.
