To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Hathaway is in PatientRoomB with Ross, the first action is to assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial because understanding Ross's symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics. If he has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids. This action is necessary to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Next, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Young. This is important because Young is also a patient who needs to be evaluated for symptoms.

4. **Treat Young**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. This will ensure that Young also becomes healthy.
