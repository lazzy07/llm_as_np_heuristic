In this story, Talia's goal is to become happy or wealthy. Since she is already married to Rory, who also desires happiness and wealth, they can work together to achieve their goals. The quickest way for Talia to become wealthy is for Gargax, who is at the village and believes Vince has the money, to take the money from Vince's body. Gargax, being a dragon, is not concerned about happiness but is motivated by wealth. 

Here’s the completed story:

Final explanation:
- Gargax takes the money from Vince, fulfilling his desire for wealth. This action indirectly supports Talia's goal of becoming wealthy, as she is married to Rory, who can benefit from Gargax's newfound wealth.
