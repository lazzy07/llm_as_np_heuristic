Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis. However, Hathaway knows that Jones is experiencing Fever and therefore has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room B with antibiotics, successfully making him healthy. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young, who is experiencing Rash. Hathaway assigns Young to Patient Room C and then treats him with steroids, successfully making him healthy as well. 

In this way, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
