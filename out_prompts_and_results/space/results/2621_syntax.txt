To complete the story, we will have Zoe and the Lizard work towards making peace while the volcano is about to erupt. The goal is to ensure that the volcano erupts, which will lead to a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano starts to erupt, creating a sense of urgency and danger. This action is necessary to set the stage for the eruption that will lead to a character's death.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to put aside their differences and become friends. This action is crucial as it fulfills their goal of making friends with each other.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, which will lead to the death of one of the characters. Since both characters are currently in the cave, they are safe from the eruption, but the eruption signifies the danger of the surface.

4. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard, being the guardian of the planet, is affected by the eruption and dies. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption.

The final story sequence ensures that the volcano erupts, resulting in the Lizard's death, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **begin_erupt(Surface)**: Initiates the volcanic eruption, creating a dangerous situation.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Establishes friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, fulfilling their goal of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: Represents the culmination of the volcanic activity, leading to the consequences of the eruption.
- **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: Concludes the story with the Lizard's death due to the eruption.
