To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to fulfill his goal. This action moves him directly to his desired location.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit, who is currently at the Crossroads, will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to remove the Bandit from the Crossroads, ensuring that Tom can safely reach the Cottage without encountering any threats.

With these two actions, Tom successfully reaches the Cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it directly moves Tom to the Cottage, where he wants to be with the medicine.
- **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit is not at the Crossroads when Tom arrives at the Cottage, allowing Tom to achieve his goal without any conflict.
