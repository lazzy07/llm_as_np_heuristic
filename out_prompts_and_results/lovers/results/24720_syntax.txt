To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R22) where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers from the dining room. This action is essential as it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but is included to show movement back to a common area where other characters might be.

4. **give(C1, I1, C3, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy, as Casey wants the jewelry (I3) which Alex currently has.

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R22) to get the jewelry. This action is included to show Casey's desire to achieve their own happiness.

6. **pick_up(C3, I3, R22)**: Casey picks up the jewelry from the dining room. This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

7. **give(C3, I3, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Blake. This action ensures that Blake is also happy, as Blake wants the chocolates (I2).

8. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room (R12) to be with Alex and Casey. This action is included to show the social aspect of their relationships.

9. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Blake picks up the chocolates from the living room. This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness.

Now, all characters are happy because they have received the items they wanted.
