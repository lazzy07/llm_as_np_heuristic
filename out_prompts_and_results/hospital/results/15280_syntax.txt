To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young in Exam Room B to determine his symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones in the Admissions room to determine his symptoms. This is crucial as Jones is the last patient to be assessed.

4. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment results, Hathaway will treat Ross with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This action is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Treat Young**: Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment results. This is necessary to ensure Young becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Jones**: Lastly, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment results. This is crucial to ensure Jones becomes healthy.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients correctly, ensuring they all become healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
