Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the ongoing eruptions. To ensure their safety and health, they decide to take action together.

1. **Zoe teleports from the surface to the spaceship.**  
   - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the erupting surface. Since she is not safe on the surface, teleporting to the spaceship is the best option for her health and safety.

2. **The Lizard walks from the surface to the cave.**  
   - The Lizard also needs to find a safe place away from the eruptions. Walking to the cave is a logical choice, as it is a safer location on the planet.

3. **Zoe teleports from the spaceship to the cave.**  
   - After ensuring her safety, Zoe teleports to the cave to join the Lizard. This action is important for maintaining their friendship and ensuring they can support each other in a safe environment.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace.**  
   - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace solidifies their bond and ensures they can work together to face any future challenges.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also fostering their friendship.
