To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients in the exam rooms. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, they risk making a mistake if they assess or treat more than one patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to assess and treat one patient at a time.
