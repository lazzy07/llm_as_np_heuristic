1. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia has already proposed to Rory, and Rory has accepted her proposal. By marrying Rory, Talia will achieve happiness (as marriage makes both characters happy) and she will also retain her treasure, which contributes to her wealth. 

This action is the only one needed to fulfill Talia's goals, as it directly leads to her happiness and maintains her wealth.
