In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Currently, Alex is happy because they have the item they want (I1), but Casey is not happy because they do not have the item they want (I2). Blake can help Casey become happy by giving them the item they want.

**Story Completion:**

1. **give(Blake, I2, Casey, R22)**: Blake gives the item I2 (chocolates) to Casey in the dining room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly addresses Casey's desire for the item they want, which will make Casey happy. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy and Alex is already happy, Blake's goal is achieved by ensuring Casey is also happy.

**Explanation of the Action:**
- The action of giving chocolates to Casey is the only necessary action to ensure that both Blake and Casey achieve happiness. By giving the item that Casey wants, Blake fulfills their goal of making Alex happy indirectly, as Alex's happiness is tied to Casey's happiness.
