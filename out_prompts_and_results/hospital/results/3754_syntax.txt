To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given the current situation, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Young. This is important to ensure that Young's condition is also evaluated and treated appropriately.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the correct treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial for Ross's recovery.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that Young also receives the necessary care.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that both Ross and Young are treated correctly, leading to their recovery and achieving the goal of having all patients healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is the first step in diagnosing and treating him.

2. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: Hathaway walks to Admissions to assess Young. This is necessary to ensure that all patients are evaluated.

3. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, Admissions)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for providing the right treatment.

4. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment_for_symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross based on the assessment. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment_for_symptom, Admissions)**: Hathaway treats Young based on the assessment. This ensures that Young is also healthy.

Now, here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
