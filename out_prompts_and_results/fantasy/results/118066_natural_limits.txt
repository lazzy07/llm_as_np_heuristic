In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are present. Talia has just proposed to Rory, but she is still unhappy despite being married to both Rory and Vince. To achieve her goal of happiness and wealth, Talia decides to take the treasure she picked up and offer it to Gargax in exchange for his wealth.

**Action: Talia gives the treasure to Gargax.**

This action is necessary because Talia wants to be wealthy, and by giving the treasure to Gargax, she can negotiate for wealth in return. Gargax, who desires wealth and is not concerned about happiness, will likely agree to this exchange, thus fulfilling Talia's goal of becoming wealthy and, in turn, happy.

After this action, Talia's wealth increases, and since she has achieved her goal of being wealthy, her happiness will also increase as a result.

**Final Story:**
Talia gives the treasure to Gargax in exchange for wealth. Talia's wealth increases, and she feels happy.
