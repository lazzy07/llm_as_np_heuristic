In the current situation, Casey wants the jewelry (I3) to be happy, and they are currently not happy. Alex has the jewelry, but they are not happy either. Blake has the chocolates (I2) and is also not happy. 

To achieve Casey's goal of happiness, the simplest action is for Casey to trade with Alex. Since Alex has the jewelry that Casey wants, they can trade the item they have (the flowers, I1) for the jewelry. This action will make Casey happy, as they will receive the item they desire.

Here’s the action that will complete the story:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R21)**: Casey trades the flowers (I1) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Alex has. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Casey obtaining the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Casey will be happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers (I1).
- Blake will still be unhappy because they have the chocolates (I2), but the goal of Casey's happiness is achieved.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R21)"]
}
