To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The current situation indicates that I2 is not yet in anyone's possession, and we need to facilitate a series of actions that will lead to Blake obtaining the chocolates.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12). This action is necessary for Casey to access the chocolates, which are believed to be in the bathroom.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom. This is essential because Casey needs to have the chocolates to give them to Blake.

3. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves from the bathroom (R12) to the living room (R21). This action is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to give them the chocolates.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake (C2) in the living room (R21). This is the final action that allows Blake to receive the item they want, making Blake happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Blake has the chocolates (I2), which means Blake is happy.
- Casey has given away the chocolates, which aligns with Casey's desire to make Blake happy.
