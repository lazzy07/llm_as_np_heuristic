To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake wants the chocolates, and they are located in the dining room.

2. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to change locations, as they may want to interact with Alex or Casey in the living room.

3. **Blake gives the chocolates to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Alex is currently unhappy and wants the jewelry. By giving the chocolates to Alex, Blake can help Alex achieve happiness, which is also a goal for Blake.

4. **Alex moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake and to receive the chocolates.

5. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to return to the dining room, where they can reassess the situation and ensure they are in a position to achieve their own happiness.

6. **Blake picks up the jewelry from Casey in the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake wants to ensure they have the jewelry, which is currently with Casey.

7. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey in the dining room.**
