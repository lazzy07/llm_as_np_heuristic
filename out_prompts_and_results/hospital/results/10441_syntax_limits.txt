### Story Completion

After admitting Jones to both PatientRoomA and PatientRoomB, Hathaway decides to assess Jones in PatientRoomA first, as it is the room where Jones is currently located. 

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but Hathaway is determined to help Jones. 

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing, Hathaway believes that Jones has Flaze (due to the fever symptom) and treats him with antibiotics. This is the correct treatment for Flaze, and Jones becomes healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Hathaway then walks to the admissions room to assess Ross, who is still waiting there.

4. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: Hathaway admits Ross to PatientRoomB, where he can be treated.

5. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. 

6. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: After assessing, Hathaway believes that Ross has Jarkis (due to the rash symptom) and treats him with steroids. This is the correct treatment for Jarkis, and Ross becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway successfully treats both patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
