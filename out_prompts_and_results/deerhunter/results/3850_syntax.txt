To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba is already at the bank and has a loaded rifle, he can use it to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba shoots the bank clerk to eliminate any resistance and ensure he can take the money without opposition. This action is necessary because the clerk is the only obstacle to Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

2. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is taken to remove the threat posed by the bank clerk, allowing Bubba to take the money without any risk of being stopped.
- **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: This action is taken to fulfill Bubba's goal of acquiring money, which he has decided he wants.
