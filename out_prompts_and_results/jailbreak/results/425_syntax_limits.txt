**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Roy decides to take a risk. He knows that Ernest is in the cell block and that the bully is in the gym, but he also knows that he needs to help his friend and secure their safety. 

1. **Action: Go (Roy, Hall)** - Roy moves from the laundry room to the hallway. This action is necessary for him to access the gym where the bully is located and to potentially help Ernest.

2. **Action: Lock_gym (Roy, Hall)** - Once in the hallway, Roy locks the gym door. This prevents the bully from leaving the gym and ensures that he cannot threaten either Roy or Ernest while they plan their next move.

3. **Action: Next_day()** - The day ends, and the next day begins. This is crucial as it allows Roy to regroup and prepare for the next steps without immediate threats from the bully.

With the gym locked, Roy has effectively neutralized the bully's ability to threaten them, allowing both him and Ernest to feel safer. 

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Go (Roy, Hall)**: This action is essential for Roy to transition from a safe area (laundry) to a strategic position (hallway) where he can control access to the bully.
- **Lock_gym (Roy, Hall)**: By locking the gym, Roy ensures that the bully cannot come after them, thus protecting both himself and Ernest from immediate danger.
- **Next_day()**: This action signifies the end of the first day and the beginning of a new opportunity for Roy and Ernest to plan their escape or further actions without the bully's interference.
