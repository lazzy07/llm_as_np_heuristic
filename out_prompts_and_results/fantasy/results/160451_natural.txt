To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure located in the cave. Since Talia and Rory are at the cave and Gargax is also there, Gargax can take the treasure without any resistance. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax picks up the treasure.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to become wealthy, as the treasure is located in the cave where Gargax is present.

2. **Gargax eats Talia.**  
   - Gargax is still hungry after picking up the treasure. Eating Talia will satisfy Gargax's hunger, as Talia is present in the cave.

After these actions, Gargax will have achieved both of their goals: they will be wealthy from the treasure and not hungry after eating Talia.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Pick up the treasure:** This is essential for Gargax to achieve wealth, which is one of their primary goals.
