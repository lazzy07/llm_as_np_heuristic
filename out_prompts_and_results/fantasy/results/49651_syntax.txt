To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationship with Vince, who has proposed to her. Since Talia is currently in the Cave with Vince and Rory, we can have Talia accept Vince's proposal, leading to their marriage, which will make Talia happy. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal. This action is crucial because it directly leads to Talia's happiness, which is one of her goals.

2. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia and Vince get married. This action solidifies their relationship and ensures Talia's happiness.

3. **pickup(Talia, Treasure, Cave)**: After the marriage, Talia can pick up the treasure in the cave. This action helps Talia become wealthy, fulfilling another of her goals.

The story concludes with Talia being both happy (due to her marriage) and wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure).
