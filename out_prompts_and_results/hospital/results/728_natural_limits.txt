Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, first assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway cannot accurately diagnose him. However, Hathaway's workload is still low enough to avoid mistakes. Next, Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C, where Young is experiencing a rash. Hathaway then assesses Young and correctly identifies the rash as a symptom of Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, successfully making Young healthy. 

After treating Young, Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to assess Ross again. With the knowledge that Ross is still experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway decides to treat Ross with antibiotics, mistakenly believing he has Flaze. Unfortunately, this treatment is incorrect, and Ross does not survive. 

Despite the unfortunate outcome for Ross, Hathaway has successfully treated Young, achieving the goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
