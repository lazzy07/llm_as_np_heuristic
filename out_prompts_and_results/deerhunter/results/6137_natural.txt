To achieve Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Bubba goes from the bank to the forest.**  
   - This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi, who is in the forest. Bubba needs to find a way to get money, and Bambi could be a potential source of food, which might help Bubba's hunger.

2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.**  
   - Bubba has a loaded rifle and is hungry. Shooting Bambi will provide Bubba with food, which is essential for survival. This action is also a means to fulfill Bubba's immediate need.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.**  
   - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat the deer. This action will satisfy Bubba's hunger, allowing him to focus on his goal of obtaining money afterward.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.**  
   - After eating, Bubba returns to the bank, where the clerk is located. Bubba needs to confront the clerk to obtain the money.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.**  
   - With the rifle loaded, Bubba can intimidate the clerk into giving up the money. This action directly achieves Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money.

The sequence of actions ensures that Bubba satisfies his hunger first, which is crucial for his survival, and then successfully steals the money from the clerk.
