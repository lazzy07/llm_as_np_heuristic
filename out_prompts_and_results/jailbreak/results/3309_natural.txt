**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Roy is still in the laundry room with the cigarettes, but he must act quickly to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **Ernest moves from the highway to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Ernest to get closer to the gym where he can lock the bully out.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (By locking the gym door, Ernest ensures that the bully cannot access him or Roy, reducing the threat to both of them.)
3. **Ernest crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows Ernest to return to the highway safely, maintaining his disguise.)
4. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (Ernest is already disguised, but this action reinforces his readiness to escape.)
5. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise and the gym locked, Ernest successfully escapes, achieving his goal of staying alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the hallway allows Ernest to control the situation by locking the bully out of the gym.
- Locking the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from threatening or attacking either Ernest or Roy.
- Crawling through the vents to the highway ensures that Ernest can safely navigate back to the escape route.
- Putting on the civilian clothes is a redundant action since he is already disguised, but it emphasizes his readiness to escape.
- Escaping from the prison is the final action that fulfills Ernest's goal of being alive and free.
