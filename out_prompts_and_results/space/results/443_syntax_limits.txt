Zoe stands on the surface of the planet, aware of the danger posed by the erupting volcano. She sees the Lizard nearby and realizes that they both want to be healthy and safe. Instead of fighting, she decides to approach the Lizard with the intention of making peace.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goals of health and safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses both characters' objectives and establishes a positive relationship.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe suggests they move to the cave for safety, away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure both characters remain safe from the volcanic eruption.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard agrees and follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces their newfound friendship and ensures both characters are safe from the danger outside.

By making peace and moving to the cave, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also forming a friendship.
