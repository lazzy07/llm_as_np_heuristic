To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: The Bandit will loot the coins from Tom's corpse. This action is necessary because it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without needing to go to the chest at the camp, thus directly increasing her wealth.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has the maximum amount of coins possible, fulfilling her goal.

The Bandit successfully achieves her goal by looting Tom's coins and taking the coins from the chest, ensuring she has the most coins in her possession.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)",
    "take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)"
  ]
}
``` 

### Explanation of Actions:
- **loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Market)**: This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain coins from Tom, who is now dead. The Bandit needs to increase her coin count, and looting Tom is the quickest way to do so.
  
- **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: This action ensures that the Bandit maximizes her coin collection by retrieving the coins stored in the chest at the bandit camp. This fulfills her goal of having as many coins as possible.
