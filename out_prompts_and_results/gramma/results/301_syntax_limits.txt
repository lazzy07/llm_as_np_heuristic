**Story Completion:**

After the bandit successfully attacked the merchant and looted the medicine, she decided to take advantage of the chaos in the market. Knowing that the guard was present and likely to be on high alert, she quickly formulated a plan to secure her coins.

1. **Action: rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**  
   The bandit, armed with her sword, approached Tom, who was unaware of the danger. She robbed him of the coin he was carrying. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to increase her coin count without drawing the guard's attention.

2. **Action: take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**  
   With the coin from Tom, the bandit now had enough to return to her camp. She walked back to the bandit camp and took the coins from the chest, achieving her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action of robbing Tom is necessary for the bandit to increase her wealth without engaging in a more dangerous confrontation with the guard.
- The second action of taking the coins from the chest at the camp ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin count, fulfilling her goal.
