To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they want (I2), the following action is necessary:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R21)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is crucial because it allows Casey to obtain the item they desire, which is the chocolates, thus making Casey happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is happy with the jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) is happy with the flowers (I3).
- Casey (C3) is now happy with the chocolates (I2).

This single action effectively resolves the story by ensuring that all characters achieve their happiness.
