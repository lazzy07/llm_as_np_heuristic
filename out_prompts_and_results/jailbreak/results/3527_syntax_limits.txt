**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the laundry, Ernest is still in the laundry room, while Roy is in the hallway with the stolen knife and the pack of cigarettes. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, Roy decides to take action. 

Roy locks the gym door while the bully is inside, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. This action is crucial because it prevents the bully from retaliating against Roy and Ernest. 

Next, Roy uses the knife he stole from the kitchen to confront the bully. With the gym door locked, Roy can safely get revenge on the bully without the risk of being threatened or killed. He kills the bully, ensuring that both he and Ernest are no longer in danger.

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to Ernest and share the pack of cigarettes, fulfilling both of their desires to be alive and not threatened.
