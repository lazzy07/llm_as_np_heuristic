In the current situation, Casey (C3) is unhappy because they want the item I3 (chocolates), which is currently in the living room (R22). Alex (C1) is happy because they have the item I1 (jewelry), but Blake (C2) is unhappy because they want the item I2 (flowers), which is in the dining room (R21).

To help Casey achieve their goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **give(C2, I3, C3, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Casey in the living room (R22). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the chocolates, making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) remains happy with their jewelry (I1).
- Blake (C2) is now unhappy because they have given away the chocolates (I3) and still want the flowers (I2).
- Casey (C3) becomes happy because they now have the chocolates (I3).

This single action is sufficient to achieve Casey's goal of happiness.
