In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. She is already married to Vince, which gives her some happiness, and she possesses money, which contributes to her wealth. However, she does not have treasure yet, which is also a part of her goal for wealth. 

To achieve her goal, Talia needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave. Since Rory is currently in the cave and has no money or treasure, he is not a threat to Talia's plans. Gargax, the dragon, is also in the village, but he is not a concern for Talia as long as she stays away from him.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that Talia will take:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Talia travels to the cave to acquire the treasure. This action is necessary for her to reach the treasure, which is essential for her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have both money and treasure, making her wealthy and thus achieving her goal of happiness and wealth.
