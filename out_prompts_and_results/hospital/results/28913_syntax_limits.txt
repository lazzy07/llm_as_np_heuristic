**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, the doctor, is currently in Patient Room B with Ross, who is showing symptoms of SymptomA. Hathaway knows that SymptomA corresponds to Flaze, which requires antibiotics for treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently at 2, they can safely treat Ross without making a mistake.
