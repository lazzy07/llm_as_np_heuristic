Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. Dr. Hathaway's workload increases to 3, but this is manageable for the next action.

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: By assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the assumption that he might have one of the two diseases.

3. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics.**  
   - Explanation: Since Dr. Hathaway does not know Ross's actual symptoms, he mistakenly treats him for Flaze. However, since Ross is alive and the treatment is for a disease that exists, he survives the treatment.

4. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones next, who is also experiencing unknown symptoms. He will treat Jones based on the assumption that he might have Jarkis.

5. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Jarkis, which is the correct treatment for the unknown symptoms he is experiencing. Jones becomes healthy.

At the end of these actions, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Dr. Hathaway's goal.
