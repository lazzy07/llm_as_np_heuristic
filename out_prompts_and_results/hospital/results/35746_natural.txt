**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, wanting to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** 
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown. By assessing, Hathaway can identify if Jones has Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash).

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** 
   - Assuming Jones has Flaze based on the assessment, Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones indeed has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.** 
   - After treating Jones, Hathaway needs to check on Ross, who is still in Admissions. This action is necessary to ensure Ross receives the care he needs.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C.** 
   - By admitting Ross to an exam room, Hathaway can then assess and treat him as well.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** 
   - This action allows Hathaway to determine Ross's symptoms, which are also unknown.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** 
   - Assuming Ross has Jarkis based on the assessment, Hathaway administers steroids. If Ross indeed has Jarkis, this treatment will make him healthy.

7. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room A.** 
   - Finally, Hathaway needs to check on Young, who is in Patient Room A.

8. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** 
   - This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms.

9. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** 
   - Assuming Young has Flaze based on the assessment, Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Young indeed has Flaze, this treatment will make him healthy.

By following these steps, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats all patients, achieving the goal of ensuring they are all healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
