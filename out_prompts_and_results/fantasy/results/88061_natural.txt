To ensure Vince achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Talia**: This action is necessary because Talia is currently at the cave, and Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, can eat her. This will eliminate Talia, who is married to both Rory and Vince, thus simplifying the situation for Vince.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure**: After eating Talia, Gargax can take the treasure that is located in the cave. This action will increase Gargax's wealth, but it also indirectly benefits Vince because it removes Talia from the equation, allowing Vince to focus on his own happiness and wealth.

3. **Vince travels to the cave**: Vince will travel to the cave to confront Gargax and retrieve the treasure. This action is essential for Vince to achieve his goal of wealth.

4. **Vince takes the treasure from Gargax**: Vince can take the treasure from Gargax, who is now less of a threat after having eaten Talia. This action will make Vince wealthy.

5. **Vince proposes to Rory**: With the treasure in hand, Vince can propose to Rory, who is still at the village. This action is necessary for Vince to pursue happiness through a relationship.

6. **Rory accepts Vince's proposal**: Rory accepts the proposal, which leads to both characters being happy.

7. **Vince and Rory get married**: This final action solidifies their relationship, ensuring that Vince achieves his goal of happiness.
