To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a different room to facilitate the next steps.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) as well. This is important because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

3. **tell(C2, C3, I2, R21)**: Blake tells Casey that they want the chocolates (I2). This is a strategic move to ensure Casey believes Blake wants the chocolates, which will lead to a trade.

4. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to join Blake and Casey. This is necessary for Alex to be part of the upcoming trade.

5. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) with Casey for the jewelry (I1). This action is crucial because it allows Casey to give Alex the item they want.

6. **give(C3, I1, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex. This is the final step that ensures Alex gets the item they want.

7. **put_down(C2, I2, R21)**: Blake puts down the chocolates (I2) in the dining room. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving Alex's goal but helps to keep the room organized.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
