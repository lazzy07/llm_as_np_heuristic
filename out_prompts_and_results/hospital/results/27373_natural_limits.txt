Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway is cautious but decides to treat him with antibiotics, believing it might be Flaze. This action is necessary to ensure that Ross receives treatment, as he is currently in a vulnerable state. 

After treating Ross, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. This is important because Young is also in need of care, and admitting him will allow Hathaway to assess and treat him next.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room B. Since Young is also experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway treats him with steroids, believing it might be Jarkis. This action is crucial to ensure that Young receives the appropriate treatment.

In this sequence of actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, ensuring they are healthy and achieving their goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
