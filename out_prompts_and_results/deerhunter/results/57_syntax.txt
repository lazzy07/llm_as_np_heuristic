To achieve Bubba's goal of satisfying his hunger, the story will unfold as follows:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the forest and head back to the bank. This action is necessary because he needs to find a way to satisfy his hunger, and the bank is where he can potentially find food or money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to acquire money, which he can use to buy food later.

3. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba returns to the forest. This action is necessary for him to find a safe place to eat or to plan his next move.

4. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba encounters Bambi. Since he is hungry, he decides to eat Bambi. This action fulfills Bubba's immediate need for food.

Now, let's summarize the reasoning behind each action:

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to leave the forest to find food or money.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses his rifle to steal money from the bank clerk, which is essential for his survival.
- **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Returning to the forest provides Bubba with a safe space after committing the theft.
- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action satisfies Bubba's hunger by consuming Bambi.
