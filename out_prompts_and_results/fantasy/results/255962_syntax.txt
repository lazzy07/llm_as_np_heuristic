To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationship with Rory, as they are already engaged, and she has the treasure. The goal is to get married, which will make both Talia and Rory happy, and Talia will also be wealthy due to her possession of the treasure.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels to the Village to be with Vince and to potentially discuss their situation.
2. **travel(Talia, Cave, Village)**: Talia travels to the Village to meet Rory and Vince.
3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory and Talia get married in the Village, which makes both of them happy.
4. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the Cave to check on Gargax and the situation there.
5. **get_hungry(Vince)**: Vince becomes hungry, which is a natural consequence of his actions.
6. **eat(Gargax, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax eats Vince, which is a necessary action to ensure that Talia's happiness and wealth are not threatened by Vince's presence.

Now, Talia is married to Rory, which fulfills her desire for happiness and wealth, as she has the treasure. 

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Marry action**: This is the key action that fulfills Talia's goal of happiness and wealth.
- **Vince's actions**: Vince's actions are included to show the consequences of his presence and to ensure that Talia's goals are not hindered by him.
