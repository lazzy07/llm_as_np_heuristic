The bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. Since the bandit already has coins in the chest at the bandit camp, she will take the following actions to achieve her goal:

1. The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp. 
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to reach her camp where the coins are stored.

2. The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.
   - This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.

The story is complete with these two actions, as they directly lead to the bandit achieving her goal of having coins.
