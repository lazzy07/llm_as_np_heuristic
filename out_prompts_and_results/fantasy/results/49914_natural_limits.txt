In the cave, Talia, Rory, Vince, and Gargax are present. Talia wants to be happy and wealthy, and she has just accepted Rory's proposal. However, she still lacks wealth. Vince has the money, and Gargax, the dragon, is also in the cave, wanting to be wealthy.

To achieve her goal of wealth, Talia can take the following actions:

1. **Talia takes the money from Vince.** This action is necessary because Talia needs to acquire wealth, and Vince currently possesses the money. By taking the money, Talia will achieve her goal of being wealthy.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure.** This action is also necessary because the treasure is at the cave, and acquiring it will further enhance Talia's wealth, solidifying her goal of being wealthy.

After these actions, Talia will have both the money and the treasure, thus achieving her goal of being wealthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Talia takes the money from Vince:** This action directly addresses Talia's goal of becoming wealthy. Since Vince has the money, taking it ensures that Talia's wealth increases.
- **Talia picks up the treasure:** This action complements the first by adding to Talia's wealth. The treasure is an additional asset that will help her achieve her goal of being wealthy.
