To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in Exam Room A, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Young, who is also in the admissions room. This is important to determine Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is crucial to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that Young also becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to Admissions to assess Jones. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms and provide the correct treatment.

6. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment. This ensures that Jones becomes healthy as well.

By following these steps, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are assessed and treated correctly, leading to their health.
