After completing their chores in the laundry, Ernest and Roy find themselves in a precarious situation. They know the bully is in the gym, and they are both threatened by him. Roy, having stolen the knife from the kitchen, decides to take action.

1. **Lock the Gym**: Roy suggests to Ernest that they should lock the gym door to prevent the bully from coming out. They both move to the hallway and lock the gym door.

5. **Escape to the Highway**: Finally, Roy moves to the hallway and then to the highway, where he successfully escapes from the prison. This action fulfills his goal of wanting to be alive and free.
