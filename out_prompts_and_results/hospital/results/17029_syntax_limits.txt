To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can follow these actions:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway needs to determine Jones's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Jones is in Exam Room B, Hathaway will assess him there.

2. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, if he shows symptoms of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Next, Hathaway will need to assess Ross, who is still in the admissions room. Since Ross has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room C and then assess him.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis.

5. **Walk to Exam Room A**: Finally, Hathaway will walk to Exam Room A to check on Young, who is already assigned there. 

This sequence of actions ensures that Hathaway assesses and treats both patients correctly, leading to their health.
