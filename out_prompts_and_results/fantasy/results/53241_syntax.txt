To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure from the cave. Since Gargax is currently in the village and the treasure is located in the cave, Gargax will need to travel to the cave to collect the treasure. 

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **travel(Gargax, Village, Cave)**: Gargax travels from the village to the cave to reach the treasure. This action is necessary because the treasure is not in the village, and Gargax needs to be at the cave to pick it up.

2. **pickup(Gargax, Treasure, Cave)**: Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve their goal of being wealthy, as the treasure is the item that will increase their wealth.

3. **get_hungry(Gargax)**: Gargax becomes hungry after picking up the treasure. This action is included to reflect Gargax's state after the previous actions, as Gargax has not eaten anyone yet.

4. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, who is still alive in the village. This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger, as Gargax needs to eat to not be hungry anymore.
