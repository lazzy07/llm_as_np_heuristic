To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and happiness while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: Rory picks up the treasure in the cave. This action is essential because it directly contributes to Rory's goal of becoming wealthy.

2. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village. This is necessary for Rory to be in a location where he can interact with Talia and potentially secure his happiness.

3. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia. Since Talia has already accepted Rory's proposal, this action will make both characters happy, fulfilling Rory's goal of happiness.

At this point, Rory has achieved all his goals: he is wealthy (having picked up the treasure), happy (after marrying Talia), and not hungry (as there is no indication of hunger in the story).

### Explanation of Actions:
- **pickup(Rory, Treasure, Cave)**: This action is crucial for Rory to gain wealth, which is one of his primary goals.
- **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory needs to return to the village to marry Talia, which is necessary for his happiness.
- **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: This action fulfills Rory's desire for happiness through marriage, as Talia has accepted his proposal.
