To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe needs to return to the surface to interact with the Lizard and build a relationship. This action is necessary to initiate contact with the Lizard.

2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is important as it allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly.

3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she will attempt to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial for establishing a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

4. **Walk from Cave to Surface**: After making peace, Zoe will walk back to the surface with the Lizard. This action signifies their newfound friendship and ensures they are both safe together.

5. **Erupt (Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now friends and have moved to the surface together, they can escape the danger.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard.
