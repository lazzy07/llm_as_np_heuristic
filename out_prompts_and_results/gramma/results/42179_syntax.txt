To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the market and does not have a sword. This action allows the bandit to take the coin that Tom has, increasing her total coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This is where she can store her coins safely.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit will take the coins from the chest, ensuring she has as many coins as possible.

Now, let's explain why each action is necessary:

- **Robbing Tom** is essential because it allows the bandit to gain an additional coin without risking her own life, as Tom is unarmed. This directly contributes to her goal of carrying more coins.
  
- **Walking to the camp** is necessary for the bandit to secure her stolen coin and any coins she may have in the chest. The camp is a safe location for her to store her loot.

- **Taking the coins from the chest** ensures that the bandit maximizes her coin count, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as possible.
