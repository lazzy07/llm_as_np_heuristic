**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, at Patient Room B, assesses Jones. With a workload of 3, Hathaway mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids. Since this treatment does not match Jones's actual condition (Flaze), Jones dies.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room C. Young, now in Patient Room C, is assessed by Dr. Hathaway. With a workload of 2, Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as unknown but assumes they are experiencing Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing Young.

**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Assess Jones**: This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to determine Jones's condition. However, due to the high workload, Hathaway makes a mistake in diagnosis.
   
2. **Treat Jones with steroids**: This action is taken based on the incorrect diagnosis. It leads to Jones's death, which is not aligned with Jones's goal of being alive and healthy, but it is necessary to progress the story.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway needs to admit Young to continue the treatment process for the remaining patients.

4. **Admit Young to Patient Room C**: This action is necessary to ensure Young receives attention and treatment.

5. **Assess Young**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young to determine their condition. The workload is now manageable, allowing for a correct assessment.

6. **Treat Young with antibiotics**: This action is crucial as it aligns with Young's actual condition (Flaze), leading to Young's recovery and achieving their goal of being alive and healthy.
