To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), the following actions will be taken:

1. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Bubba loads the rifle with ammunition. This action is necessary because it prepares him to either threaten or kill another character, which is essential for achieving his greedy goal of obtaining money.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi. This action directly leads to Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions for the story's ending.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba can now decide to take the money from the bank clerk, as he has demonstrated his willingness to use violence to achieve his goals.

4. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba goes to the bank to confront the clerk and take the money. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story is concise and effectively leads to the desired outcome with minimal actions. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json

  "plan": [
    "load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)",
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "decide_to_get_money(Bubba)",
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of either having the money or Bambi being dead, fulfilling the requirements of the story.
