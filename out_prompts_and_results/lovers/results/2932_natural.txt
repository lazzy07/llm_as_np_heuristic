**Story Completion:**

In the living room, Casey looks at Alex and Blake, who are both present. Casey knows that Alex is happy with the flowers, but Casey wants the jewelry that Blake has. 

1. **Casey tells Blake that Alex wants the jewelry.** (This is a lie, but it creates a situation where Blake might feel compelled to act.)
2. **Blake, believing Casey, decides to give the jewelry to Casey.** (Blake wants to make Alex happy, and since he believes Alex wants the jewelry, he gives it to Casey.)
3. **Casey receives the jewelry from Blake.** (Now, Casey has what they want and is happy.)

At this point, Casey has achieved their goal of being happy with the jewelry.
