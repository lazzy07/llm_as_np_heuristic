Dr. Hathaway, currently in Patient Room C, realizes that she needs to assess the patients in the admissions room to determine their symptoms. With a workload of 3, she is at risk of making a mistake, so she decides to prioritize assessing the patients in Admissions.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room C to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to reach the patients who are currently in the admissions room (Jones, Ross, and Young) and assess their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions.**  
   - By assessing Ross, Dr. Hathaway can determine if he has Flaze or Jarkis, which will help her decide on the appropriate treatment.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Admissions.**  
   - Similarly, assessing Young will provide Dr. Hathaway with the necessary information to treat him correctly.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.**  
   - Assuming Ross shows symptoms of Jarkis (a rash), Dr. Hathaway treats him with steroids, which will make him healthy.

5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.**  
   - Assuming Young shows symptoms of Flaze (a fever), Dr. Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which will also make him healthy.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully assesses and treats both patients, achieving her goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
