To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, assesses and treats Jones correctly to achieve the goal of having all patients healthy. Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomB, Hathaway can assess him and then treat him based on the symptoms observed. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **Assess Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action is crucial to ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

Now, let’s assume that during the assessment, Hathaway correctly identifies that Jones has Flaze (fever) and treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway needs to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is the first step in ensuring that Jones receives the correct treatment.

2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones and determining he has Flaze, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. This action is essential for Jones to recover and become healthy.

After these actions, Jones will be healthy, and since he is the only patient currently in the exam room, Hathaway achieves her goal of having all hospital patients healthy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Hathaway successfully treats Jones, leading to the desired outcome of all patients being healthy.
