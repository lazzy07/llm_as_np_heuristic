Tom, armed with the merchant's sword, is determined to get the medicine from the merchant and return to the cottage. He knows the merchant is at the market, and he believes the guard is at the crossroads, which gives him a chance to act without interference.

1. **Tom walks from the market to the crossroads.** (This action is necessary for Tom to get closer to the merchant and the medicine.)
2. **Tom attacks the bandit.** (The bandit is at the crossroads and is armed, but Tom believes he can take her by surprise. Since the bandit is not carrying a sword, Tom can attack her.)
3. **Tom loots the bandit’s sword.** (After defeating the bandit, Tom takes her sword, which he can use for future encounters.)
4. **Tom walks from the crossroads to the market.** (Now armed with the bandit’s sword, Tom returns to the market to confront the merchant and retrieve the medicine.)

After these actions, Tom successfully retrieves the medicine from the merchant and heads back to the cottage, achieving his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **Attacking the bandit** is a necessary action to eliminate a potential threat and gain an additional weapon.
- **Looting the bandit’s sword** provides Tom with more options for defense or offense in case of future encounters.
