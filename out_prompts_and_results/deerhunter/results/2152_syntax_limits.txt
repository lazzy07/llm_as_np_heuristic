Bubba, driven by greed and hunger, decides to take action in the forest where he finds both Bambi and the opportunity to fulfill his desires. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, sees Bambi as a source of food. He uses the loaded rifle to shoot Bambi, which allows him to eat and satisfy his hunger.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer, fulfilling his hunger.

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to achieve his goal of satisfying his hunger while also being in a position to potentially gather money later, as he is now no longer hungry.
