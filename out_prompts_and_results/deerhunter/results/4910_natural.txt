To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The simplest way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he already has a loaded rifle. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba decides to steal**: Bubba wants to have money, and since he sees the clerk has 1 money, he decides to take it.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money from the clerk.

Now, let's break down the actions:

- **Bubba decides to steal**: This action is necessary because it aligns with Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action directly results in Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money he desires, and the story concludes.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba achieves his goal in the shortest possible way while adhering to the constraints of the story.
