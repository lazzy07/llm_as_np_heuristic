**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest, who is disguised in civilian clothes, decides to make his move. He knows that the bully is locked in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes, which he stole earlier. To ensure his safety and to avoid any confrontation with the bully, Ernest quickly crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once he reaches the highway, he takes off his disguise and blends in with the surroundings, successfully escaping from the prison.
