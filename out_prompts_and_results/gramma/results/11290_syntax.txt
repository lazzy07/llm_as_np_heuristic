To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he has. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently carrying a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the bandit camp. This action is necessary to secure the coins in the chest at the camp, fulfilling her goal.

The story unfolds as follows:

- The Bandit, after attacking the Merchant, sees Tom in the Market. She decides to rob him to take his coin.
- The Bandit successfully robs Tom, increasing her coin count.
- With her new coin, the Bandit walks to the bandit camp to store her coins in the chest, achieving her goal.

Hereâ€™s the explanation for each action:
- **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: This action allows the Bandit to take Tom's coin, which is essential for her goal of accumulating coins.
- **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: This action allows the Bandit to move to the camp where she can secure her coins, thus achieving her goal.
