Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is on the surface and in danger due to the erupting volcano, decides to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety and to foster friendship. She walks from the cave to the surface where the Lizard is located and initiates a conversation to establish a friendly relationship.

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe moves to the surface to find the Lizard, as she believes it is important to be in the same location to communicate and build a friendship.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard, which helps them both achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends.

By making peace, Zoe ensures that both she and the Lizard can work together to avoid the dangers of the erupting volcano and establish a friendship.
