In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are in a cave on the planet, both safe and healthy, but the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. To achieve the goal of having the volcano erupt and ensuring that one character dies while also allowing the two characters to become friends, the following action will be taken:

1. **Erupt the volcano on the surface**: This action will cause the volcano to erupt, leading to the death of Zoe, who is currently in the cave. The eruption will create a situation where the Lizard, as the guardian of the planet, may feel a sense of loss and connection to Zoe, leading to a potential friendship.

The story concludes with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard reflects on the importance of friendship and safety, ultimately deciding to honor Zoe's memory by seeking out other creatures to befriend in the future.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the volcano erupting and causing a character to die. Since Zoe is in the cave and the eruption will affect her, this action leads to her demise, which is a key part of the story's conclusion.
