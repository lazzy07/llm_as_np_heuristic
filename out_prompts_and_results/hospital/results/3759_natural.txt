**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is still manageable for the next action.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A. This increases Hathaway's workload to 4, which is now risky.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A. Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms as well. Due to the high workload, Hathaway mistakenly believes Young has Flaze instead of Jarkis.

Dr. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, thinking it will help. However, since Young actually has Jarkis, the treatment fails, and Young dies.

Despite this unfortunate outcome, Dr. Hathaway's goal of treating patients is achieved, as Jones and Ross are still alive and healthy.
