To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in PatientRoomB to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Young's symptoms are currently unknown, and Hathaway needs to know if Young has Flaze or Jarkis to provide the correct treatment.

2. **Treat Young**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment. If Young has Flaze, Hathaway will administer antibiotics; if Young has Jarkis, Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Treat Ross**: Since Ross has already been assessed and has SymptomB, which indicates he has Jarkis, Hathaway will treat Ross with steroids. This will ensure that Ross also becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that both Young and Ross are treated correctly, achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
