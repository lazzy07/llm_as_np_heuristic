The bandit, realizing that the guard is at the market and the merchant is also there, decides to take advantage of the situation. She walks from the crossroads to the market, where she can find the merchant. The bandit then robs the merchant, taking the hero's coin that the merchant is carrying. With this coin, the bandit can now achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
