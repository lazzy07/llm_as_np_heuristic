In the current situation, Blake (C2) wants to be happy and also wants Alex (C1) to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is in the room with them), and Blake has item I1 (jewelry) that Alex believes is with Casey (C3). 

To achieve Blake's goal of making Alex happy, Blake can give Alex the item I1 (jewelry) that they have. This action will not only make Blake happy but also help Alex achieve their goal of obtaining I3, as it will allow them to focus on getting what they want next.

Here’s the action Blake will take:

1. **give(Blake, I1, Alex, R22)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex in the room (R22). This action makes Blake happy because they have helped Alex, and it also sets the stage for Alex to pursue their own happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- at(C1) = R22; happy(C1) = True (because Alex now has I1); 
- at(C2) = R22; happy(C2) = True (because Blake has made Alex happy);
- at(C3) = R22; happy(C3) = False (Casey is still unhappy as they do not have what they want).

This single action effectively fulfills Blake's goal of making Alex happy.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
