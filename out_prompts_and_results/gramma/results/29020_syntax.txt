To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coins he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently in the Market with coins.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary for the Bandit to secure her coins in the chest at the camp, which is part of her goal.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the Bandit Camp. This action is necessary to ensure that the Bandit has coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as possible.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This is the first step for the Bandit to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. Since Tom is not armed, the Bandit can successfully take his coins.
- **Walking to the Camp**: After acquiring the coins, the Bandit needs to move to a secure location (the Bandit Camp) to store her loot.
- **Taking Coins from the Chest**: This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
