To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia has already picked up the treasure, which contributes to her wealth. However, she is not yet happy. To achieve happiness, she needs to get married to one of the characters who has proposed to her.

Since Talia has two proposals (one from Rory and one from Vince), she can choose to accept one of them. Accepting either proposal will make her happy. For the sake of brevity, we will have Talia accept Rory's proposal and then they will get married.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia accepts Rory's proposal, which makes both of them happy.
2. **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: Talia and Rory get married, solidifying their relationship and ensuring Talia's happiness.

This sequence of actions ensures that Talia becomes happy, fulfilling her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **accept(Talia, Rory, Village)**: This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, as accepting a proposal leads to happiness for both characters involved.
- **marry(Talia, Rory, Village)**: This action finalizes the relationship and confirms Talia's happiness, as marriage is a significant milestone that contributes to her emotional fulfillment.
