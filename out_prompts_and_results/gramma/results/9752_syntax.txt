To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk from the Cottage to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads.

2. **buy(Merchant, Medicine, TomCoin, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will buy the medicine from Tom using one of the coins she has. This action allows the Merchant to gain the medicine while also ensuring she has made a legitimate transaction, thus not becoming a criminal.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will then walk to the Market, where she can continue her business and potentially find more customers or opportunities to sell her items.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity, as she only buys the medicine from Tom and does not rob or attack anyone.
