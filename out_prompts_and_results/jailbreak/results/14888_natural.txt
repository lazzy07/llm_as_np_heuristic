**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway. He knows that he needs to escape the prison to ensure his survival. Meanwhile, Roy is in the gym, where the bully is also present, threatening him. 

1. **Ernest moves to the highway.** (He is already there, so this action is implicit.)
2. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (He has already done this, allowing him to disguise himself for the escape.)
3. **Ernest escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise on the highway, he successfully leaves the prison.)

Roy, still in the gym, is threatened by the bully but cannot escape. However, since Ernest has successfully escaped, he has achieved his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Ernest's disguise is crucial for his escape. By putting on civilian clothes, he avoids detection by the guards.
- The escape action is the final step that allows Ernest to achieve his goal of being alive and free from the threats of the bully and the prison environment.
