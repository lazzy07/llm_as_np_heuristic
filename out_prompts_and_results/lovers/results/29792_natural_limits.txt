In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently in the living room. Since Alex believes that the flowers are in the living room, they can simply pick them up.

**Action: Alex picks up the flowers.**

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy. Since Alex's goal is to be happy, this single action achieves that.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the living room.
- Blake is in the living room.
- Casey is in the living room.
- The flowers are with Alex.
- The chocolates are in the dining room.
- The jewelry are with Alex.
- Alex is happy (because they have the flowers).
- Blake is not happy (still wants chocolates).
- Casey is not happy (still wants jewelry).
