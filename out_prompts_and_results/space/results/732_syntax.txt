To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard, which is essential for them to interact further.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once Zoe reaches the cave, she makes peace with the Lizard. This action signifies that they are no longer enemies and are willing to be friends, which aligns with both characters' goals of making friends.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement of the story to have the volcano erupt, leading to a character's demise.

4. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: The eruption results in the Lizard being killed. This action indicates that the Lizard, despite having made peace with Zoe, is caught in the eruption and dies.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's death. This sequence of events fulfills the story's requirements while maintaining the characters' goals.
