To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want the jewelry, which is currently with Blake (C2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex (C1) can trade the jewelry (I1) they want with Blake (C2) for the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they desire, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I2) and will also be happy.
- Casey will still have the flowers (I3) and will remain happy.

Now, Alex has achieved their goal of being happy.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: This action is crucial as it allows Alex to get the jewelry they want while also satisfying Blake's desire for chocolates. This mutual exchange ensures that both characters can achieve happiness.
