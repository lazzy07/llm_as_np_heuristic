Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport to the surface to help the Lizard, despite their current enmity. She believes that by showing concern for the Lizard's safety, they can begin to build a friendship. 

1. **Zoe teleports from the ship to the surface.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach the Lizard and offer assistance, as she wants to help the Lizard and potentially make a friend.

2. **Zoe walks towards the Lizard.** - This action allows Zoe to approach the Lizard directly, showing her intention to communicate and help rather than fight.

3. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** - By making peace, Zoe and the Lizard can set aside their differences and work together, which aligns with both of their goals of wanting to be healthy, safe, and make friends.

4. **The volcano erupts.** - This event occurs as a consequence of the ongoing danger on the surface. Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, they can face this challenge together.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard teleport to the ship.** - This action is taken to escape the eruption, ensuring both characters remain safe.

In this story, the actions taken by Zoe lead to a resolution where she helps the Lizard, they become friends, and they escape the danger of the erupting volcano together.
