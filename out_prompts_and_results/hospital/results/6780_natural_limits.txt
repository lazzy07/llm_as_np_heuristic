Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, realizes that her workload is too high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions. She decides to walk to Admissions to assess Young, who is still waiting there.

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to assess Young, as she needs to determine the symptoms of all patients to provide appropriate treatment.

2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young.**  
   - By assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway can identify the symptoms and determine the correct treatment. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, she will need to figure out what that is.

3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids.**  
   - Assuming Young has Jarkis (the only disease that could be unknown), Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This action is crucial for achieving her goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

4. **Dr. Hathaway walks back to Patient Room B.**  
   - After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to continue her work with Ross and Jones, ensuring she can monitor their conditions as well.

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats Young, ensuring that at least one patient is healthy, which contributes to her overall goal of having all patients healthy.
