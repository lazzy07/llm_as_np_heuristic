To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit robs the hero.** The bandit uses her sword to rob the hero, who is carrying the medicine and the merchant's sword but no coins. This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the hero as a threat and take any valuable items. However, since the hero has no coins, the bandit will not gain coins from this action.

2. **The bandit attacks the hero.** The bandit attacks the hero to eliminate him. This is necessary because the hero is a criminal and poses a threat to the bandit. By killing the hero, the bandit can ensure her safety and potentially loot the hero's items afterward.

3. **The bandit loots the hero's corpse.** After killing the hero, the bandit loots the hero's corpse to take the medicine. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to gain an item that could be useful for her or for trading.

4. **The bandit walks back to the bandit camp.** The bandit then walks back to the bandit camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she may have acquired. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

5. **The bandit places the medicine and any coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** Finally, the bandit places the medicine and any coins she has in the chest at the bandit camp. This action is necessary to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. The bandit robs the hero.
2. The bandit attacks the hero.
3. The bandit loots the hero's corpse.
4. The bandit walks back to the bandit camp.
