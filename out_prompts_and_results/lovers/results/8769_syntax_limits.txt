In the current situation, Casey (C3) is in the living room (R21) and wants the jewelry (I3) that is currently with Alex (C1) in the bedroom (R12). To achieve their goal of being happy, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry. 

Here’s the shortest story where Casey achieves their goal:

1. **Casey tells Alex that they want the jewelry.** This action is necessary because it allows Casey to express their desire directly to Alex, who is currently holding the item Casey wants. 

2. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey.** This action is crucial as it allows Casey to receive the item they want, thus making them happy.

Now, let's break down the actions:

- **tell(C3, C1, I3, R21)**: Casey communicates their desire for the jewelry to Alex. This is important because it sets the stage for the next action, allowing Alex to understand what Casey wants.
  
- **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey. This is the key action that fulfills Casey's desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Casey has the jewelry they wanted, achieving their goal of happiness.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C3, C1, I3, R21)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Casey's happiness by ensuring they receive the item they desire.
