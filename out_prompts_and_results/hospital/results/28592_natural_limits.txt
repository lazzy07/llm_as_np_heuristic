**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Jones is in Patient Room C, decides to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. 

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is necessary for Dr. Hathaway to understand what symptoms Jones is experiencing. Since Jones is alive and in Patient Room C, this assessment will help identify if he has Flaze or Jarkis.

After assessing Jones, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

2. **Action: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze in Patient Room C.**  
   - This action is crucial as it allows Dr. Hathaway to provide the correct treatment (antibiotics) for Jones's condition. By treating Jones correctly, he will become healthy, achieving his goal of being alive and healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action (assessing Jones) is essential to determine the correct diagnosis. Without this step, Dr. Hathaway would not know how to treat Jones effectively.
- The second action (treating Jones) is the final step that ensures Jones's health. Since the treatment matches the symptoms, it guarantees that Jones will recover.
