To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move away from the guard and the hero, who are both at the market, and to create distance from potential threats.

2. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - The bandit needs to return to the camp to access the chest where her coins are stored. This is essential for her to achieve her goal of carrying coins.

3. **The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to collect the coins she desires, fulfilling her goal of having as many coins as possible.

Now, the story is complete, and the bandit has successfully achieved her goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first two actions are about moving to a safe location (the bandit camp) where the bandit can access her coins without the risk of being attacked by the guard or robbed by the hero.
- The final action of looting the coins from the chest is the culmination of her plan, allowing her to achieve her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
