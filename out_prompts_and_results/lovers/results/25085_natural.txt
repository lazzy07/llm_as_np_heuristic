To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the chocolates, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to access the chocolates, which are located in the dining room.

2. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to obtain the item they want, which is essential for their happiness.

3. **Blake moves from the dining room to the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to return to the living room to be with Casey and to potentially interact with Alex.

4. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action is not necessary for Blake's happiness but is included to ensure Casey is happy, as Casey wants the jewelry, which is with Alex. This action also helps maintain the relationships among the characters.

5. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.**  
   - Casey needs to go to the bathroom to interact with Alex, who is currently there.

6. **Casey gives the flowers to Alex in the bathroom.**  
   - This action allows Alex to receive the flowers they want, which will make Alex happy.

7. **Alex gives the jewelry to Casey in the bathroom.**
