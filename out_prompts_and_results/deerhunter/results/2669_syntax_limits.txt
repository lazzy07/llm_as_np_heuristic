To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can follow this sequence of actions:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba is currently in the forest and wants to get the money from the bank. This action takes him to the bank where the clerk is located.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action results in the clerk being dead, which allows Bubba to take the money without any resistance.

After these actions, Bubba will have the money from the bank clerk, fulfilling the requirement of the story.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the bank where the money is located. Without this action, he cannot interact with the clerk or obtain the money.
- **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money. By shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money without facing any consequences from the clerk.
