**Story Completion:**

After venting into the gym, Roy finds himself in a tense situation with the bully. The bully, unaware of Roy's presence, is busy lifting weights. Roy knows he has to act quickly to ensure both his and Ernest's safety. He decides to take revenge on the bully by using the knife he stole from the kitchen.

Roy approaches the bully silently and, with a swift motion, he kills the bully. With the threat eliminated, Roy feels a sense of relief. He quickly checks the gym for any other items that might help him and then heads back to the hallway.

Now that the bully is no longer a threat, Roy can focus on escaping. He goes to the hallway, puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier, and then crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison. Once on the highway, he successfully escapes from the prison, achieving his goal of being alive and free.
