To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the room where the flowers are located (R22). This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R12). This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows for potential interactions with the other characters.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves to the room where the flowers are located (R22). This action is included to allow Casey to see that Alex has the flowers.

5. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Blake moves to the room where the flowers are located (R22). This action is included for the same reason as Casey's move.

At this point, Alex has the flowers and is happy. The other characters can see that Alex has achieved their goal, but their happiness is not the focus of this story.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "pick_up(C1, I1, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)",
    "move(C3, R12, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.
- **pick_up(C1, I1, R22)**: This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: While not necessary for Alex's happiness, it allows for interaction with other characters.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)** and **move(C3, R12, R22)**: These actions allow Casey and Blake to witness Alex's happiness, which may contribute to their own happiness indirectly.
