To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the following actions will be taken:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. Rory is in the Village, and Gargax can eat him. This action will also eliminate one of the humans, allowing Gargax to take the treasure from Rory later.

2. **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Village)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that Rory had. This will make Gargax wealthy.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Village)**: This action is necessary for Gargax to satisfy their hunger. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, they will prioritize their hunger and wealth. Eating Rory also removes a competitor for wealth.

- **take(Gargax, Treasure, Rory, Village)**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that Rory had picked up earlier. This action directly contributes to Gargax's goal of becoming wealthy.

With these two actions, Gargax will achieve their goal of being wealthy and not hungry.
