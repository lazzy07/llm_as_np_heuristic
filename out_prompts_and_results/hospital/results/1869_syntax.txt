To ensure that all patients are healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient based on their symptoms. Given the current situation, we know that Ross has SymptomA, which corresponds to Jarkis, and Young has SymptomB, which corresponds to Flaze. Jones's symptom is unknown, but since Hathaway is in the same room as Jones, they can assess Jones to determine their condition.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Hathaway achieving their goal:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomB to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to understand if Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Ross in Admissions with steroids, as Ross has SymptomA (Jarkis). This will ensure Ross becomes healthy.

3. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young in Admissions with antibiotics, as Young has SymptomB (Flaze). This will ensure Young becomes healthy.

By following this sequence, Hathaway will successfully treat all patients, achieving their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Jones**: This action is crucial to identify Jones's condition, which is currently unknown. It allows Hathaway to make an informed decision about treatment.
- **Treat Ross**: Since Ross has been identified with Jarkis, treating him with the correct medication (steroids) will ensure he recovers.
- **Treat Young**: Similarly, treating Young with antibiotics for Flaze will ensure he recovers as well.
