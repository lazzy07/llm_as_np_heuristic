To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). The following actions will lead to that outcome:

1. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves from the dining room (R12) to the bedroom (R21) where the jewelry (I3) is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as the jewelry to give it to Casey.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey (C3) in the bedroom (R21). This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is still unhappy because they do not have the flowers (I1).
- Blake (C2) is happy because they have given away the jewelry (I3) and helped Casey.
- Casey (C3) is now happy because they have received the jewelry (I3).

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
