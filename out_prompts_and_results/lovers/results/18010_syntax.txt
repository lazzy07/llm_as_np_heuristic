To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey is located. This is important because Alex wants to share their happiness with Casey.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers to themselves (this is a way to signify that Alex is now happy with the flowers). This action ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.
