To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is essential to gather information.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms observed. If Ross shows signs of Flaze (fever), Hathaway will administer antibiotics. If he shows signs of Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will administer steroids. This action is crucial to ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

By taking these two actions, Hathaway can effectively assess and treat Ross, thereby achieving the goal of making all patients healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess(Ross)**: This action is necessary to identify Ross's symptoms and determine the correct treatment. It is the first step in the treatment process.
- **Treat(Ross)**: This action is the culmination of the assessment. By treating Ross correctly, Hathaway ensures that he recovers, contributing to the overall goal of patient health.
