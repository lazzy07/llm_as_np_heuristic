**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, Rash, PatientRoomB**: Hathaway walks into Exam Room B where Young is assigned. Since Young is in the admissions room, Hathaway assesses Young to check for symptoms. This is necessary to determine if Young has Jarkis or Flaze. 

2. **Treat Hathaway, Young, Steroids, PatientRoomB**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that Young has a rash, indicating Jarkis. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, which makes Young healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**

- **Assessing Young**: This action is crucial because it allows Hathaway to identify the symptoms of Young's condition. Without this assessment, Hathaway cannot determine the appropriate treatment.
  
- **Treating Young**: This action is essential as it directly leads to Young's recovery. By administering the correct treatment (steroids for Jarkis), Hathaway fulfills their goal of ensuring that all hospital patients are healthy.
