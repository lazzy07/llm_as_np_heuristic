**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take advantage of the situation. He knows that the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, but he also has the cigarettes, which he can use as leverage. 

1. **Ernest moves to the gym.** (He needs to confront the bully to ensure his safety and to potentially eliminate the threat.)
2. **Ernest locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference.)
3. **Ernest retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (He needs the knife to defend himself and to eliminate the bully.)
4. **Ernest kills the bully with the knife.** (This action removes the threat to both himself and Roy, allowing them to be safe.)
5. **Ernest escapes to the highway while still disguised.** (With the bully gone, he can safely leave the prison.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Moving to the gym allows Ernest to confront the bully directly, which is necessary to resolve the threat.
- Locking the gym door ensures that the bully cannot escape or call for help, making it a controlled environment for the confrontation.
- Retrieving the knife is crucial for Ernest's safety, as it gives him the means to defend himself against the bully.
- Killing the bully is the ultimate action that ensures both Ernest and Roy are no longer threatened, fulfilling Ernest's goal of staying alive and safe.
- Escaping to the highway while disguised allows Ernest to finally achieve his goal of being alive and free.
