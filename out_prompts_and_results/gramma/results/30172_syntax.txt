To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom is currently at the Crossroads and needs to get to the Cottage to fulfill his goal. This action moves him directly to his desired location.

This is the only action needed because Tom already has the medicine in his possession from the previous events. By walking directly to the Cottage, he successfully completes his goal.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is necessary as it allows Tom to reach the Cottage, where he wants to be while carrying the medicine. Since he already has the medicine, this action directly leads him to his goal.
