In the current situation, Blake (C3) is unhappy because they do not have the item they want (I2). To achieve their goal of being happy, Blake needs to acquire the item I2. Since Alex (C1) is currently holding I1, and Casey (C2) is holding I3, Blake can trade with Casey to get I2.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I3) they received from Casey for the flowers (I2) that Casey wants. This action is necessary because it allows Blake to obtain the item they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Blake will be happy because they now have the item they wanted (I2).
- Casey will also be happy because they received the item they wanted (I3).

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of happiness through this trade.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:

{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R22)"]
}
