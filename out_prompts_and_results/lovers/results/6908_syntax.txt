To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R12). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to facilitate the next actions.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I1) to Alex (C1) in the bathroom (R12). This action is crucial because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for Alex to have the jewelry, which is also what Alex wants.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves from the bathroom (R12) to the dining room (R22). This is necessary for Alex to be in the same room as Blake.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to Blake (C2) in the dining room (R22). This action makes Blake happy because they now have the item they want.
