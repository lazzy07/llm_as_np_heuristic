In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is determined to ensure all patients are healthy. The current situation involves Jones in Exam Room B, Young in Exam Room C, and Ross in the Admissions room. To achieve their goal, Hathaway needs to assess and treat the patients effectively.

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway walks to Exam Room B to assess Jones. This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which will inform the treatment plan. 

2. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway finds that he has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze, ensuring that Jones becomes healthy.

This sequence of actions allows Hathaway to successfully treat one patient, moving closer to their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy. 

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:
