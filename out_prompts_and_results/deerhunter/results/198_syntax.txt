To achieve the goal of either having Bubba with the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba leaves the house where he picked up the rifle and ammunition and heads to the bank to confront the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach the location where he can potentially acquire money.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Upon arriving at the bank, Bubba loads the rifle with the ammunition he picked up. This is crucial because he needs a loaded gun to intimidate the bank clerk and to steal the money.

3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the bank clerk. This action is essential for Bubba to achieve his goal of acquiring money.

4. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After stealing the money, Bubba decides to leave the bank and head to the forest. This action is necessary for Bubba to escape the scene and potentially encounter Bambi.

5. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: In the forest, Bubba encounters Bambi and, with the rifle still loaded, he shoots Bambi. This action fulfills the condition of having Bambi dead.

By following these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead, achieving both possible outcomes.
