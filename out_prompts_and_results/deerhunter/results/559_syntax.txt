To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because it directly leads to Bubba obtaining the money he desires.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is crucial because it allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only other character with money. After this action, Bubba will have the money from the clerk.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: Bubba then goes to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary to transition Bubba to the location where Bambi is.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi. This action ensures that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

By executing these actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money and Bambi is dead.
