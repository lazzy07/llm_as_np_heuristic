To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The Bandit will rob Tom to take the coin he is carrying. This action is necessary because the Bandit wants to increase her coin count, and Tom is currently at the Market with a coin.

2. **walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will walk to the Camp to secure her coins in the chest. This action is essential for the Bandit to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

The Bandit successfully robs Tom and then moves to the Camp, where she can store her coins safely.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Robbing Tom**: This action is crucial for the Bandit to increase her coin count without drawing attention from the Guard, as Tom is not armed and is an easy target.
- **Walking to Camp**: This action allows the Bandit to secure her stolen coins in a safe location, fulfilling her goal of having coins in the chest.
