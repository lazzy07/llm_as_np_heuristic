To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to focus on the items they want and the actions that can lead to that outcome. Given the current situation, Blake is in the living room (R21) and has the chocolates (I2), which is what Casey wants. However, Blake wants the jewelry (I3), which is currently with Alex (C1) in the dining room (R22). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the jewelry (I3) that Casey has. This is possible because both characters are in the same room (R21) and it allows Blake to obtain the item they want.

2. **Move**: After the trade, Blake will move to the dining room (R22) to be with Alex (C1) and Casey (C3).

3. **Give**: Finally, Blake can give the jewelry (I3) to Alex (C1) to ensure that Alex is happy as well, since Alex wants the jewelry.

Now, let's break down the reasoning for each action:

- **Trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)**: This action allows Blake to obtain the jewelry they want by giving away the chocolates. It directly addresses Blake's goal of achieving happiness.

- **Move(C2, R21, R22)**: This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Alex, where they can interact further.

- **Give(C2, I3, C1, R22)**: This action ensures that Alex receives the jewelry, which is what they want, thus making Alex happy. Since Blake's happiness is tied to Alex's happiness, this action is crucial.

Now, here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "trade(C3, I2, C2, I3, R21)",
    "move(C2, R21, R22)",
    "give(C2, I3, C1, R22)"
  ]
}
```

This sequence of actions ensures that Blake achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire while also considering the happiness of Alex.
