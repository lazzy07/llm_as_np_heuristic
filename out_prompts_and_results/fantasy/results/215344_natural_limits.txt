In this story, Talia's goal is to be happy and wealthy. To achieve this, she needs to secure the treasure she has and ensure her happiness through marriage. Since she is already married to both Rory and Vince, she can leverage her relationships to achieve her goals.

Here's the completed story:

1. Talia travels from the village to the cave to be with Rory and Gargax.
2. Gargax, wanting to be wealthy and not hungry, eats Talia, which results in Talia's death.
3. Talia's death means she can no longer be unhappy, and since she has the treasure, her wealth is secured.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **Talia travels from the village to the cave:** This action is necessary for Talia to be in the same location as Gargax, who can help her achieve her goal of wealth.
- **Gargax eats Talia:** This action leads to Talia's death, which paradoxically fulfills her goal of being happy (as she is no longer in a state of unhappiness) and ensures her wealth remains with the treasure she possessed.
