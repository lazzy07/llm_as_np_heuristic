To ensure Talia achieves her goal of being happy and wealthy, we need to focus on her relationships and the items she possesses. Talia currently has the treasure, which contributes to her wealth, and she has accepted a marriage proposal from Vince, which can lead to her happiness. However, she also has a proposed relationship with Rory, which complicates her situation.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the village to be away from Talia and Gargax, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Vince without interference.
   - This action is necessary to remove Rory from the cave, where he could complicate Talia's situation.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory, eliminating him as a competitor for Talia's affections and ensuring that Talia can focus on her relationship with Vince.
   - This action is necessary to remove Rory from the story, allowing Talia to be free to marry Vince without any complications.

3. **marry(Talia, Vince, Cave)**: Talia marries Vince, which makes both of them happy.
   - This action is crucial as it fulfills Talia's goal of achieving happiness through marriage.

4. **pickup(Talia, Money, Cave)**: Talia picks up the money that Gargax had, increasing her wealth.
   - This action is necessary to ensure Talia becomes wealthy, fulfilling her goal.

Now, Talia is married to Vince, which makes her happy, and she has both the treasure and the money, making her wealthy.
