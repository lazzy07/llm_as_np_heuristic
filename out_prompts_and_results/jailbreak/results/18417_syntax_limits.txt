Ernest, currently in the hallway, knows he is threatened by the bully and wants to ensure his survival. He has successfully stolen a pack of cigarettes and a knife, but he needs to escape the prison to be truly safe. 

To achieve this, Ernest decides to put on the civilian clothes he previously stole from the laundry room. However, since the guards confiscated the clothes, he cannot disguise himself. Instead, he must take a more direct approach. 

Ernest moves to the gym, where the bully is currently located. He knows that he can kill the bully with the knife, which will eliminate the threat to both himself and Roy. 

Ernest enters the gym and confronts the bully. In a swift motion, he uses the knife to kill the bully, ensuring his own safety and that of his friend Roy. With the bully out of the way, Ernest can now focus on escaping the prison.
