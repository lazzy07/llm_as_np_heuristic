Zoe, the space explorer, is currently on her spaceship, safe and healthy. She knows that the Lizard, the guardian of the planet, is on the surface and is not safe. Zoe wants to make friends with the Lizard, so she decides to teleport back to the surface to meet him.

1. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports from her spaceship to the surface of the planet. This action is necessary because she needs to be on the same location as the Lizard to interact with him and work towards making friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is one of Zoe's goals.

Now that they are friends, Zoe and the Lizard can work together to ensure their safety on the dangerous surface.

The story concludes with Zoe achieving her goal of making friends with the Lizard while ensuring both of their safety.
