To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with the chocolates, which are the item they want.

2. **give(C3, I2, C1, R21)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Alex (C1) in the dining room (R21). This action is important because it allows Alex to receive an item, which may help in their happiness, even though it is not the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Casey and receive the chocolates. This is necessary for Alex to be present to accept the chocolates.

4. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R21) to be with Alex and Casey. This action is included to ensure that all characters are together, which may facilitate further actions.

5. **trade(C1, I2, C2, I1, R21)**: Alex trades the chocolates (I2) they received from Casey with Blake (C2) for the jewelry (I1). This is the crucial action that allows Alex to finally obtain the item they want, thus achieving their happiness.

6. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22) after the trade. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to conclude the scene.

After these actions, Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy, achieving their goal.
