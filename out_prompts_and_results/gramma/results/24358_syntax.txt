To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Here’s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: Tom needs to leave the market to get closer to the cottage. This action is necessary to move towards his goal.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: Tom continues on his path to the cottage. This action is essential as it brings him directly to his desired location.

3. **take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Cottage)**: Tom takes the medicine from the merchant, which is crucial for him to achieve his goal of carrying the medicine to the cottage.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)**: This action is necessary for Tom to leave the market, where he currently is, and head towards the crossroads, which is a step closer to the cottage.
  
- **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)**: This action is essential as it allows Tom to reach the cottage directly from the crossroads, fulfilling his goal of being at the cottage.

- **take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Cottage)**: This action is critical because it allows Tom to acquire the medicine he desires to carry to the cottage, thus completing his objective.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)",
    "take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage with the medicine, achieving his goal efficiently.
