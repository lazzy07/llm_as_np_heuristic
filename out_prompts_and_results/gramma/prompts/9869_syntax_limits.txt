 I will describe a setting and the first part of a story. Your job is to complete the story to ensure it has a specific ending. 

There are four locations in this story: the cottage, the market, the bandit camp, and a crossroads. There is a path from the cottage to the crossroads. There is a path from the market to the crossroads. There is a path from the bandit camp to the crossroads. There are six items in this story: three swords, two coins, and some medicine. There are four characters in this story. The hero is named Tom. Tom wants to be at the cottage carrying the medicine. There is also a merchant character. The merchant wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, and she prefers to be at the market. There is also a guard character. The guard wants to kill criminals, and he prefers to be at the market. There is also a bandit character. The bandit is a criminal. The bandit wants to be carrying as many coins as she can or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp, and she prefers to be at the bandit camp. There are seven kinds of actions characters can take in the story. A character can walk from one location to another if there is a path. A character can buy an item from the merchant by giving the merchant a coin they are carrying. One character who is carrying a sword can rob a second character and take one of the items the second character is carrying as long as the second character is not carrying a sword. One character who is carrying a sword can attack and kill a second character as long as the second character is not carrying a sword. A character can loot an item from the corpse of a dead character. A character can report the location of the bandit to the guard.

 

 Available actions for you are : 
attack(character : character, other : character, place : place),buy(character : character, item : item, coin : coin, place : place),loot(character : character, item : item, other : character, place : place),report(character : character, spot : place, place : place),rob(character : character, item : item, victim : character, place : place),take(character : character, item : item, Chest, Camp),walk(character : character, from : place, to : place)


 These events have already happened in the story: 
walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market); walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads); walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads); walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market); walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads); walk(Merchant, Market, Crossroads); attack(Bandit, Tom, Crossroads)


 This is the current situation after those events:
alive(Tom) = False; alive(Merchant) = True; alive(Guard) = True; alive(Bandit) = True; armed(Tom) = False; armed(Merchant) = True; armed(Guard) = True; armed(Bandit) = True; criminal(Tom) = False; criminal(Merchant) = False; criminal(Guard) = False; location(Tom) = Crossroads; location(Merchant) = Crossroads; location(Guard) = Market; location(Bandit) = Crossroads; location(Medicine) = Merchant; location(TomCoin) = Tom; location(BanditCoin) = ?; location(GuardSword) = Guard; location(BanditSword) = Bandit; location(MerchantSword) = Merchant; believes(Tom, location(Tom)) = Crossroads; believes(Tom, location(Merchant)) = Crossroads; believes(Tom, location(Guard)) = Market; believes(Tom, location(Bandit)) = Crossroads; believes(Tom, location(Medicine)) = Merchant; believes(Tom, location(TomCoin)) = Tom; believes(Tom, location(BanditCoin)) = ?; believes(Tom, location(GuardSword)) = Guard; believes(Tom, location(BanditSword)) = Bandit; believes(Tom, location(MerchantSword)) = Merchant; believes(Merchant, location(Tom)) = Crossroads; believes(Merchant, location(Merchant)) = Crossroads; believes(Merchant, location(Guard)) = Market; believes(Merchant, location(Bandit)) = Crossroads; believes(Merchant, location(Medicine)) = Merchant; believes(Merchant, location(TomCoin)) = Tom; believes(Merchant, location(BanditCoin)) = ?; believes(Merchant, location(GuardSword)) = Guard; believes(Merchant, location(BanditSword)) = Bandit; believes(Merchant, location(MerchantSword)) = Merchant; believes(Guard, location(Tom)) = Crossroads; believes(Guard, location(Merchant)) = Crossroads; believes(Guard, location(Guard)) = Market; believes(Guard, location(Bandit)) = Camp; believes(Guard, location(Medicine)) = Merchant; believes(Guard, location(TomCoin)) = Tom; believes(Guard, location(BanditCoin)) = ?; believes(Guard, location(GuardSword)) = Guard; believes(Guard, location(BanditSword)) = Bandit; believes(Guard, location(MerchantSword)) = Merchant; believes(Bandit, location(Tom)) = Crossroads; believes(Bandit, location(Merchant)) = Crossroads; believes(Bandit, location(Guard)) = Market; believes(Bandit, location(Bandit)) = Crossroads; believes(Bandit, location(Medicine)) = Merchant; believes(Bandit, location(TomCoin)) = Tom; believes(Bandit, location(BanditCoin)) = ?; believes(Bandit, location(GuardSword)) = Guard; believes(Bandit, location(BanditSword)) = Bandit; believes(Bandit, location(MerchantSword)) = Merchant; 


 Complete the story using only these locations, items, characters, and actions. Do not invent new locations, items, characters, or actions. Characters should only take actions that help to achieve their goals, and the story should only include actions which are necessary to achieve the ending. Give me the shortest story 

 where Merchant  achieves their goal.


 Explain why each action is in the story. After the explanation of the whole story, give a JSON object with the final plan. The JSON should include an array called 'plan' with the sequence of actions (as a string) taken to achieve the goal. Example format: {plan: ['action1', 'action2', 'action3']}.

 While keeping the story complete, a smaller story is preferred. Suggested maximum number of the actions in the story: 1.
