Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. They both want to be healthy and safe, and they have successfully made peace with each other. To ensure their safety, Zoe decides to take action.

1. **Zoe teleports to the spaceship.** - This action is necessary for Zoe to reach a safe location away from the dangerous surface. Since she is currently not safe, teleporting to the spaceship will protect her.

2. **Zoe teleports back to the surface.** - After ensuring her safety, Zoe returns to the surface to check on the Lizard and maintain their friendship. This action reinforces their bond and shows her commitment to being friends.

3. **Zoe and the Lizard walk together to the cave.** - By walking to the cave, they find a safer environment away from the dangers of the surface. This action allows them to stay together and continue their friendship in a secure location.

4. **Zoe and the Lizard make peace again.** - Although they are already friends, reaffirming their peace ensures that they remain allies and can work together to stay safe.

5. **Zoe and the Lizard stay in the cave.** - By remaining in the cave, they are both safe from the dangers of the surface, fulfilling their goals of being healthy and safe while also being friends.

This sequence of actions ensures that both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of safety, health, and friendship.
