To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is necessary:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels to the cave where Gargax is located. This is essential because Rory needs to confront Gargax to secure his wealth and ensure he is not hungry.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included because it leads to Rory's death, which allows Vince to take the money from Rory's body, thus achieving Rory's goal of wealth indirectly through Vince.

3. **take(Vince, Money, Rory, Village)**: Vince takes the money from Rory's dead body. This action is necessary for Vince to become wealthy, which indirectly fulfills Rory's goal of wealth since Rory's happiness is tied to Vince's success.

4. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Vince marries Talia. This action is included because it leads to Talia's happiness, which is a part of Rory's goal of happiness through the happiness of those around him.

In this story, Rory's goal is achieved through the actions of others after his demise, as he indirectly influences their happiness and wealth.
