Zoe, realizing the danger of the erupting surface, decides to teleport back down to the planet to confront the Lizard and seek a way to make peace. She teleports to the surface, but the Lizard, believing Zoe is still at the ship, is caught off guard. 

Once on the surface, Zoe approaches the cave where the Lizard resides. The Lizard, sensing Zoe's presence, emerges from the cave, ready to defend its territory. However, instead of attacking, Zoe speaks to the Lizard, explaining her intentions to befriend it and work together to ensure their mutual safety. 

The Lizard, initially skeptical, listens to Zoe's words. Just as they begin to understand each other, the volcano erupts violently, sending lava flows toward them. In a moment of panic, the Lizard instinctively pushes Zoe out of the way, but in doing so, it gets caught in the eruption and is fatally injured. 

Zoe, devastated by the Lizard's sacrifice, realizes that they had formed a bond in that brief moment. She vows to honor the Lizard's memory and protect the planet, ensuring that their friendship will not be forgotten. 

This story ends with the volcano erupting, the Lizard dying, and Zoe and the Lizard forming a friendship in their final moments.
