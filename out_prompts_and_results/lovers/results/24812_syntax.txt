To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C2). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I1) is located. This action is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the jewelry (I1) from the dining room (R21). This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they desire.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room (R22). This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but helps to maintain the flow of the story and keeps Alex in the same room as the other characters.

4. **give(C1, I1, C1, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I1) to themselves. This action is a bit unconventional but serves to illustrate that Alex now possesses the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the jewelry (I1), which is what they wanted.
