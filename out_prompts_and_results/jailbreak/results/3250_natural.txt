As the day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he needs to help Ernest while also ensuring their safety. He decides to take action.

1. **Roy moves to the gym.** (Roy knows the bully is in the gym and wants to confront him to protect Ernest.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to deal with him.)
3. **Roy takes the knife from the kitchen.** (Roy needs a weapon to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)
4. **Roy confronts the bully.** (Roy is now ready to face the bully, who is a threat to both him and Ernest.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action eliminates the immediate threat to both him and Ernest.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now safely return to Ernest and ensure they both can escape together.
