To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will walk to the Market to confront the Guard and take advantage of the situation. This is necessary because the Bandit needs to be in the same location as the Guard to execute the next action.

2. **attack(Bandit, Guard, Market)**: The Bandit will attack the Guard. Since the Guard is armed and the Bandit is also armed, this action is possible. The Bandit aims to eliminate the Guard to ensure there are no obstacles in obtaining the coins.

3. **loot(Bandit, GuardSword, Guard, Market)**: After successfully attacking the Guard, the Bandit will loot the Guard's sword. This action is necessary to ensure the Bandit is armed and can defend against any potential threats in the future.

4. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from the chest at the bandit camp. This action fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest.

The sequence of actions ensures that the Bandit eliminates the only threat (the Guard) and secures the coins, achieving her goal.
