To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface, where the Lizard is located. This action is necessary to bring Zoe into the same location as the Lizard, allowing for potential interactions.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard make peace with each other on the surface. This action is crucial as it allows them to become friends, fulfilling Zoe's goal of making friends with other creatures.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts on the surface. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story where a character dies. Since the Lizard is on the surface and the surface is dangerous, the eruption will lead to the Lizard's demise.

The final sequence of actions leads to the following outcomes:
- Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption.
- The Lizard dies due to the eruption of the volcano.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: This action is essential to bring Zoe to the same location as the Lizard, allowing for interaction.
- **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action establishes a friendship between Zoe and the Lizard, aligning with their goals of making friends.
- **erupt(Surface)**: This action causes the volcano to erupt, resulting in the Lizard's death, which is a necessary outcome for the story.
