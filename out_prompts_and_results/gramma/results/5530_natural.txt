**Story Completion:**

1. The bandit, armed with her sword, walks from the market to the crossroads. (This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to her goal of acquiring coins.)
   
2. The bandit then walks from the crossroads to the cottage. (This action allows the bandit to access the chest where her coins are stored.)

3. The bandit loots the coins from the chest at the cottage. (This action fulfills the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as she can.)

**Explanation of Actions:**

- The bandit first moves to the crossroads to create distance from the hero and the guard, who are both at the market. This is strategic to avoid confrontation.
- By moving to the cottage, the bandit can access her stash of coins without interference from the other characters.
- Finally, looting the coins from the chest directly achieves the bandit's goal of having coins, thus completing her objective.
