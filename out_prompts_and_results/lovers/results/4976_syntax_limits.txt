In this story, we want to ensure that Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the item they want, which is jewelry (I3). 

Given the current situation, hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves from the living room (R12) to the dining room (R22) where Alex and Blake are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) they have to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they have given away the item they had (I3) to Casey.
- Casey (C3) will be happy because they received the jewelry (I3) they wanted.
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy, but since the goal is for Casey to be happy, this is acceptable.
