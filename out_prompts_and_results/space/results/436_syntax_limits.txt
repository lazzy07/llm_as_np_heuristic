Zoe, having just teleported back to the surface, realizes the danger of the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make peace with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the cave where the Lizard is and calls out to him, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of being healthy and safe, and it helps to improve their relationship.

2. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: As Zoe and the Lizard are making peace, the volcano begins to erupt. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of the story ending with the volcano erupting.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, causing chaos on the surface. Since Zoe is on the surface and the volcano has erupted, she is caught in the eruption and dies. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

The story ends with the Lizard now alone, having made peace with Zoe before the eruption, which means he can remember her as a friend.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)",
    "begin_erupt(Surface)",
    "erupt(Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is chosen to ensure that the characters achieve their goals while also leading to the required story outcomes. The first action establishes a friendship, the second and third actions lead to the eruption and the death of Zoe, fulfilling the story's conditions.
