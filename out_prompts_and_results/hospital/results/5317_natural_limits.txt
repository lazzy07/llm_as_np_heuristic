Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room C.** (This action is necessary to assign Jones to an exam room so that Hathaway can assess and treat him.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Patient Room C.** (Hathaway needs to be in the same room as Jones to assess him.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C.** (This action is crucial to determine Jones's symptoms, which are currently unknown.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** (Assuming Jones has a fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** (After assessing Ross in Patient Room A, Hathaway treats him with steroids, assuming he has a rash.)

By following these actions, Dr. Hathaway successfully treats both patients, ensuring they are healthy.
