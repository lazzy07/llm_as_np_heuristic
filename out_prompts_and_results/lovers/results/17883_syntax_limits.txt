In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants the flowers (I1) to be happy, but they are not happy yet. Casey (C3) is already happy with the jewelry (I3) they received from Blake (C2). Blake (C2) wants chocolates (I2) but does not have them yet. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)**: Alex can trade the flowers (I1) they want with Blake for the chocolates (I2) that Blake wants. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will be happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake will be happy because they have the chocolates.
- Casey will remain happy with the jewelry.

This single trade action effectively satisfies Alex's goal while also ensuring that Blake achieves their happiness.
