To complete the story, we need to ensure that Alex is happy, which means Alex must have the item they want (I1). Since Alex already has I1, we need to focus on making sure that Casey is also happy, which means Casey must have the item they want (I2). 

Here's the completed story:

1. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the item they want (I2).
   - This action is necessary because I2 is located in the dining room, and Casey needs to be in the same room to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the dining room.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to obtain the item they want, which will make them happy.

3. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room where Alex and Blake are.
   - This action is necessary to reunite with Alex and Blake after picking up the chocolates.

4. **give(C2, I2, C3, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake.
   - This action is necessary because Blake wants to make Casey happy, and by giving the chocolates to Blake, Casey can ensure that Blake is happy as well.

5. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I2) back to Casey.
   - This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, thus making Casey happy.

Now, all characters are happy: Alex has I1, Casey has I2, and Blake has I3.
