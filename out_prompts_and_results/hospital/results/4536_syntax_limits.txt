In this story, we will focus on ensuring that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomB to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because understanding Jones's symptoms is crucial for providing the correct treatment. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but we will proceed with the assessment.

2. **Treat Jones**: Based on the assessment, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to check on Ross and Young. This action is not directly related to Jones's health but is necessary for Hathaway to manage the other patients and ensure they are also treated.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones** is the first step to determine his condition, which is critical for the next action.
- **Treating Jones** is the action that directly leads to Jones's health improvement, fulfilling his goal of being alive and healthy.
- **Walking to Admissions** allows Hathaway to continue their responsibilities as a doctor, ensuring that all patients are accounted for and treated.
