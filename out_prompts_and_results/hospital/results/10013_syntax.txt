To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Young has in order to treat them correctly.

2. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway will treat them with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room B**: Next, Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary for the same reason as assessing Young.

4. **Treat Ross with Steroids**: If Ross is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway will treat him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to ensure that Jones is also treated correctly.

6. **Treat Jones with Antibiotics or Steroids**: Depending on the diagnosis, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment. If Jones has Flaze, he will receive antibiotics; if he has Jarkis, he will receive steroids. This will ensure that Jones becomes healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to treat all patients correctly and achieve their goal of making them healthy.
