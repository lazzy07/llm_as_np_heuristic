To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Hathaway will assess Ross in PatientRoomC to determine his symptoms. This is necessary because Hathaway needs to know what disease Ross has in order to treat him correctly.

2. **Treat Ross**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms identified. If Ross has a rash, he will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will make him healthy.

3. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will then assess Young, who is currently in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine Young's symptoms and ensure he receives the correct treatment.

4. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified. If Young has a fever, he will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, which will also make him healthy.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
