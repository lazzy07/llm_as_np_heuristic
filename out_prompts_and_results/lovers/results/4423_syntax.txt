To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake ends up with the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). Since Casey is already happy with the chocolates (I2), we can focus on helping Alex and Blake.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room to pick up the item they want (I1).
2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers (I1) from the dining room.
3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room to be with Blake and Casey.
4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the flowers (I1) to Blake, which makes Blake happy because they now have the item they want (I3).
5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to pick up the jewelry (I3).
6. **pick_up(C2, I3, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry (I3) from the dining room.

Now, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I3).
