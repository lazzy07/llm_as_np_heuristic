Dr. Hathaway, realizing that Young is experiencing a fever, decides to treat Young for Flaze. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but the urgency of treating Young outweighs that risk. 

1. Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze with antibiotics. This action is necessary because Young has a fever, which is a symptom of Flaze. Treating Young correctly will ensure that Young becomes healthy.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2, and Young becomes healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is still in Admissions. Since Ross's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway must determine if Ross has Flaze or Jarkis. 

2. Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room A to Admissions to assess Ross. This action is necessary to understand Ross's condition and provide appropriate treatment.

3. Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross and discovers he has a rash, indicating Jarkis. This assessment is crucial for determining the correct treatment for Ross.

4. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis with steroids. This action is necessary because it matches Ross's symptoms, ensuring that Ross becomes healthy.

With both Young and Ross treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway has achieved the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
