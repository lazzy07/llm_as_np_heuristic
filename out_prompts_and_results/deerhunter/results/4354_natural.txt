To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle and can eliminate the clerk to take the money.)
3. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** (After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk is the only character with money.
- **Shoot the clerk:** This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, making it possible for him to take the money without any opposition.
- **Pick up the money:** This final action ensures that Bubba achieves his goal of having money.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.",
    "Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively leads to Bubba having the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
