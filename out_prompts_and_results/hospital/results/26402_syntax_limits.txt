In this story, we need to ensure that Jones, a hospital patient, achieves their goal of being alive and healthy. Given the current situation, Hathaway, the doctor, has a workload of 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake when assessing or treating patients. However, we can still achieve the goal with careful actions.

1. **Assess Jones**: Hathaway will assess Jones in PatientRoomC to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because identifying the correct symptoms will allow Hathaway to provide the appropriate treatment. Since Jones is currently in PatientRoomC, Hathaway can assess them without needing to walk.

2. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat them based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, they will be treated for Flaze with antibiotics, leading to Jones becoming healthy. If they have a rash, they will be treated for Jarkis with steroids, which will also lead to Jones becoming healthy.

By taking these two actions, Jones will achieve their goal of being alive and healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess(Jones)**: This action is necessary to determine the correct treatment for Jones. Without assessing, Hathaway cannot know what disease Jones has.
- **Treat(Jones)**: This action is essential to ensure that Jones receives the correct treatment based on the assessment, leading to their recovery.
