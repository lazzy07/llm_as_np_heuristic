In this story, Zoe and the Lizard are on the surface of the planet, both wanting to be healthy and safe while also seeking friendship. However, the environment is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. 

To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and one character dies, while also allowing for the possibility of friendship, the following actions will take place:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: This action is necessary to initiate the eruption of the volcano, which is a critical part of the story's climax. It sets the stage for the impending danger that both characters will face.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: This action allows Zoe and the Lizard to become friends despite the dangerous situation. It shows that even in the face of danger, they can find common ground and support each other.

3. **erupt(Surface)**: This action concludes the story with the volcano erupting, which results in the death of one character. Since both characters are on the surface when the eruption occurs, it leads to the demise of one of them.

In this case, the final action will result in Zoe dying, as she is the one who teleports back and forth, putting herself in danger. The Lizard, having made peace with Zoe, may have a chance to escape or survive.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano starts to erupt, creating an immediate threat to both characters.
2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe and the Lizard decide to put aside their differences and become friends, which is a crucial moment of connection.
3. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, leading to Zoe's death, fulfilling the requirement of the story's ending.
