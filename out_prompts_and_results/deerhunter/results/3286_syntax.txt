To achieve Bubba's goal of getting money, the following actions will be taken:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, feeling greedy and hungry, decides to use the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain the money from the clerk, as the clerk has money and Bubba believes that shooting the clerk will allow him to take it.

2. **eat(Bubba, Clerk, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can eat the clerk's body. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger, which is a priority since he is currently hungry.

3. **decide_to_get_money(Bubba)**: Finally, Bubba will take the money from the clerk after eating. This action is implicit in the previous actions, as Bubba's goal is to have money, and he will naturally take it after the clerk is dead.

The story is short and direct, focusing on Bubba's immediate needs and desires, leading to a grim but effective resolution of his goals.
