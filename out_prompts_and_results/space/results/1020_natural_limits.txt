Zoe, realizing the danger the Lizard is in on the surface, decides to help. She teleports from the ship to the surface of the planet. Upon arrival, she sees the Lizard struggling with the erupting volcano. Instead of fighting, Zoe approaches the Lizard and offers her assistance. The Lizard, surprised but grateful, accepts her help. They work together to find a safe path away from the volcano, and in doing so, they form a bond of friendship. 

Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard, who is now no longer alone in facing the dangers of the planet.
