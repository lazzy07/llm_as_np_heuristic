**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Young in Patient Room A. 

1. **Assess Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Jarkis (the rash disease) instead of Flaze (the fever disease). 

2. **Treat Young in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess the remaining patients, Jones and Ross.

4. **Admit Jones to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B, increasing her workload again.

5. **Assess Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Jarkis.

6. **Treat Ross in Patient Room C**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

7. **Walk to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway walks to Patient Room B to assess Jones.

8. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown condition. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes Jones has Jarkis.

9. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, thinking it is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions, despite her mistakes, lead to the conclusion that all patients are now deceased. However, her goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy is not achieved, as she mistakenly treated them all incorrectly.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Assessing Young and Ross was necessary to determine their conditions, but due to the high workload, mistakes were made.
- Treating Young, Ross, and Jones was necessary to attempt to cure them, but the incorrect treatments led to their demise.
- Walking between rooms was necessary for Dr. Hathaway to manage her patients and assess them properly.
