To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on the assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has Flaze, they will receive antibiotics; if they have Jarkis, they will receive steroids. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

Hereâ€™s the complete story with explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine their symptoms. This is essential because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.
