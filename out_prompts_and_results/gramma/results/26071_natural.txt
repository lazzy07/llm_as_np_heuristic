To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit walks from the market to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to move closer to the chest where her coins are stored.

2. **The bandit loots the medicine from the corpse of the merchant.**  
   - The bandit takes the medicine from the merchant's corpse, which she can later use to negotiate or trade for coins.

3. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the medicine and any coins she has.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at her camp.

The story is concise and focuses on the bandit’s actions to achieve her goal without unnecessary interactions with other characters, as they are not relevant to her objective.
