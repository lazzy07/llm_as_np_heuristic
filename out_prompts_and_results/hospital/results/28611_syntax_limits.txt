To ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to identify Ross's condition.

2. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat him with antibiotics. If Ross has Flaze (which is likely given the context), this treatment will make him healthy.

Here’s the complete story with explanations:

1. **Assess(Ross)**: Hathaway assesses Ross in Exam Room A to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision. Given that Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of misdiagnosis, but it is essential to proceed with the assessment to help Ross.

2. **Treat(Ross, Antibiotics)**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics. If Ross has Flaze, this treatment will cure him. This action is crucial for Hathaway to achieve their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can potentially make Ross healthy, which contributes to their overall goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
