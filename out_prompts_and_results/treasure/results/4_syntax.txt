After Hawkins and Silver arrive on the island, Hawkins knows that the treasure is buried nearby. To achieve his goal of obtaining the treasure, he decides to dig it up. Since Silver believes the treasure is buried on the island, he will not oppose Hawkins's actions.

1. **dig()**: Hawkins digs up the treasure. This action is necessary because it allows Hawkins to access the treasure that he desires.

2. **take(Hawkins, Treasure)**: Hawkins takes the treasure. This action is the final step in achieving his goal of obtaining the treasure.

The story is short and straightforward because Hawkins only needs to dig and take the treasure to achieve his goal. Silver's belief that the treasure is on the island means he will not interfere with Hawkins's actions.

Here is the final plan in JSON format:
