To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The current situation indicates that Bubba already has 1 money, so he does not need to take any further actions to achieve his goal. However, we need to ensure that the story concludes with Bubba's goal being clearly stated and achieved.

Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Bubba looks at the clerk.** (This action is necessary to establish the interaction between Bubba and the clerk.)
2. **Bubba decides to leave the bank.** (Bubba has achieved his goal of having 1 money and does not need to interact further with the clerk.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba leaves the bank to return to a safe location.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully achieved his goal of having 1 money and has left the bank.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Bubba looks at the clerk:** This establishes the context of the interaction and confirms that Bubba is aware of the clerk's presence.
- **Bubba decides to leave the bank:** Since Bubba has already achieved his goal of having 1 money, he decides to exit the bank without further conflict.
- **Bubba goes from the bank to the house:** This action signifies that Bubba is moving to a safe place after achieving his goal.
