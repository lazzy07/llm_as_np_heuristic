To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want (I1). The following actions will help accomplish this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the item they want to pick it up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates. This is essential for Alex to have the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room where Casey and Blake are. This is necessary to interact with them and ensure they are aware of Alex's happiness.

4. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates to Casey. This action is important because it helps Casey to be happy, which in turn aligns with Alex's goal of being happy.

5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to pick up the jewelry (I1) that Alex wants. This is necessary for Casey to fulfill their own desire to make Blake happy.

6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the jewelry. This is essential for Casey to have the item they want.

7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room with the jewelry. This is necessary to complete the exchange.

8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions in a JSON object:
