Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room B, recognizes that Ross is experiencing a fever, which indicates he has Flaze. To ensure Ross becomes healthy, Hathaway decides to treat him with antibiotics. This action will reduce Hathaway's workload by one and help Ross recover.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks back to the admissions room to admit Young, who is currently experiencing unknown symptoms. Since Young is in the admissions room, Hathaway can assign him to Patient Room C, which has not yet been assigned. This action increases Hathaway's workload by one.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Since Young's symptoms are unknown, Hathaway cannot determine the disease at this moment. However, since Young is still alive, he can be treated later once his symptoms are identified.

The sequence of actions ensures that Ross is treated successfully, achieving Hathaway's goal of making patients healthy. 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:
