 I will describe a setting and the first part of a story. Your job is to complete the story to ensure it has a specific ending. 

There are two locations in this story: the port and the island. There is one item in this story: some treasure. There are two characters in this story. Hawkins is a boy who wants the treasure. Silver is a pirate who wants the treasure. There are four kinds of actions characters can take in the story. If the treasure is buried on the island, Hawkins can spread a rumor that will make Silver believe the treasure is buried on the island. Hawkins and Silver can work together to sail a ship from the port to the island. If the treasure is buried on the island, Hawkins can dig up the treasure. A character can take the treasure once it has been dug up.

 


 These events have already happened in the story: 
Hawkins spreads a rumor that the treasure is buried on the island.Hawkins and Silver sail from Port Royal to the island.Hawkins digs up the treasure.Hawkins takes the treasure.


 This is the current situation after those events:
Hawkins is at the island.  Silver is at the island.  Hawkins has the treasure.  Silver believes that Hawkins has the treasure.  


 Complete the story using only these locations, items, characters, and actions. Do not invent new locations, items, characters, or actions. Characters should only take actions that help to achieve their goals, and the story should only include actions which are necessary to achieve the ending. Give me the shortest story 

that ends with Hawkins having the treasure.


 Explain why each action is in the story. After the explanation of the whole story, give a JSON object with the final plan. The JSON should include an array called 'plan' with the sequence of actions (as a string) taken to achieve the goal. Example format: {plan: ['action1', 'action2', 'action3']}.

 While keeping the story complete, a smaller story is preferred. Suggested maximum number of the actions in the story: 1.
