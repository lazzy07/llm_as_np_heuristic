Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway, with a workload of 2, is still able to accurately assess him without making a mistake. Upon assessment, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C, as he is still waiting there. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are attended to and to reduce the workload further.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is also experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway assesses him and discovers he has a rash, indicating he has Jarkis. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis, making him healthy as well.

With both Jones and Ross treated successfully, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
