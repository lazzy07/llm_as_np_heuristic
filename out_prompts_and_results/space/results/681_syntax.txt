To complete the story, we need to ensure that the characters can achieve their goals while also leading to the eruption of the volcano, which will ultimately result in one character dying. The goal is to have Zoe and the Lizard become friends before the eruption occurs.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to this outcome:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe and the Lizard are currently in the same location and not fighting. Zoe wants to make friends, and the Lizard also desires friendship. This action allows them to establish a friendly relationship, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: After making peace, the volcano erupts. Since the surface is already deemed dangerous, this action will lead to the demise of one character who is on the surface.

3. **kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since Zoe is now friends with the Lizard, she will sacrifice herself to save the Lizard from the eruption. This action results in Zoe dying, fulfilling the requirement of a character dying while also ensuring that the Lizard is safe.

The actions are chosen to ensure that both characters achieve their goals of friendship and safety, while also leading to the eruption of the volcano and the death of Zoe.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)",
    "erupt(Surface)",
    "kill(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively concludes the story with the desired outcomes.
