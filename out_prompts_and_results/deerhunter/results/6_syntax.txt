To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and go to the bank where the clerk is located. This is necessary for Bubba to confront the clerk and attempt to get the money.

2. **load(Bubba, Rifle, Ammo)**: Once at the bank, Bubba loads the rifle with the ammunition he picked up earlier. This action is crucial as it prepares him to threaten the bank clerk.

3. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba then shoots the bank clerk. This action is taken to eliminate the clerk and take the money without resistance.

4. **pickup(Bubba, Money, Bank)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba picks up the money from the bank. This action fulfills the goal of Bubba having the money.

The story is concise and directly leads to the desired outcome. Each action is necessary to either achieve Bubba's greed for money or to ensure Bambi's survival is not a concern since the focus is on Bubba's actions.
