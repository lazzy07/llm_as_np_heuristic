To ensure that all patients become healthy, Hathaway must assess and treat each patient correctly. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if they assess a patient. Therefore, the best course of action is to treat the patients directly based on their assigned rooms without assessing them first. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions:

1. **Walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway moves to the room where Jones is assigned. This is necessary to treat Jones.
2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics. Since Jones has not shown any symptoms yet, we assume they have Flaze, which is treatable with antibiotics. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.
3. **Walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway moves to the room where Ross is assigned. This is necessary to treat Ross.
4. **Treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics. We assume Ross also has Flaze, which is treatable with antibiotics. This action is crucial for Ross to become healthy.
5. **Walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway moves back to the room where Young is assigned. This is necessary to treat Young.
6. **Treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics. We assume Young has Flaze as well. This action is crucial for Young to become healthy.

By treating all patients with antibiotics, Hathaway ensures that all patients recover from Flaze, achieving their goal of making all patients healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking**: Necessary to reach each patient in their assigned exam rooms.
- **Treating**: Essential to provide the correct treatment based on the assumption that all patients have Flaze, which is treatable with antibiotics.
