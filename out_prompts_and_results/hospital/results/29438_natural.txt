**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, realizing that her workload is high and she needs to assess the patients to determine their conditions, decides to first assess Jones in Patient Room B. 

1. **Assess Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Jones has Jarkis instead of Flaze. 

2. **Treat Jones in Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. However, since Jones actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Jones dies.

3. **Walk to Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room A to assess Ross.

4. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross, who is also experiencing an unknown symptom. Again, due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Ross has Jarkis.

5. **Treat Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Ross actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Ross dies.

6. **Walk to Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Young.

7. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Young, who is experiencing an unknown symptom. Due to her high workload, she mistakenly believes that Young has Jarkis.

8. **Treat Young in Admissions**: Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing it to be the correct treatment for Jarkis. Since Young actually has Flaze, this treatment fails, and Young dies.

Despite the mistakes made due to her high workload, Dr. Hathaway has assessed and treated all patients, achieving her goal of ensuring that all patients are attended to, even if the outcomes were tragic.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each assessment and treatment was necessary to fulfill Dr. Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy, even though the outcomes were not as intended due to her workload.
- The walking actions were necessary to move between the locations to assess and treat each patient.
