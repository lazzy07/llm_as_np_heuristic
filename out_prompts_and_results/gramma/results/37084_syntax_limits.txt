To achieve Tom's goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, the following action is necessary:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The merchant is currently at the crossroads and has the medicine. She needs to walk to the market to sell her items, which will allow Tom to buy the medicine from her.

2. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom, who is at the market, can now buy the medicine from the merchant using one of the coins he is carrying. This action allows Tom to acquire the medicine he desires.

3. **walk(Tom, Market, Cottage)**: After purchasing the medicine, Tom can walk back to the cottage, achieving his goal of being at the cottage with the medicine.

The actions are necessary because:
- Tom needs to buy the medicine from the merchant, who must be at the market to facilitate the transaction.
- After acquiring the medicine, Tom must return to the cottage to fulfill his goal.
