Zoe, having just arrived at the cave on the planet's surface, sees the Lizard, the guardian of the planet. Both characters are safe and healthy, but they have not yet established a friendship. Zoe knows that the volcano is beginning to erupt, making the surface dangerous, and she wants to ensure both her safety and that of the Lizard while also making a friend.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and extends a hand of friendship, expressing her desire to be friends and work together for their mutual safety. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After successfully making peace, Zoe suggests they both leave the cave to find a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary to ensure their safety as the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous.

3. **walk(Lizard, Cave, Surface)**: The Lizard, now a friend of Zoe, follows her lead and walks out of the cave to the surface. This action reinforces their new friendship and ensures they are both moving to safety together.

4. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Finally, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety from the erupting volcano. The Lizard, now a friend, is left safe on the surface, and Zoe can monitor the situation from her ship.

By completing these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
