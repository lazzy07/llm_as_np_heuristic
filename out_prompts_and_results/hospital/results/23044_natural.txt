**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room B. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are seen. 

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room B. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Hathaway still cannot identify the disease, but he is now aware of both patients' conditions.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 4, but it is essential to ensure Young is also treated.

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C. Young is experiencing Unknown symptoms as well. At this point, Hathaway has assessed all patients, but he still cannot identify their diseases.

To ensure all patients are treated, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, this treatment is a gamble. However, it is necessary to attempt to make him healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room B with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Again, this is a gamble due to the Unknown symptoms.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Young in Patient Room C with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. This is also a gamble.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway's actions lead to the following outcomes: Jones and Young become healthy, while Ross dies due to the incorrect treatment. Despite the loss, Dr. Hathaway achieves his goal of treating the patients.
