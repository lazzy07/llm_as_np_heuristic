To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following action is necessary:

1. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory needs to travel to the cave where Gargax is located. This is essential because Gargax has the potential to eat Rory, which would not help Rory achieve their goal. However, since Rory is currently in the village and needs to be in the cave to interact with Gargax, this action is necessary.

2. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax, who is in the cave, will eat Rory. This action is crucial because it allows Rory to become wealthy through the treasure they possess. Although it seems counterintuitive, in this story's context, being eaten by Gargax will lead to Rory's wealth being transferred to Gargax, which aligns with Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry. 

After these actions, Rory will not be alive anymore, but they will have achieved their goal of being wealthy (through the treasure) and not hungry (as they will no longer be alive). 

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "travel(Rory, Village, Cave)",
    "eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: This action is necessary for Rory to reach the cave where Gargax is located, setting up the next action.
- **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: This action fulfills Gargax's desire to eat and allows Rory to achieve their goal of wealth, even if it results in Rory's demise.
