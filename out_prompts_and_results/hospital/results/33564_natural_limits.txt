Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A to determine their symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in the room, Dr. Hathaway can focus on them without the risk of making a mistake due to workload. After assessing Young, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Young has a fever, indicating they have Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, successfully curing them. 

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Jones to Patient Room C. Since Jones is still in Admissions and has not been assessed yet, Dr. Hathaway can assign them to a room without increasing their workload significantly. 

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room C and finds that Jones has a rash, indicating they have Jarkis. Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with steroids, successfully curing them as well.

With both Young and Jones treated and healthy, Dr. Hathaway achieves their goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
