After the villain bribes the President with Money, the President, now under the villain's control, decides to take further action to solidify the villain's power. The President, wanting to maintain his position and fearing the villain's influence, coerces the hero into wanting the villain to have Money. The hero, feeling the pressure from the President, reluctantly agrees to this arrangement.

The villain, now fully in control of the President, uses this leverage to ensure that the President continues to support his plans. The villain's control over the President is now complete, as the President acts in the villain's interest, ensuring that the villain's goals are met.
