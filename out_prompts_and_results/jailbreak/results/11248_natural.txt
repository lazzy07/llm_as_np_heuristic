**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the laundry room and is threatened by the bully. To ensure Ernest's safety and to secure his own escape, Roy decides to take action.

2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This prevents the bully from coming out and threatening Ernest while Roy is trying to help him.)
3. **Roy goes to the laundry room.** (Roy needs to reach Ernest to inform him of the plan and ensure they can escape together.)
4. **Roy tells Ernest to put on the civilian clothes.** (This is crucial for Ernest to disguise himself and escape with Roy.)
5. **Ernest puts on the civilian clothes.** (Now both characters are disguised and can safely escape.)
6. **Roy and Ernest sneak through the vent to the highway.** (This is the final step to escape the prison together.)
