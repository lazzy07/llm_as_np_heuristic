Zoe stands on the surface, aware of the danger surrounding her due to the erupting volcano. She knows she needs to make a connection with the Lizard to ensure both of their safety. Instead of fighting, she decides to approach the Lizard peacefully.

1. **Zoe makes peace with the Lizard.** This action is crucial because it allows Zoe and the Lizard to establish a friendly relationship, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy. By making peace, they can work together to find a solution to the dangerous situation on the surface.

2. **Zoe and the Lizard walk to the cave.** This action is necessary for both characters to escape the erupting surface and find safety in the cave. The cave serves as a refuge from the volcanic activity, ensuring that both Zoe and the Lizard can remain healthy and safe.

By taking these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
