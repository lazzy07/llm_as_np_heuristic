Dr. Hathaway, currently at Patient Room C with Jones, decides to assess Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway's assessment will help identify whether he has Flaze or Jarkis. After assessing, Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

With this information, Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Jones becomes healthy.
