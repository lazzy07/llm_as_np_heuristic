To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Rob Tom**: The bandit will rob Tom to take the coins he has. Since Tom is currently armed with a sword, this action is not possible. Therefore, the bandit will need to take a different approach.

2. **Attack Tom**: The bandit will attack Tom to kill him and loot his items. This is a necessary action because it allows the bandit to eliminate a threat and gain the coins Tom has.

3. **Loot Tom**: After Tom is killed, the bandit will loot Tom's body to take the coins he has. This will help the bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins.

4. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: Finally, the bandit will walk to the bandit camp to store the coins in the chest, ensuring that she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

Hereâ€™s the complete sequence of actions:

1. **Attack(Tom, Bandit, Market)**: The bandit attacks Tom, who is currently in the market. This action is necessary to eliminate Tom and take his items.
2. **Loot(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Market)**: The bandit loots Tom's body to take the coins he was carrying. This action helps the bandit achieve her goal of carrying more coins.
3. **Walk(Bandit, Market, Camp)**: The bandit walks to the bandit camp to store the coins in the chest. This action ensures that the bandit has coins in the chest, fulfilling her goal.
