Dr. Hathaway, determined to ensure all patients are healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room A.** (This action assigns Jones to an exam room, allowing Hathaway to assess him later. It also increases Hathaway's workload to 3.)
2. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.** (Hathaway checks Young's symptoms. Since Young is the only patient in Room A, Hathaway can accurately assess him.)
3. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Flaze.** (Assuming Young has a fever, Hathaway treats him with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy, and Hathaway's workload decreases to 2.)
4. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C.** (Hathaway checks Ross's symptoms. Since Ross is the only patient in Room C, Hathaway can accurately assess him.)
5. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Jarkis.** (Assuming Ross has a rash, Hathaway treats him with steroids, which is the correct treatment for Jarkis. Ross becomes healthy, and Hathaway's workload decreases to 1.)

At this point, both Young and Ross are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all hospital patients are healthy.
