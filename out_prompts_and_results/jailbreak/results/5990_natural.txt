**Story Completion:**

As day one continues, Roy finishes his chores in the laundry room. Knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he is threatened, he decides to take a risk. He sneaks into the kitchen and steals the knife, knowing it could be his only chance to defend himself and Ernest.

With the knife in hand, Roy moves to the hallway, where he can hear the bully's laughter echoing from the gym. He locks the gym door, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. 

Now, with the knife ready, Roy enters the gym. The bully, surprised and enraged, lunges at Roy. But Roy is prepared; he fights back and kills the bully, finally freeing himself and Ernest from the threat.

With the bully dead, Roy quickly searches the gym and finds the pack of cigarettes that the bully had hidden. He takes the cigarettes and heads back to the hallway. 

Roy then puts on the civilian clothes he had seen in the laundry room earlier, disguising himself. He crawls through the vents to the highway outside the prison, where he can finally escape.
