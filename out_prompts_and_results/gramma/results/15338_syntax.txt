To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **walk(Bandit, Market, Crossroads)**: The Bandit is currently at the Market after attacking the Merchant. She needs to move to the Crossroads to access the path to the Bandit Camp.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit will then walk from the Crossroads to the Bandit Camp, where she can store her coins.

3. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: Finally, the Bandit will take the coins from her possession and place them in the chest at the Bandit Camp, ensuring she has achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.

### Explanation of Actions:
- The first action is necessary for the Bandit to leave the Market, where she is currently located, and head towards the Crossroads, which is a junction to other locations.
- The second action allows the Bandit to reach her preferred location, the Bandit Camp, where she can safely store her coins.
- The third action is crucial as it fulfills the Bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at the Bandit Camp.
