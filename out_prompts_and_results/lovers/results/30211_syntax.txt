To achieve Blake's goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy, we need to focus on the items they want. Blake wants to make Alex happy, who wants the jewelry (I1). Since Casey has the jewelry (I1) and is currently unhappy, Blake can help by facilitating a trade between Casey and Alex.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)**: Blake tells Alex that Casey wants the chocolates (I2). This is a lie, but it sets up the next action by creating a false belief in Alex that Casey is interested in the chocolates, which can lead to a trade.
   
2. **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) to find Casey and discuss the trade.

3. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake follows Alex to the dining room to facilitate the trade.

4. **tell(C3, C2, I1, R12)**: Blake tells Casey that Alex wants the jewelry (I1). This is true and encourages Casey to consider trading.

5. **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R12)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I1) with Alex for the chocolates (I2). Now, Alex has the jewelry they wanted, making them happy.

6. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves back to the living room to be with Blake.

7. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room as well.

At this point, Alex is happy because they have the jewelry (I1), and Blake is happy because they helped Alex achieve their goal. Casey is still unhappy because they wanted the chocolates (I2), but Blake's goal of making Alex happy is achieved.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)",
    "move(C1, R22, R12)",
    "move(C3, R22, R12)",
    "tell(C3, C2, I1, R12)",
    "trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R12)",
    "move(C1, R12, R22)",
    "move(C2, R12, R22)"
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Actions:
- **tell(C3, C1, I2, R22)**: Sets up a false belief to encourage a trade.
- **move(C1, R22, R12)**: Alex moves to engage with Casey.
- **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake follows to facilitate the trade.
- **tell(C3, C2, I1, R12)**: Blake tells Casey the truth to encourage the trade.
- **trade(C2, I1, C1, I2, R12)**: The key action where the trade occurs, making Alex happy.
- **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex returns to be with Blake.
- **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room, completing the scene. 

This sequence ensures that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy while navigating the dynamics of the other characters.
