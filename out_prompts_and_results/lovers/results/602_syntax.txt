To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room where the chocolates (I2) are located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to potentially trade or give items.

2. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating a potential trade or exchange of items.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This is crucial because it allows Casey to give Alex the flowers, which is what Alex wants.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room with the chocolates. This is necessary for Casey to be able to give the flowers to Alex.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.
