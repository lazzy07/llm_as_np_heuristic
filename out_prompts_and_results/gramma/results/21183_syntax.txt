To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to navigate the current situation strategically. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Market.** 
   - This action is necessary for Tom to confront the Bandit and Merchant, as they are both at the Market.

2. **Tom reports the location of the Bandit to the Guard.**
   - By reporting the Bandit, Tom ensures that the Guard will take action against the Bandit, which will help clear the way for Tom to safely carry the medicine back to the cottage.

3. **The Guard attacks the Bandit.**
   - This action is a direct consequence of Tom's report. The Guard, being armed, will attack the Bandit, which is necessary to eliminate the threat.

4. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.**
   - After the Bandit is dealt with, Tom can safely return to the Crossroads.

5. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.**
   - Finally, Tom walks to the Cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to Market:** Tom needs to be where the action is happening to influence the outcome.
- **Reporting the Bandit:** This is a strategic move to ensure the Guard can act against the Bandit, who poses a threat to Tom and his goal.
- **Guard attacking the Bandit:** This action removes the Bandit from the equation, allowing Tom to proceed without fear of being robbed or attacked.
- **Walking back to Crossroads:** This is a necessary step to get back on the path to the Cottage.
- **Walking to Cottage:** This final action completes Tom's goal of being at the Cottage with the medicine.
