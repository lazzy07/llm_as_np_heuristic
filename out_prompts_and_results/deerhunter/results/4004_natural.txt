To complete the story, Bubba needs to acquire money from the bank clerk. Since Bubba has a rifle and the clerk is at the bank, Bubba can use the rifle to intimidate the clerk into giving him the money. Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Bubba achieving his goal of having 1 money:

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.** - This action is necessary because Bubba wants to ensure he can take the money without resistance. The clerk believes Bubba has the rifle, so this action aligns with Bubba's goal of acquiring money.

2. **Bubba picks up the money from the clerk.** - After shooting the clerk, Bubba can take the money directly from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Shoot the clerk:** This action eliminates the threat from the clerk and allows Bubba to take the money without any opposition.
- **Pick up the money:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of acquiring 1 money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba shoots the clerk with the rifle.",
    "Bubba picks up the money from the clerk."
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Bubba successfully achieves his goal of having 1 money while adhering to the constraints of the story.
