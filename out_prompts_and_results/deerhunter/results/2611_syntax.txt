Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest after having shot and eaten Bambi, and he is aware that the bank clerk has money. The next logical step for Bubba is to go back to the bank and steal the money from the clerk.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba decides to return to the bank where the clerk is located. This action is necessary for him to confront the clerk and attempt to steal the money.

2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once Bubba arrives at the bank, he uses his loaded rifle to threaten the clerk and steal the money. This action is crucial as it allows Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba needs to return to the bank to access the clerk and the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle to intimidate the clerk and successfully takes the money.
