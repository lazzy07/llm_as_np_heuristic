In this story, Vince's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, he needs to acquire the treasure located in the cave, as he already has some money. 

Here's the completed story:

1. Vince travels from the cave to the village. (This action is necessary for Vince to reach Talia and Rory, who are at the village, and to discuss his plans with them.)
2. Vince proposes to Talia. (This action is necessary for Vince to increase his happiness, as marrying Talia will make him happy.)
3. Talia accepts Vince's proposal. (This action is necessary for Talia to reciprocate Vince's feelings, leading to both characters being happy.)
4. Vince and Talia get married. (This action solidifies their relationship, ensuring Vince's happiness.)
5. Vince travels back to the cave with Talia. (This action is necessary for Vince to access the treasure.)
6. Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. (This action is necessary for Vince to achieve his goal of wealth.)

After these actions, Vince is happy (due to his marriage to Talia), wealthy (due to acquiring the treasure), and not hungry (as he has not become hungry during the story).
