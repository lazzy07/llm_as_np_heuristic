To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he is currently at the forest with a loaded rifle. Here’s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - This action is necessary for Bubba to confront the bank clerk and attempt to take the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having 1 money.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going from the forest to the bank** is essential because Bubba needs to be in the same location as the clerk to interact with him and take the money.
- **Stealing the money from the clerk** is the action that directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining 1 money.

With these two actions, Bubba successfully achieves his goal.
