Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is alive and Dr. Hathaway's workload is 2, there is no risk of making a mistake. After assessing, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Jones has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. Dr. Hathaway then treats Jones with antibiotics, successfully curing him.

Next, Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment. 

In summary, the actions taken are:
1. Assess Jones in Patient Room A to identify his symptoms.
2. Treat Jones with antibiotics to cure him of Flaze.
3. Admit Ross to Patient Room C to ensure he can be treated.

With these actions, Dr. Hathaway achieves the goal of ensuring that all patients are healthy.
