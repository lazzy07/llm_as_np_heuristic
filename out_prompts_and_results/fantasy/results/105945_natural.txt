3. **Talia and Vince travel to the cave**: Talia and Vince, who are at the village, will travel to the cave to confront Gargax. This action is necessary for them to understand what has happened to Rory and to potentially reclaim the treasure.

4. **Talia proposes to Gargax**: Talia, wanting to ensure her own happiness and wealth, proposes to Gargax. This action is strategic as it may lead to a partnership that could benefit both parties.

5. **Gargax accepts Talia's proposal**: Gargax accepts Talia's proposal, which makes Talia happy. This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of happiness.

6. **Talia and Gargax get married**: This final action solidifies the partnership between Talia and Gargax, ensuring Talia's happiness while also allowing Gargax to maintain his wealth.
