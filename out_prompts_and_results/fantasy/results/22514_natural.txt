To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Rory travels from the village to the cave.** - Rory needs to go to the cave to access the treasure, which is essential for achieving wealth.

2. **Rory picks up the treasure at the cave.** - By picking up the treasure, Rory will increase their wealth, which is one of their goals.

3. **Rory travels from the cave to the village.** - Rory needs to return to the village to be in a safe location and to potentially interact with Talia.

4. **Rory proposes marriage to Talia.** - Since Talia is now alone and Rory is back in the village, he can propose to her, which will lead to both of them being happy.

5. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal.** - Talia accepts the proposal, which fulfills the requirement for both characters to be happy.

6. **Rory and Talia get married.** - This finalizes their relationship, ensuring Rory's happiness.
