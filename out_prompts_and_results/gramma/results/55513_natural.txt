The bandit, having just attacked the hero and the merchant, now stands at the market with the hero's coin and the merchant's sword. The guard is also present, armed and vigilant. The banditâ€™s goal is to carry as many coins as possible or to have coins in the chest at the bandit camp. 

To achieve this, the bandit will take the following actions:

1. **Rob the Merchant**: The bandit uses her sword to rob the merchant, taking the medicine. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to gain an item of value that can be sold or used for leverage, even though the merchant is dead. 

2. **Loot the Merchant's Corpse**: The bandit loots the merchant's corpse to take the medicine. This action is necessary to ensure the bandit has the medicine, which can be valuable or useful.

3. **Walk to the Bandit Camp**: The bandit then walks to the bandit camp, where she can store her coins and the medicine. This action is necessary to fulfill her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

4. **Place the Hero's Coin in the Chest**: Once at the bandit camp, the bandit places the hero's coin in the chest. This action is necessary to achieve her goal of having coins in the chest.

Now, the bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
