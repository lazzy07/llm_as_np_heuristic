To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Assess Young in PatientRoomB**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is also necessary to ensure that Young receives the correct treatment.

3. **Walk Jones from Admissions to PatientRoomA**: Jones is currently in the admissions room. Hathaway needs to assess Jones as well, so Jones must be moved to an exam room.

4. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomA**: After walking Jones to PatientRoomA, Hathaway will assess him to determine his symptoms.

5. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as a fever (Flaze), Hathaway will treat Ross with antibiotics to make him healthy.

6. **Treat Young with steroids**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a rash (Jarkis), Hathaway will treat Young with steroids to make him healthy.

7. **Treat Jones with antibiotics**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's symptoms as a fever (Flaze), Hathaway will treat Jones with antibiotics to make him healthy.

Now, let's outline the actions taken and their explanations:

1. **assess(Hathaway, Ross, ?, PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's symptoms, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.
   
2. **assess(Hathaway, Young, ?, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine Young's symptoms, which is also crucial for providing the correct treatment.

3. **walk(Jones, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to move Jones to an exam room so that Hathaway can assess him.

4. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, ?, PatientRoomA)**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms, which is crucial for providing the correct treatment.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Ross, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's symptoms as Flaze, this action will make Ross healthy.

6. **treat(Hathaway, Young, steroids, PatientRoomB)**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as Jarkis, this action will make Young healthy.

7. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, antibiotics, PatientRoomA)**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Jones's symptoms as Flaze, this action will make Jones healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients are treated correctly and become healthy.
