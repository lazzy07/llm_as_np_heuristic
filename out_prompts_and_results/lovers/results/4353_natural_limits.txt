In the current situation, Alex is in the dining room and wants the flowers, which are with Blake in the living room. To achieve their goal, Alex needs to get the flowers from Blake. 

Here's the shortest story where Alex achieves their goal:

1. **Alex moves from the dining room to the living room.** (This action is necessary for Alex to reach Blake and the flowers.)
2. **Alex tells Blake that the flowers are wanted.** (This action is to confirm to Blake that Alex wants the flowers, which may prompt Blake to consider giving them up.)
3. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex.** (This action allows Alex to finally obtain the flowers, achieving their goal of happiness.)

After these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
