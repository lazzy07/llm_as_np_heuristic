Bubba, feeling hungry and wanting money, decides to take action in the forest where he is currently located. He spots Bambi, the deer, and sees an opportunity. 

1. **Bubba loads the ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary because Bubba needs a loaded gun to threaten or shoot Bambi.)
2. **Bubba shoots and kills Bambi.** (Bubba needs to eat, and killing Bambi will provide him with food.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** (After killing Bambi, Bubba can satisfy his hunger by eating the deer.)
4. **Bubba becomes greedy.** (After eating, Bubba's focus shifts to wanting money.)
5. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (Bubba wants to obtain money, so he needs to go to the bank where the clerk is located.)

After these actions, Bubba achieves his goal of having money by planning to steal it from the clerk once he arrives at the bank.
