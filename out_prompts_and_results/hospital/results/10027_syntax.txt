To complete the story, we need to ensure that Hathaway, the doctor, successfully treats all patients, leading to their health. Given the current situation, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room yet, Hathaway will first assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to understand what treatment he needs.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room B**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room B. This action is necessary to allow Hathaway to treat Ross.

3. **Assess Jones**: Next, Hathaway will assess Jones, who is still in the admissions room. This is necessary to determine his symptoms and the appropriate treatment.

4. **Admit Jones to Exam Room A**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room A. This allows Hathaway to treat Jones.

5. **Treat Young**: Young is already in Exam Room C. Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms assessed earlier.

6. **Treat Ross**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room B, Hathaway will treat him based on the symptoms assessed.
