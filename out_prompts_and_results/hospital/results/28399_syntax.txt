To ensure that Jones achieves their goal of being alive and healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Treat Jones based on the assessment**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. If Jones has a fever, he will be treated with antibiotics for Flaze. If he has a rash, he will be treated with steroids for Jarkis. This action is crucial for Jones to become healthy.

3. **Walk to Admissions**: After treating Jones, Hathaway will walk to the admissions room to check on Young, who is still waiting to be assigned to an exam room. This action is not directly related to Jones's health but is necessary for the overall hospital workflow.

4. **Admit Young to an exam room**: Hathaway will admit Young to an exam room to ensure he receives the necessary care. This action is important for the hospital's operation but does not affect Jones's immediate goal.

Now, let's outline the actions in the story:

1. **Assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: This action is necessary to determine Jones's condition.
2. **Treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: This action is essential for Jones to become healthy.
3. **Walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)**: This action allows Hathaway to check on other patients.
4. **Admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomA)**: This action ensures Young receives care.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assessing Jones**: This is the first step to understanding what Jones is suffering from, which is critical for effective treatment.
- **Treating Jones**: This is the action that directly leads to Jones's health improvement, fulfilling his goal.
- **Walking to Admissions**: While this does not directly impact Jones's health, it is part of Hathaway's responsibilities as a doctor to ensure all patients are attended to.
- **Admitting Young**: This action is part of the hospital's workflow and ensures that all patients are being cared for, maintaining the hospital's efficiency.

### Final Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)",
    "treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)",
    "walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, Admissions)",
    "admit(Hathaway, Young, PatientRoomA)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Jones achieves his goal of being alive and healthy while also maintaining the hospital's operations.
