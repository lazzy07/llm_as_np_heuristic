To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can take the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, uses the loaded rifle to shoot the bank clerk. This action allows Bubba to eliminate the clerk, who is the only one with money in the bank. 

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba can go to the forest where Bambi is located and eat her. This action fulfills Bubba's hunger and also results in Bambi being dead.

By taking these two actions, we ensure that Bubba ends up with the money from the clerk and also satisfies his hunger by eating Bambi.

### Explanation of Actions:

- **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger after the confrontation with the clerk. Eating Bambi also results in her death, fulfilling the condition of the story.
