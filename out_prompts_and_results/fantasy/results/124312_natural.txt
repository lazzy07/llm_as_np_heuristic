To ensure Rory achieves his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax, the dragon, wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure Rory has, which will fulfill Gargax's goal of wealth. Rory's happiness will not be achieved in this scenario, but it is the only way to ensure Gargax's hunger is satisfied.

2. **Gargax takes the treasure from Rory's body**: After eating Rory, Gargax can take the treasure that Rory had. This action is essential for Gargax to achieve wealth.

3. **Vince travels from the village to the cave**: Vince, who is alive, will travel to the cave to check on Talia and Rory. This action is necessary for Vince to be involved in the story and to potentially help Talia.

4. **Vince proposes to Talia**: Vince, who wants to be happy and not hungry, proposes to Talia. This action is necessary for Vince to pursue his goal of happiness.

5. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal**: Talia accepts Vince's proposal, which makes both of them happy. This action is necessary for Talia to achieve happiness, even though it does not directly contribute to Rory's goal.

6. **Vince and Talia get married**: This action solidifies the happiness of both Vince and Talia, ensuring that they are both content.

In this story, Rory does not achieve his goal of happiness, but Gargax achieves his goal of wealth by taking the treasure. The focus is on Gargax's needs, as Rory's actions lead to his demise.
