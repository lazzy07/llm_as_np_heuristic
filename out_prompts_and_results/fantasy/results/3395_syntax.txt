To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will lead to Rory's happiness and wealth while also ensuring he does not become hungry. 

Here's the completed story:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels back to the Village to be with Talia and Vince, as he needs to be in a location where he can interact with them and potentially propose marriage to Talia, which will increase his happiness.

2. **marry(Rory, Talia, Village)**: Rory marries Talia, which makes both of them happy. This action is crucial for Rory to achieve his happiness goal.

3. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the Money that is with Vince. This action is necessary for Rory to increase his wealth.

4. **get_hungry(Rory)**: Rory becomes hungry. This action is included to ensure that Rory's hunger status is updated, but it will not affect his goal since he will not be in a position to starve.

5. **travel(Rory, Village, Cave)**: Rory travels back to the Cave to be near Gargax, who may have the potential to help him with his hunger.

6. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action is included to fulfill the requirement of the story, but it is not necessary for Rory to achieve his goals since he has already married Talia and picked up the Money.

In this story, Rory achieves his goal of happiness through marriage with Talia and wealth by picking up the Money. The actions taken ensure that Rory's happiness and wealth are prioritized, even though he ultimately meets a tragic end.
