To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Jones in PatientRoomC**: Hathaway will assess Jones to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Jones has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment decision.

2. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomA**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine their symptoms. This is also necessary for the same reason as above.

3. **Assess Young in Admissions**: Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is important to ensure that all patients are evaluated and treated accordingly.

4. **Treat Jones with the appropriate treatment**: Based on the assessment of Jones, Hathaway will treat Jones with either antibiotics (if Jones has Flaze) or steroids (if Jones has Jarkis). This action is crucial for Jones's recovery.

5. **Treat Ross with the appropriate treatment**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will treat Ross with the correct treatment based on their symptoms. This is essential for Ross's recovery.

6. **Treat Young with the appropriate treatment**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on their assessment. This ensures that all patients receive the necessary care.

By following this sequence of actions, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
