To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex obtains the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex moves to the dining room (R12) where Casey is located. This is necessary for Alex to interact with Casey and potentially obtain the jewelry.

2. **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: Alex tells Casey that they want the jewelry. This is a strategic move to communicate their desire and potentially influence Casey's actions.

3. **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the jewelry to Alex. This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

4. **move(C1, R12, R11)**: Alex moves back to the bedroom (R11) after receiving the jewelry. This action is not strictly necessary for achieving happiness but can be seen as a way for Alex to settle back into their space after the exchange.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have obtained the jewelry they wanted.

### Explanation of Each Action:
- **move(C1, R11, R12)**: Alex needs to be in the same room as Casey to communicate and exchange items.
- **tell(C1, C2, I1, R12)**: This action is crucial for Alex to express their desire for the jewelry, which is necessary for Casey to understand what Alex wants.
- **give(C2, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the key action that allows Alex to obtain the jewelry, thus achieving their goal of happiness.
- **move(C1, R12, R11)**: While this action does not directly contribute to Alex's happiness, it represents a return to a personal space after achieving their goal.
