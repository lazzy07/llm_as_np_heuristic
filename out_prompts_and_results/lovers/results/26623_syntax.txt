To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The current situation shows that Alex (C1) is not happy, and they want I1, which is currently with Casey (C3). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Alex's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: Casey (C3) trades the jewelry (I1) they have for the chocolates (I3) that Alex (C1) has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want while giving Casey the chocolates, which they also want.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Casey (C3) will have the chocolates (I3) and will also be happy.
- Blake (C2) remains unhappy since they still want the item (I2) that is not in the current scenario, but since the goal is to make Alex happy, Blake's happiness is not a priority.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purpose:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)**: This action allows Alex to get the jewelry they want, fulfilling their goal of happiness.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C3, I1, C1, I3, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
