To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit will rob Tom, who is currently at the Crossroads and does not have a sword. This action allows the bandit to take the coins that Tom is carrying.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the bandit will walk back to the bandit camp, where she can store the coins in the chest.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves her goal of carrying coins.
