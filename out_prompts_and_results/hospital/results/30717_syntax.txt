To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomC**: Since Hathaway is currently in PatientRoomC and Ross is assigned there, Hathaway can assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis.

2. **Assess Young in Admissions**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway should walk to the Admissions room to assess Young, who is currently there. This will help determine Young's symptoms as well.

3. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (either antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis) to ensure he becomes healthy.

4. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results.

5. **Assess Jones in Admissions**: Finally, Hathaway will return to the Admissions room to assess Jones, who is still there. This is necessary to determine Jones's symptoms.

6. **Treat Jones**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment based on the assessment results.

By following these steps, Hathaway will be able to assess and treat all patients, ensuring they all become healthy.
