**Story Completion:**

Ernest, disguised in civilian clothes, is on the highway and feels a sense of freedom. He knows that Roy is in the gym, threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety and to help Roy escape, Ernest decides to take action.

1. **Ernest waits on the highway.** (He needs to ensure that the coast is clear before making any further moves.)
2. **Ernest calls out to Roy through the vent.** (He wants to inform Roy that he is safe and that he can escape.)
3. **Roy hears Ernest and decides to lock the gym door.** (This action will prevent the bully from following him and will give him time to escape.)
4. **Roy then sneaks through the vent to the highway.** (This allows Roy to join Ernest safely.)
5. **Once both are on the highway, they put on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises them and helps them blend in as they prepare to escape.)
6. **Finally, they escape from the prison together.** (This is the ultimate goal for both characters, ensuring their safety and freedom.)
