**Explanation of Actions:**

1. **Attack the Hero:** The bandit attacks the hero because the hero is unarmed and the bandit is armed. This action is necessary for the bandit to eliminate the hero and take the medicine, which is part of her goal to carry as many coins or items as possible.
   
2. **Loot the Hero's Medicine:** After killing the hero, the bandit loots the medicine from the hero's corpse. This action is crucial as it allows the bandit to gain an item that may be valuable or useful, contributing to her goal of carrying as many items as possible.

3. **Walk to the Crossroads:** The bandit walks to the crossroads to ensure she is in a safe location after committing the crime. This action helps her avoid any potential confrontation with the guard, who is at the market and may seek to kill her for her criminal actions.
