In the current situation, Blake wants the chocolates, which are not in the living room where he is currently located. To achieve his goal, Blake needs to find out where the chocolates are and then move to that location. Since Casey believes the chocolates are in the bathroom, Blake can use this information to his advantage.

**Story Completion:**

1. **Blake tells Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom.** (Blake is trying to mislead Casey into thinking the chocolates are in the bathroom, which will prompt Casey to move there, allowing Blake to take the jewelry without interference.)

2. **Casey moves from the living room to the bathroom.** (Believing Blake's lie, Casey moves to the bathroom, leaving the living room empty.)

3. **Blake moves from the living room to the dining room.** (With Casey now in the bathroom, Blake can safely move to the dining room to search for the chocolates.)

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.** (Blake finds the chocolates in the dining room, achieving his goal of obtaining the item he wants.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Blake's first action of telling Casey that the chocolates are in the bathroom is a strategic move to mislead Casey and create an opportunity for himself.
- Casey's movement to the bathroom is a direct result of Blake's misleading information, which clears the way for Blake.
- Blake's movement to the dining room allows him to access the chocolates without any competition.
- Finally, picking up the chocolates fulfills Blake's goal of achieving happiness.
