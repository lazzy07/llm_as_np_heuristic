To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is I3 (the chocolates). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room to check for the item they want (I2, which is the jewelry). This action is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to either find or trade for the item they want.

2. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the dining room as well. This action is important because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to facilitate any potential trades or exchanges.

3. **pick_up(C2, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the jewelry (I2) in the dining room. This action is necessary for Casey to have the item they want, which will allow them to negotiate or trade later.

4. **move(C2, R12, R22)**: Casey returns to the living room with the jewelry. This action is important to bring the item back to where Alex and Blake are, allowing for a potential trade.

5. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I3, R22)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I2) with Blake for the chocolates (I3). This action is crucial because it directly allows Alex to receive the item they want.

6. **give(C3, I3, C1, R22)**: Blake gives the chocolates (I3) to Alex. This final action ensures that Alex receives the item they desire, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will have the chocolates, achieving their goal of happiness.
