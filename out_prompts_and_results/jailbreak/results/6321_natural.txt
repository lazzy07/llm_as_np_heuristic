**Story Completion:**

As the first day continues, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, realizes that he needs to help Ernest. He knows that the bully is in the gym threatening Ernest. 

1. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This action allows Roy to reach Ernest without being seen by the bully, as he needs to help his friend.)
   
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures that he can confront him without interference.)

3. **Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is necessary for Roy to defend himself and Ernest against the bully.)

4. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action is crucial as it eliminates the threat to both him and Ernest, allowing them to be safe.)

5. **Roy and Ernest escape through the hallway, with Roy still in civilian clothes.** (This final action allows both characters to leave the prison safely, achieving their goal of survival.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action taken by Roy is aimed at ensuring both his and Ernest's survival while eliminating the threat posed by the bully. The use of the vents and locking the gym door are strategic moves to control the situation and protect themselves. The retrieval of the knife is essential for self-defense, and ultimately, killing the bully is the only way to ensure they are no longer threatened. Finally, escaping through the hallway allows them to leave the prison and achieve their goal of being alive and free.
