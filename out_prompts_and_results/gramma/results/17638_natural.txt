To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the market.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the guard and potentially rob the merchant of the hero's coin.

2. **The bandit robs the merchant of the hero's coin.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to acquire the coin that the merchant has, which is part of the bandit's goal to carry as many coins as possible.

3. **The bandit walks from the market back to the crossroads.**  
   - This action is necessary for the bandit to return to a safe location where they can store the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

4. **The bandit walks from the crossroads to the bandit camp.**  
   - This action allows the bandit to reach the camp where they can store the coins.

5. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.**  
   - This action fulfills the bandit's goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.

The sequence of actions ensures that the bandit successfully achieves their goal of acquiring and storing coins without being confronted by the guard.
