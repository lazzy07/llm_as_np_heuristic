**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores, Ernest is in the laundry room with the pack of cigarettes he stole from the bully. Meanwhile, Roy is in the hallway, disguised in civilian clothes. 

1. **Action: go(Roy, Hall)** - Roy is already in the hallway, so he remains there, ready to make his next move.
2. **Action: vent(Roy, Highway)** - Roy crawls through the vents to reach the highway, where he can escape the prison.
3. **Action: escape(Roy, Highway)** - Once on the highway, Roy puts on his civilian clothes to disguise himself and successfully escapes from the prison.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Roy's actions are focused on escaping the prison. By crawling through the vents, he avoids the bully and guards, and by disguising himself in civilian clothes, he ensures he can leave without being recognized. 
- Ernest, while threatened by the bully, does not take any action that would lead to his own escape, as his focus is on survival and not being threatened. However, his possession of the cigarettes does not impact Roy's successful escape.
