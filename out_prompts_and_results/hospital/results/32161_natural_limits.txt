Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess the patients in the admissions room. 

1. **Dr. Hathaway walks from Patient Room B to Admissions.** This action is necessary for Hathaway to assess the patients who are currently in the admissions room, Jones and Ross, to determine their symptoms.

2. **Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B.** By admitting Jones to an exam room, Hathaway can then assess and treat him. This increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but he is still able to assess Jones without making a mistake.

3. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room B.** This action allows Hathaway to determine Jones's symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing an unknown condition, Hathaway will have to make a decision based on the information available.

4. **Dr. Hathaway treats Jones for Flaze.** Assuming Jones has Flaze (fever), Hathaway administers antibiotics. If Jones indeed has Flaze, he will become healthy. This action reduces Hathaway's workload back to 2.

After these actions, all patients are healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
