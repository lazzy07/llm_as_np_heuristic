In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Given the current situation, the following action will help Blake achieve their goal:

1. **trade(Blake, I2, Alex, I1, R22)**: Blake can trade the item they have (I2) with Alex for the jewelry (I1). This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Alex's desire for the jewelry, making Alex happy. Since Blake's goal is to make Alex happy, this trade will also make Blake happy as they successfully helped Alex.

After this action, the happiness states will be:
- happy(Alex) = True (because they now have I1)
- happy(Blake) = True (because they achieved their goal of making Alex happy)
- happy(Casey) = False (Casey remains unhappy as they still do not have the item they want)

This single action is sufficient to ensure that Blake achieves their goal of making Alex happy.
