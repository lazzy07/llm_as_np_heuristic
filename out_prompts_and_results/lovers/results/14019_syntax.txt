To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry (I3), we can outline the following actions:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where Alex is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and potentially receive the jewelry.

2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) is in the dining room (R21) and has given away the jewelry (I3).
- Casey (C3) is now in the dining room (R21) and has received the jewelry (I3), making them happy.
- Blake (C2) remains in the living room (R21) and is still unhappy, but the focus is on Casey's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to receive the jewelry.
2. **give(C1, I3, C3, R21)**: Alex gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R22, R21)",
    "give(C1, I3, C3, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
