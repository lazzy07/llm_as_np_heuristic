**Story Completion:**

Roy, knowing that the bully is in the gym and that he has the knife, decides to take action. He quickly crawls through the vents from the hallway to the gym, where he finds the bully alone. With the knife in hand, Roy confronts the bully and, in a moment of desperation and determination, he kills the bully. 

With the threat eliminated, Roy can now safely return to the hallway, where he puts on the civilian clothes he stole earlier. Disguised, he makes his way to the highway outside the prison. There, he successfully escapes, achieving his goal of being alive and free.

**Explanation of Actions:**
1. **Crawl through the vents to the gym**: This action allows Roy to confront the bully without being detected, as the gym door is locked and the bully is unaware of his approach.
2. **Kill the bully with the knife**: This action eliminates the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest, ensuring their safety.
3. **Return to the hallway**: After dealing with the bully, Roy needs to get back to a safe area to prepare for his escape.
4. **Put on the civilian clothes**: This disguises Roy, allowing him to blend in and avoid detection by the guards.
5. **Escape to the highway**: This final action achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free from the prison.
