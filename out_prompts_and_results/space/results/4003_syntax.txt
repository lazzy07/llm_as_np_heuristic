To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy and safe while making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and attempts to establish a friendly relationship. This action is crucial as it directly addresses Zoe's goal of making friends with the Lizard, which is essential for both characters to feel safe and healthy.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary to ensure that both characters are in the same location to continue building their friendship.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave. This action reinforces the idea of cooperation and friendship, as both characters are now together in a safe location away from the dangerous surface.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action serves to highlight the danger of the surface and the importance of their decision to move to the cave.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
