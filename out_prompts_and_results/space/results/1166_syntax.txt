Zoe is currently in the cave, while the Lizard is on the surface. The surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt. Zoe's goal is to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard. The Lizard also wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with Zoe.

To achieve this, Zoe will take the following actions:

1. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: Zoe walks from the cave to the surface to meet the Lizard. This is necessary because she needs to be in the same location as the Lizard to interact and potentially become friends.

2. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Once on the surface, Zoe makes peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it allows them to stop any potential fighting and start building a friendship.

3. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe walks back to the cave. This is a strategic move to ensure that both characters can be safe from the erupting volcano.

4. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, seeing that Zoe has made peace and is moving to safety, follows her into the cave. This action ensures that both characters are now in a safe location together.

5. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both Zoe and the Lizard are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption.

By following these actions, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
