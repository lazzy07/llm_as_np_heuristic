In the current situation, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. Alex wants item I3 (which is currently with Casey), and Casey wants item I2 (which is currently unknown to Blake). 

To achieve Blake's goal of happiness, Blake can take the following action:

1. **Trade**: Blake can trade item I1 (which is in the dining room) with Casey for item I3 (which is currently with Casey). This will make Blake happy because they will have the item they want (I3), and it will also make Alex happy since Alex wants I3.

Here’s the complete action:

- **trade(Blake, I1, Casey, I3, R22)**: Blake trades the chocolates (I1) for the flowers (I3) with Casey in the living room (R22).

This action is necessary because it directly fulfills Blake's desire for happiness by obtaining the item they want (I3). 

After this trade, the situation will be:

- at(C1) = R22; 
- at(C2) = R22; 
- at(C3) = R22; 
- at(I1) = R21; 
- at(I2) = ?; 
- at(I3) = C3; 
- happy(C1) = False; 
- happy(C2) = False; 
- happy(C3) = True; 
- wants(C1) = I3; 
- wants(C2) = I2; 
- wants(C3) = I3; 

Blake is now happy because they have I3, and Alex is also happy because they wanted I3.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
