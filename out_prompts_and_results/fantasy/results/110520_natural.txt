To achieve the goal of making Talia happy or wealthy, we need to focus on the treasure located in the cave, as it is the only item that can contribute to her wealth. Since Vince is at the cave with the money and Gargax is also present, we need to ensure that Talia can access the treasure.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Talia's happiness or wealth:

1. **Vince picks up the treasure**: Vince is at the cave and can pick up the treasure. This action is necessary because it allows Vince to have the treasure, which can later be used to make Talia wealthy.

2. **Gargax eats Vince**: Gargax, who wants to be wealthy and not hungry, will eat Vince. This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Gargax to take the treasure and money without any opposition.

3. **Gargax takes the money from Vince's body**: After eating Vince, Gargax can take the money from Vince's body. This action is necessary because it allows Gargax to become wealthy, which is his goal.

4. **Gargax travels to the village**: Gargax travels to the village where Talia and Rory are. This action is necessary to bring Gargax into the same location as Talia, allowing for the next action.

5. **Gargax gives Talia the treasure**: Gargax gives Talia the treasure. This action is necessary because it directly contributes to Talia's wealth, which is one of her goals.

6. **Talia becomes happy**: With the treasure, Talia's wealth increases, leading to her happiness. This is the final outcome we want to achieve.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. Vince picks up the treasure (to have it available for Talia).
2. Gargax eats Vince (to eliminate opposition and gain access to the treasure).
3. Gargax takes the money from Vince's body (to become wealthy).
4. Gargax travels to the village (to reach Talia).
5. Gargax gives Talia the treasure (to make Talia wealthy).
6. Talia becomes happy (as a result of gaining wealth).
