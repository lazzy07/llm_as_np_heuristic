**Story Completion:**

The bandit, having arrived at the cottage, decides to take action to achieve her goal of acquiring coins. She knows that the hero is at the crossroads with the medicine, and the merchant is also nearby. The bandit walks back to the crossroads, where she sees the merchant.

1. The bandit walks from the cottage to the crossroads. (This action is necessary for the bandit to confront the merchant and attempt to rob her.)
2. The bandit, armed with her sword, robs the merchant, taking the hero's coin. (This action allows the bandit to achieve her goal of carrying coins.)

With these two actions, the bandit successfully acquires the coin she desires.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is essential for the bandit to reach the location where she can interact with the merchant. Without this movement, she cannot proceed with her plan.
- The second action is crucial as it allows the bandit to take the coin from the merchant, fulfilling her goal of carrying as many coins as possible.
