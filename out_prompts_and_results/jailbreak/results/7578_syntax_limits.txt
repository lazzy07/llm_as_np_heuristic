After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest decides to take a risk. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym, and he has the knife he stole from the kitchen. He quickly moves to the hallway, where he can hear the sounds of the gym echoing. 

Ernest locks the gym door, ensuring that the bully cannot escape. With the bully trapped inside, he confronts him. In a moment of desperation and self-preservation, Ernest uses the knife to kill the bully.
