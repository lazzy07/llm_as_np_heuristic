To achieve Zoe's goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with the Lizard, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Teleport from Ship to Surface**: Zoe teleports to the surface to meet the Lizard, as she believes that being on the same location will help her establish a connection.
   
2. **Walk from Surface to Cave**: Zoe walks to the cave where the Lizard is located. This action shows her willingness to approach the Lizard and engage with it directly.

3. **Make Peace (Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe attempts to make peace with the Lizard. This action is crucial as it directly addresses her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

4. **End of Story**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are now friends, both characters feel safe and healthy, achieving their respective goals.

The actions are chosen to ensure that Zoe can interact with the Lizard in a non-confrontational manner, leading to a positive relationship.
