To achieve the goal of having the mastermind dead, the secret agent must first pick up the papers from the dropbox, then move to the courtyard, and finally to the lobby where they can use the papers to enter the office and find the gun. Once the agent has the gun, they can move to the office and kill the mastermind.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:
