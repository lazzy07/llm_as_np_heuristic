Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 3, is at Patient Room A, where Ross is currently located. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is high, there is a risk of making a mistake in diagnosing Ross. To ensure Ross's health, Dr. Hathaway needs to assess him first.

1. **Action: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room A.**
