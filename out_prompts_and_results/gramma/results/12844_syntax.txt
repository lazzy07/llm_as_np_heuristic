To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant moves to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Bandit, Cottage, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves to the Crossroads, which is necessary for the next action where she will interact with the Merchant.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs the Merchant of the coin she is carrying. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to acquire coins without killing the Merchant, thus keeping her criminal status intact.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit then walks to the Bandit Camp to store the coins she has just acquired.

5. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from the Merchant and places them in the chest at the Bandit Camp, achieving her goal of having coins in the chest.

6. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant returns to the Market, where she can continue her business and potentially acquire more coins in the future.

In this sequence, the Merchant does not directly acquire coins but is able to continue her business without becoming a criminal, which aligns with her goal. The Bandit, on the other hand, successfully robs the Merchant and stores the coins, fulfilling her own goal.
