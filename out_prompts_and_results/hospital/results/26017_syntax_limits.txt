To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we can take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Hathaway's workload is currently 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but it is necessary to understand Ross's condition.

2. **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Hathaway assesses Ross and believes he has Flaze (due to the fever symptom), he will treat Ross with antibiotics. This will ensure that Ross becomes healthy.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross in PatientRoomB**: This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to identify Ross's symptoms. Given that Ross is already assigned to PatientRoomB, Hathaway can directly assess him. This is the first step in determining the correct treatment.
  
- **Treat Ross with antibiotics**: If Hathaway correctly identifies Ross's condition as Flaze, treating him with antibiotics will cure him. This action is essential for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

### Final Plan in JSON Format:
```json

This plan ensures that Hathaway can assess and treat Ross effectively, leading to a successful outcome where all patients are healthy.
