To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The following actions will help Bubba achieve this goal:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, who has 1 money. This action is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of having 1 money.

2. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** After stealing the money, Bubba will leave the bank and go back to the house. This action is not directly related to achieving his goal but is necessary for Bubba to have a safe place after the theft.
