Zoe and the Lizard are currently at the cave, having made peace with each other. They both want to be healthy, safe, and to make friends. Since they are already friends, the next logical step is to ensure their safety from the erupting volcano on the surface.

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the spaceship.** This action is taken to ensure Zoe's safety, as the surface is dangerous due to the volcano. By teleporting to the spaceship, she can avoid the eruption.

2. **The volcano erupts on the surface.** This event occurs after Zoe has safely teleported away, ensuring that she is not harmed. The eruption is a necessary plot point to fulfill the story's requirement of the volcano erupting.

3. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** The Lizard, still wanting to protect the planet, goes to the surface to assess the situation. However, this action puts the Lizard in danger.

4. **The volcano finishes erupting.** This event occurs after the Lizard has walked to the surface, resulting in the Lizard's demise. This fulfills the requirement of a character dying.

In summary, the actions taken ensure that Zoe remains safe while the Lizard, despite their friendship, faces the consequences of being on the surface during the eruption. The story ends with the volcano erupting and the Lizard dying, while Zoe is safe and healthy.
