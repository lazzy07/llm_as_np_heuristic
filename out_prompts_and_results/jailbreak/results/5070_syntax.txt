To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Ernest or Roy overcomes the bully's threats by escaping or getting revenge. Given the current situation, the best course of action is for Roy to take the knife from the kitchen and then go to the gym to confront the bully. This will allow him to get revenge on the bully, thus overcoming the threat. 

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **go(Roy, Hall)**: Roy leaves the kitchen and moves to the hallway to access the gym.
   - This action is necessary for Roy to reach the gym where the bully is located.

2. **vent(Roy, Gym)**: Roy crawls through the vents to enter the gym.
   - This action allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully, giving him the element of surprise.

3. **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: Roy kills the bully with the knife in the gym.
   - This action allows Roy to eliminate the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both he and Ernest are no longer threatened.

4. **next_day()**: The day ends, and we transition to day two.
   - This action signifies the end of the first day and the beginning of the next, but since the goal has been achieved, it serves as a narrative closure.

The story ends with Roy overcoming the bully's threat by killing him, ensuring both he and Ernest are safe.

Here’s the explanation of each action:
- **go(Roy, Hall)**: Necessary for Roy to leave the kitchen and approach the gym.
- **vent(Roy, Gym)**: Allows Roy to enter the gym stealthily, avoiding confrontation until he is ready.
- **kill(Bully, Roy, Gym)**: This is the climax of the story where Roy takes decisive action against the bully, ensuring their safety.
- **next_day()**: Marks the transition to the next day, indicating the end of the story.
