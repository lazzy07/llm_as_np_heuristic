To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross**: Since Ross is currently in the admissions room and has not been assigned to an exam room, Hathaway needs to admit Ross to an exam room first. However, since Hathaway's workload is currently 2, they can assess Ross without admitting him first. This will help determine Ross's symptoms.

2. **Admit Ross to Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will admit him to Exam Room C. This will allow Hathaway to treat Ross based on the symptoms identified.

3. **Assess Young**: Similar to Ross, Young is also in the admissions room. Hathaway will assess Young to determine their symptoms.

4. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room B, where they can be treated.

5. **Treat Jones**: Since Jones has already been assessed and has a known symptom (SymptomB), Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment for that symptom.

6. **Treat Ross**: After admitting Ross to Exam Room C and assessing him, Hathaway will treat Ross based on the symptoms identified.

7. **Treat Young**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Young based on the symptoms identified during the assessment.

By following these steps, Hathaway will ensure that all patients are treated correctly, leading to their health and survival.
