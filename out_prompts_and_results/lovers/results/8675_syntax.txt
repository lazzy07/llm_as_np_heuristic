To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: Alex (C1) will trade the chocolates (I3) they have with Casey (C2) for the jewelry (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because Alex wants the jewelry to be happy, and trading is a way to obtain it without needing to move to another room.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1), making Alex happy.
- Casey will have the chocolates (I3), which is not what Casey wants, but it does not affect Alex's goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken and their purpose:

1. **trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)**: This action allows Alex to obtain the jewelry they want by giving away the chocolates they have. This directly leads to Alex's happiness.

Now, here is the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C1, I3, C2, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Alex achieves their goal of happiness by acquiring the jewelry they desire.
