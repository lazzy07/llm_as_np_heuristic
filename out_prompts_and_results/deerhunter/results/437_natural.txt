To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba either ends up with the money or that Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has the money. The most straightforward way for Bubba to achieve his goal is to steal the money from the clerk using the rifle.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to steal.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to get the money from the clerk.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (This action allows Bubba to obtain the money he desires.)
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** (This action allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger.)

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

1. **Bubba decides to steal.** - This action is crucial because it sets Bubba's intention to take the money from the clerk, which is his goal.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - This action directly fulfills Bubba's desire to have money, achieving one of the story's goals.
3. **Bubba decides to eat.** - This action allows Bubba to address his hunger, which is a secondary goal but still important for his well-being.

At this point, Bambi remains alive, but Bubba has successfully obtained the money.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Bubba decides to steal",
    "Bubba steals the money from the clerk",
    "Bubba decides to eat"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Bubba ends up with the money, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
