To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba ends up with the money or that Bambi is confirmed dead. Since Bambi is already dead, we can focus on Bubba's actions to achieve his goal of obtaining money.

Here’s the completed story:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and the clerk has money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Bubba has a loaded rifle, allowing him to steal from the clerk.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba is now leaving the bank with the stolen money.)
4. **Bubba decides to eat.** (Bubba is hungry and can now eat Bambi, who is dead.)

### Explanation of Actions:
1. **Decide to steal the money:** This action is necessary because Bubba's goal is to have money, and the clerk has it.
2. **Steal the money:** This action directly fulfills Bubba's goal of obtaining money.
3. **Go to the house:** This action is necessary for Bubba to leave the bank after stealing the money.
4. **Decide to eat:** This action is included to show that Bubba is fulfilling his hunger, and it confirms that Bambi is dead, which is also a condition of the story.

At the end of these actions, Bubba has the money, and Bambi is confirmed dead.

Here’s the JSON object with the final plan:
