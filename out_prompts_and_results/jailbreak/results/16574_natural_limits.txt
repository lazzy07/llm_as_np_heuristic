**Story Completion:**

As the first day in the prison drags on, Ernest finds himself in the gym, facing the bully who is furious about the stolen cigarettes. The bully, towering over him, threatens Ernest, making it clear that he won't let this slide. Ernest knows he needs to act quickly to protect himself and his friend Roy.

Meanwhile, in the cells, Roy is aware of the danger they are both in. He decides to take a risk. He sneaks through the vents from the cells to the gym, hoping to help Ernest. Once in the gym, he sees the bully threatening Ernest and realizes he needs to distract the bully to give Ernest a chance to escape.

Roy grabs a nearby weight and throws it across the gym, creating a loud noise. The bully turns to investigate, giving Ernest the opportunity to slip out of the gym and into the hallway. With the bully distracted, Ernest makes a break for it, heading towards the laundry room where he knows the civilian clothes are stored.

In the laundry room, Ernest quickly puts on the civilian clothes, disguising himself. He then makes his way to the highway, where he successfully escapes the prison, leaving the threats of the bully behind.
