To achieve the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead (or both), we can outline the following actions:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba, who is greedy and wants money, will shoot the bank clerk to steal the money. This action is necessary because Bubba's greed drives him to eliminate the clerk, who is the only obstacle to obtaining the money.

2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk and taking the money, Bubba can go to the forest and eat Bambi. This action is included to ensure that Bambi is dead, fulfilling the second part of the goal.

Here’s the complete story with explanations for each action:

1. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba uses the rifle he picked up earlier to shoot the bank clerk. This action is motivated by his greed for money, and since he has a loaded gun, he can successfully kill the clerk and take the money.

2. **go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)**: After shooting the clerk, Bubba goes to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to reach Bambi and fulfill his goal of eating her.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: Finally, Bubba eats Bambi, ensuring that she is dead. This action is included to meet the requirement of Bambi being dead.

By executing these actions, Bubba ends up with the money from the bank clerk and Bambi is also dead.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)",
    "go(Bubba, Bank, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan effectively achieves the goal of either Bubba having the money or Bambi being dead, or both.
