Tom, having successfully looted the medicine from the merchant, realizes he needs to get back to the cottage to use it. He knows the bandit is at the market and armed, but he also knows the guard is there. 

To achieve his goal of getting to the cottage with the medicine, Tom decides to report the bandit’s location to the guard. This action is strategic because it not only alerts the guard to the bandit’s presence, potentially leading to the bandit being dealt with, but it also allows Tom to safely make his way back to the cottage without the threat of the bandit.

After reporting the bandit’s location, Tom walks from the crossroads to the cottage, successfully carrying the medicine back to where he wants to be.
