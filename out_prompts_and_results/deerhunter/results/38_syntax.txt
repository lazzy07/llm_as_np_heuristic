To complete the story, Bubba's goal is to satisfy his hunger. Since he is currently hungry and has a loaded rifle, he can go to the forest to hunt Bambi, who is alive and a potential source of food. 

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Forest)**: Bubba decides to leave the house and go to the forest where Bambi is located. This action is necessary for Bubba to find food.

2. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Once in the forest, Bubba uses his loaded rifle to shoot Bambi. This action is necessary for Bubba to obtain food, as Bambi is a deer and can be eaten.

3. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action satisfies Bubba's hunger.

Now, let's explain why each action is included:

- **Going to the forest** is essential because Bubba needs to be in the same location as Bambi to hunt her.
- **Shooting Bambi** is necessary to obtain food, as Bubba is hungry and needs to eat.
- **Eating Bambi** fulfills Bubba's hunger, which is his primary goal.
