**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy finishes his chores in the kitchen and realizes he needs to help Ernest. He knows the bully is in the gym and is threatening both of them. 

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to access the gym where the bully is.)
2. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from escaping and gives Roy a chance to confront him without the threat of being attacked.)
3. **Roy sneaks through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to enter the gym without being seen by the bully.)
4. **Roy grabs the knife from the kitchen.** (This action is crucial for Roy to defend himself and potentially kill the bully.)
5. **Roy confronts the bully and kills him with the knife.** (This action eliminates the threat posed by the bully, ensuring both Roy and Ernest are safe.)

With the bully dead, Roy can now return to the laundry room to meet up with Ernest. They can then plan their escape together.
