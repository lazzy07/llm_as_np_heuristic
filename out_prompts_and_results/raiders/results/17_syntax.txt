To ensure the Nazis achieve their goal of immortality, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **open(Nazis, Ark, Tanis)**: The Nazis will open the Ark of the Covenant in Tanis. Since the Ark is not dangerous (as indicated by the current situation), this action will grant them immortality.

This is the only action needed to achieve the Nazis' goal, as they already possess the Ark and are in the correct location to open it.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **open(Nazis, Ark, Tanis)**: This action is crucial because it directly leads to the Nazis achieving their goal of immortality. Since the Ark is confirmed to be safe, opening it will not result in their deaths, but rather grant them the immortality they seek.
