To ensure Gargax achieves their goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax obtaining the treasure while also ensuring that Talia and Rory do not interfere with this goal. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **eat(Gargax, Rory, Cave)**: Gargax eats Rory. This action eliminates a potential competitor for the treasure and ensures that Rory cannot interfere with Gargax's plans. Since Gargax does not care about happiness, this action is purely strategic for wealth acquisition.

2. **take(Gargax, Money, Vince, Cave)**: Gargax takes the money from Vince's dead body. Since Vince is dead, Gargax can take the money without any repercussions. This action increases Gargax's wealth.
