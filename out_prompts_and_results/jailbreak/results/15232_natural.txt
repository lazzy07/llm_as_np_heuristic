**Story Completion:**

As the first day progresses, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes on the highway, realizes he has a chance to escape. He knows that Ernest is still in the cells and is threatened by the bully. To ensure both of their safety, Roy decides to take action.

1. **Roy moves to the hallway.** (This action is necessary for Roy to get back into the prison to help Ernest.)
2. **Roy crawls through the vents to the gym.** (This allows Roy to access the gym without being seen by the bully.)
3. **Roy locks the gym door.** (By locking the door, Roy prevents the bully from escaping and ensures he can confront him safely.)
4. **Roy retrieves the knife from the kitchen.** (This is essential for Roy to defend himself and potentially eliminate the threat posed by the bully.)
5. **Roy kills the bully with the knife.** (This action removes the immediate threat to both Roy and Ernest, allowing Roy to focus on the escape.)
6. **Roy returns to the hallway.** (This is necessary for Roy to get back to the highway where he can escape.)
7. **Roy escapes from the prison using the civilian clothes disguise.** (This final action achieves Roy's goal of being alive and free.)

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Each action is designed to ensure Roy can eliminate the threat of the bully while also ensuring his own safety and that of Ernest. The locking of the gym door is crucial to prevent the bully from retaliating. The retrieval of the knife is necessary for self-defense and to confront the bully. Finally, escaping in civilian clothes is the ultimate goal, allowing Roy to leave the prison safely.
