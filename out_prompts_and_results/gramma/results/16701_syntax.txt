To ensure Tom achieves his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, we need to create a sequence of actions that allows him to safely navigate the situation with the bandit and the guard. Hereâ€™s the shortest story that accomplishes this:

1. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Market.** (Tom needs to be at the Market to interact with the Merchant.)
2. **Tom buys a coin from the Merchant using the medicine.** (Tom needs a coin to pay for the sword.)
3. **Tom walks from Market to Crossroads.** (Tom needs to return to the Crossroads to access the path to the cottage.)
4. **Tom walks from Crossroads to Cottage.** (Tom finally reaches his goal of being at the cottage.)

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Walking to Market:** Tom needs to be at the Market to buy a sword, which is essential for his safety against the bandit.
- **Buying a Coin:** Tom uses the medicine he has to buy a coin from the Merchant. This is necessary because he needs a coin to buy a sword for protection.
- **Walking back to Crossroads:** After acquiring the coin, Tom returns to the Crossroads to access the path to the cottage.
- **Walking to Cottage:** Finally, Tom walks to the cottage, achieving his goal of being there with the medicine.

### JSON Object with Final Plan:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)",
    "buy(Tom, TomCoin, Medicine, Market)",
    "walk(Tom, Market, Crossroads)",
    "walk(Tom, Crossroads, Cottage)"
  ]
}
``` 

This sequence of actions ensures that Tom successfully reaches the cottage while carrying the medicine, fulfilling his goal.
