**Story Completion:**

As the day progresses, Roy realizes that the bully is a significant threat to both him and Ernest. He knows he needs to act quickly to ensure their survival. 

1. **Roy locks the gym door.** (This action prevents the bully from entering the gym and gives Roy a moment to strategize without immediate threat.)
   
2. **Roy puts on the civilian clothes.** (This disguises him, allowing him to move more freely without being recognized as a prisoner.)

3. **Roy crawls through the vents to the highway.** (This action allows him to escape the immediate danger of the bully and the prison environment.)

4. **Roy escapes from the prison.** (With the disguise on the highway, he successfully leaves the prison, achieving his goal of survival.)

- Crawling through the vents to the highway is a strategic move to avoid the bully and guards, allowing him to reach the outside world.
