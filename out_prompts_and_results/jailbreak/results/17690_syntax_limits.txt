**Story Completion:**

After completing his chores in the kitchen, Ernest, who is disguised in civilian clothes, decides to make his move. He knows that the bully is currently in the gym and that he needs to escape the prison. Since he has the knife, he can ensure his safety if he encounters the bully. 

Ernest quickly heads to the hallway, where he can access the gym. He locks the gym door behind him, trapping the bully inside. With the bully unable to threaten him, Ernest feels a sense of relief. He then crawls through the vents to reach the highway, where he can finally escape the prison.
