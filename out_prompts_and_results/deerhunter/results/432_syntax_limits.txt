Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs money. He loads his rifle with ammunition and heads to the bank, where the bank clerk is working. Bubba, with his rifle loaded, enters the bank and threatens the clerk, demanding the money. The clerk, fearing for his life, hands over the money to Bubba. With the money in hand, Bubba leaves the bank, satisfied with his haul.

Here’s the sequence of actions and their explanations:

1. **go(Bubba, House, Bank)**: Bubba leaves the house to go to the bank, where he believes he can get money.
2. **shoot(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Bubba threatens the clerk with his loaded rifle, which allows him to take the money without resistance.
3. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action is implicit in the previous action, as Bubba takes the money from the clerk under threat.
4. **go(Bubba, Bank, House)**: After obtaining the money, Bubba returns to the house, satisfied with his actions.

This story ends with Bubba having the money, achieving his goal.
