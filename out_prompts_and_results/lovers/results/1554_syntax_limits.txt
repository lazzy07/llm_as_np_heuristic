In this story, Alex wants to be happy by obtaining the flowers (I1), while Casey wants to be happy by obtaining the jewelry (I3). Blake, who is in the same room as Casey, wants to be happy by obtaining the chocolates (I2). 

Given the current situation, the following action will help Alex achieve their goal:

1. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I2) they have with Casey (C3) for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the flowers they want, thus making them happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex (C1) will be happy because they now have the flowers (I1).
- Casey (C3) will be happy because they now have the chocolates (I2).
- Blake (C2) will be happy because they now have the jewelry (I3).

Thus, Alex achieves their goal of happiness.
