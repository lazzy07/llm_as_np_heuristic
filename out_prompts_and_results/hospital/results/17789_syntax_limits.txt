**Story Completion:**

Hathaway, currently in PatientRoomC, assesses Young, who is showing symptoms of a fever. Given that Young is the only patient in the room, Hathaway correctly identifies the symptom as Flaze. Hathaway then treats Young with antibiotics, which is the appropriate treatment for Flaze. Young becomes healthy as a result.

Next, Hathaway walks back to the Admissions room to assess the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are still waiting. 

**Action Explanations:**

1. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom(Young), PatientRoomC)**: This action is necessary for Hathaway to determine Young's symptoms. Since Young is in the room, Hathaway can assess and identify the disease correctly.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Young, antibiotics, PatientRoomC)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway treats him with the correct medication for Flaze. This action is crucial for achieving Hathaway's goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.

3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomC, Admissions)**: After treating Young, Hathaway needs to check on the other patients, Jones and Ross, who are still in the Admissions room. This action allows Hathaway to continue working towards the goal of patient health.
