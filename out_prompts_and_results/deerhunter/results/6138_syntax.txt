To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of obtaining money. Given the current situation, Bubba is in the forest with a rifle and has just shot Bambi, who is now dead. Bubba is also hungry and has decided to get money. The bank clerk is at the bank, and Bubba believes the clerk is alive and has money.

Here’s the sequence of actions Bubba will take to achieve his goal:

1. **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: Bubba will go to the bank to confront the bank clerk and obtain the money.
2. **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: Once at the bank, Bubba will use his loaded rifle to threaten the bank clerk and steal the money from him.

This sequence of actions is necessary for Bubba to achieve his goal of obtaining money. The first action allows him to reach the location where the money is, and the second action enables him to take the money from the clerk using the threat of his rifle.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)",
    "steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)"
  ]
}
```

- **go(Bubba, Forest, Bank)**: This action is essential as it moves Bubba from the forest, where he is currently located, to the bank, where the money is held.
- **steal(Bubba, Clerk, Rifle, Bank)**: This action allows Bubba to take the money from the bank clerk by using the rifle as leverage, fulfilling his goal of obtaining money.
