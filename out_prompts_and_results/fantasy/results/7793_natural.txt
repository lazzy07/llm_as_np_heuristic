1. **Gargax eats Talia.**  
   - This action is taken because Gargax wants to be wealthy and not hungry. By eating Talia, Gargax can gain her wealth, which is necessary for Talia to achieve her goal of being wealthy, as she will no longer have any wealth to claim.

2. **Gargax takes the money from Talia's body.**  
   - Gargax takes the money from Talia after eating her. This action fulfills Gargax's desire for wealth, and since Talia is no longer alive, it does not affect her happiness.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave.**

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave.**  
   - Gargax picks up the treasure, completing his goal of becoming wealthy.
