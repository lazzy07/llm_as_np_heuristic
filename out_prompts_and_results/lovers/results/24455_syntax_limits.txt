In the current situation, Casey (C3) is in the living room (R21) with Blake (C2), who has the item Casey wants (I3 - jewelry). To achieve their goal of happiness, Casey needs to obtain the jewelry from Blake. 

The simplest action for Casey to take is to trade with Blake, as they are both in the same room and can exchange items. Since Casey is not holding any item, they can propose a trade for the jewelry.

Hereâ€™s the action that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **trade(C3, I1, C2, I3, R21)**: Casey proposes to trade the flowers (I1) they have for the jewelry (I3) that Blake has. This action is necessary because it allows Casey to obtain the item they want, thus achieving their goal of happiness.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Casey will have the jewelry (I3), making them happy.
- Blake will have the flowers (I1), which they may or may not want, but their happiness is not the focus here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry.
