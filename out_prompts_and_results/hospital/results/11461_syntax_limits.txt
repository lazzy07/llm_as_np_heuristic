**Story Completion:**

1. **Assess Hathaway, Young, symptom: ?, room: Admissions**  
   - Hathaway assesses Young to determine their symptoms. This is necessary to identify if Young has Flaze or Jarkis, which will guide the treatment.

2. **Assess Hathaway, Ross, symptom: ?, room: Admissions**  
   - Hathaway assesses Ross next, following the same reasoning as with Young. This ensures that both patients in the admissions room are evaluated.

3. **Admit Hathaway, Young, room: ExamRoomB**  
   - After assessing Young, Hathaway admits them to Exam Room B for treatment. This action is necessary to provide Young with the appropriate care.

4. **Admit Hathaway, Ross, room: ExamRoomA**  
   - Hathaway admits Ross to Exam Room A for treatment as well. This ensures that both patients are being taken care of.

5. **Treat Hathaway, Young, treatment: antibiotics, room: ExamRoomB**  
   - Finally, Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, assuming Young has Flaze based on the assessment. This is the correct treatment to ensure Young becomes healthy.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first two actions (assessing Young and Ross) are crucial for Hathaway to determine the symptoms of both patients, which is necessary for proper treatment.
- The next two actions (admitting Young and Ross to their respective exam rooms) are essential for organizing the patients for treatment.
- The final action (treating Young with antibiotics) is the culmination of the previous assessments and admissions, ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making the patients healthy.
