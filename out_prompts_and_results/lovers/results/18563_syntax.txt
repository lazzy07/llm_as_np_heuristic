To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is I1 (the flowers). The following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **move(C3, R11, R12)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R12) where Alex is currently located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Alex and help them achieve happiness.

2. **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex in the dining room (R12). This action directly fulfills Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **move(C2, R12, R11)**: Blake moves to the dining room (R12) to check on Alex and Casey. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps maintain the social dynamic and allows Blake to see that Alex is now happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have received the flowers they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C3, R11, R12)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Alex to give them the flowers.
- **give(C3, I1, C1, R12)**: This is the crucial action that makes Alex happy by providing them with the item they desire.
- **move(C2, R12, R11)**: While this action does not directly affect Alex's happiness, it keeps the story cohesive by showing Blake's involvement.
