To achieve Talia's goal of being happy and wealthy, the following actions will be taken:

1. **Talia accepts Rory's proposal**: This action is necessary because Talia needs to be happy, and accepting Rory's proposal will make both of them happy. Since Talia has already proposed to Rory, this step is essential for their happiness.

2. **Talia picks up the treasure**: The treasure is located in the cave, and Talia needs to pick it up to become wealthy. This action directly contributes to her goal of wealth.

3. **Talia travels from the cave to the village**: Talia needs to go to the village to be in the same location as Gargax, who has the money. This action is necessary for her to achieve her goal of wealth.

4. **Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body**: Since Vince is dead and has the money, Talia can take it. This action will increase her wealth, fulfilling her goal.

Now, let's summarize the actions in the story:

1. Talia accepts Rory's proposal (Talia's happiness increases).
2. Talia picks up the treasure (Talia's wealth increases).
3. Talia travels from the cave to the village (Talia moves to Gargax's location).
4. Talia takes the money from Vince's dead body (Talia's wealth increases).

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (from marrying Rory) and wealthy (from acquiring the treasure and money).
