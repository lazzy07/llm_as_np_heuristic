Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, is in the forest with a rifle and ammunition. He spots Bambi, the deer, and decides to take advantage of the situation. 

1. **shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)**: Bubba shoots Bambi with the rifle. This action is necessary for Bubba to satisfy his hunger by obtaining food.
2. **eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)**: After shooting Bambi, Bubba eats the deer. This action fulfills his hunger and allows him to survive.

With these two actions, Bubba achieves his goal of satisfying his hunger by eating Bambi.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "shoot(Bubba, Bambi, Rifle, Forest)",
    "eat(Bubba, Bambi, Forest)"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential: the first allows Bubba to kill Bambi, and the second allows him to eat, thus achieving his goal of satisfying his hunger.
