To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure they obtain the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room (R21) where the jewelry (I2) is located. This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to interact with Blake and Alex.

2. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Blake also moves to the dining room (R21). This allows Blake to be in the same room as Casey, facilitating a potential trade or interaction.

3. **trade(C2, I2, C3, I1, R21)**: Blake trades the jewelry (I2) they have for the flowers (I1) that Casey has. This is crucial because it allows Casey to give Blake the item they want, which is the flowers.

4. **move(C3, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the living room (R22) with the jewelry (I2) after the trade.

5. **give(C3, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex (C1). This is the final action that ensures Alex has the item they want, making them happy.

After these actions, Alex will be happy because they have the flowers, which is what they wanted.

### Explanation of Actions:
