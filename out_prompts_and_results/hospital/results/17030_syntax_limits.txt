**Story Completion:**

After admitting Young and Jones to their respective exam rooms, Hathaway walks into Exam Room B to assess Jones. 

1. **assess(Hathaway, Jones, symptom, PatientRoomB)**: Hathaway assesses Jones to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is in the admissions room, he has not yet been treated, and Hathaway needs to identify his condition to provide the correct treatment.

2. **treat(Hathaway, Jones, treatment, PatientRoomB)**: After assessing Jones, Hathaway realizes that he has a fever, indicating that he has Flaze. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. This action ensures that Jones becomes healthy.

3. **walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomB, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway then walks to Exam Room A to assess Young, who is already assigned there.

4. **assess(Hathaway, Young, symptom, PatientRoomA)**: Hathaway assesses Young to determine his symptoms. Young has not been treated yet, and Hathaway needs to identify his condition.

5. **treat(Hathaway, Young, treatment, PatientRoomA)**: After assessing Young, Hathaway finds that he has a fever as well, indicating Flaze. Hathaway treats Young with antibiotics, ensuring that he also becomes healthy.

At this point, both Jones and Young are healthy, and Hathaway has successfully treated them without making any mistakes, as his workload was below three.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- The first action is necessary to identify Jones's symptoms so that Hathaway can provide the correct treatment.
- The second action is crucial as it treats Jones correctly, ensuring he becomes healthy.
- The third action allows Hathaway to move to Young's location to continue his work.
- The fourth action is needed to assess Young's condition, similar to what was done for Jones.
- The fifth action treats Young correctly, ensuring he also becomes healthy.
