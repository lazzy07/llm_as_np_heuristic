### Story Completion

After assessing Young in Exam Room A, Hathaway realizes that Young is showing symptoms of Jarkis (the rash). However, Hathaway's workload is at 3, which means there is a risk of making a mistake. To ensure that Young receives the correct treatment, Hathaway decides to treat Young immediately with steroids, the correct treatment for Jarkis.

Next, Hathaway walks to the admissions room to assess Jones, who is still waiting. Since Hathaway believes Jones is alive and healthy, they will assess Jones to determine if he has any symptoms.
