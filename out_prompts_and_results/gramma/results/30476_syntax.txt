To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk to the Market to be in her preferred location where she can sell items and interact with customers.

2. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Market)**: The Bandit will also walk to the Market, where she can potentially confront the Merchant or interact with Tom.

3. **report(Merchant, Bandit, Market)**: The Merchant will report the Bandit’s location to the Guard, which will help her avoid any criminal activity and keep her status as a non-criminal.

4. **walk(Guard, Market, Crossroads)**: The Guard will walk to the Crossroads after receiving the report from the Merchant, allowing him to confront the Bandit.

5. **attack(Guard, Bandit, Crossroads)**: The Guard will attack the Bandit, as she is a criminal. This action will eliminate the Bandit from the story.

6. **loot(Merchant, BanditCoin, Bandit, Crossroads)**: After the Bandit is defeated, the Merchant will loot the Bandit’s coins, increasing her wealth without committing a crime.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring coins while maintaining her non-criminal status. The Bandit is eliminated, and the Merchant benefits from the loot.
