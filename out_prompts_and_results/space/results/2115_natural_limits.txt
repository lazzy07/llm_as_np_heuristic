Zoe, realizing that the surface is uninhabitable and that the Lizard is at the cave, decides to teleport to the surface again to confront the Lizard. She believes that the Lizard is not the guardian of the surface and wants to make peace. However, as she teleports to the surface, the volcano erupts again, catching her off guard. The eruption is powerful, and Zoe is unable to escape in time, leading to her demise.

This action sequence is necessary to achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and a character dies. Zoe's decision to teleport to the surface, despite the danger, ultimately leads to her death, fulfilling the requirement of the story.
