To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will take place:

1. **The bandit attacks the hero.** This action is necessary because the bandit needs to eliminate the hero, who is a criminal and armed, to take the hero's sword and any items the hero may have. The bandit is armed and can attack the hero since the hero is not carrying a sword.

2. **The bandit loots the hero's corpse.** After successfully attacking the hero, the bandit can loot the hero's corpse to take the merchant's sword and any coins the hero may have. This action is crucial for the bandit to increase her coin count.

3. **The bandit walks from the market to the bandit camp.** This action allows the bandit to return to her camp, where she can store the coins and the sword she has taken from the hero.

4. **The bandit places the coins in the chest at the bandit camp.** This final action ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the bandit camp.
