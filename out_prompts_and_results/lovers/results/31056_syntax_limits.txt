In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I3 (the flowers) to be happy, and they believe that Casey (C2) has it. However, Casey wants item I2 (the chocolates) to be happy, and Blake (C3) wants item I3 (the flowers) to be happy as well. 

To achieve Alex's goal of happiness, the following action can be taken:

1. **trade(C1, I1, C2, I3, R12)**: Alex can trade the jewelry (I1) they have for the flowers (I3) that Casey has. This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they want (I3) directly from Casey, thus making Alex happy.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the flowers (I3) and will be happy.
- Casey will have the jewelry (I1) and will not be happy, but Alex's happiness is the priority here.

### Explanation of the Action:
- The trade action is the only necessary action to ensure that Alex achieves their goal of happiness. By trading the jewelry for the flowers, Alex gets what they want, fulfilling their desire for happiness.
