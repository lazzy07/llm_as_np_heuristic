To complete the story, we need to ensure that the volcano erupts, resulting in a character dying, while also allowing Zoe and the Lizard to become friends. The following sequence of actions will achieve this:

1. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard walks back to the surface from the cave. This action is necessary to bring the Lizard back to the surface where the volcano is located, setting the stage for the eruption.

2. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts. This action is crucial as it fulfills the requirement for the volcano to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both characters.

3. **kill(Lizard, Lizard, Surface)**: The Lizard dies due to the eruption. This action ensures that one character dies as a result of the eruption.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Despite the Lizard's death, Zoe reflects on their brief friendship and the Lizard's role as a guardian. This action symbolizes the friendship that was formed, even if it is posthumous.

The actions are structured to ensure that the volcano erupts, leading to the Lizard's death, while also allowing for the friendship to be recognized, fulfilling the story's requirements.
