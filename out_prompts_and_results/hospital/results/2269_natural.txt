**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Unfortunately, this is incorrect since Jones is experiencing Unknown, but the story requires Hathaway to take action to help the patient.

After treating Jones, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Ross to Patient Room C. This action is necessary to ensure that all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Dr. Hathaway then assesses Ross in Patient Room C. Since Ross is also experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify his disease either. However, Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, mistakenly believing he might have Jarkis.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to admit Young to Patient Room B. This ensures that all patients are assigned to an exam room, and Hathaway can continue to work towards their goal of ensuring all patients are healthy.
