Bubba is in the forest, hungry and wanting money. To achieve his goal of having money, he decides to take action against the bank clerk who has the money he desires. 

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** (Bubba is hungry and wants to eat, but he also wants money. Shooting Bambi will allow him to eat, but it also serves as a distraction to the clerk.)
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** (This action is necessary to fulfill Bubba's hunger and to create a situation where he can approach the clerk without immediate suspicion.)
3. **Bubba eats Bambi.** (Bubba is hungry, and eating Bambi will satisfy his hunger.)
4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** (After eating, Bubba needs to go to the bank to confront the clerk.)
5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, achieving his goal of having money.)

This sequence of actions allows Bubba to satisfy his hunger and achieve his goal of obtaining money.
