To complete the story, Zoe needs to ensure her safety and health while also making friends with the Lizard. Since they are already on friendly terms, the next step is to ensure they both remain safe from the dangerous conditions on the surface, particularly the threat of the volcano erupting.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that Zoe will take:

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe will walk to the cave where the Lizard is located, seeking shelter from the eruption.
3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard will also walk to the cave, as it is the safest place during the eruption.
4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once both characters are in the cave, Zoe will solidify their friendship with the Lizard, ensuring they are both safe and healthy together.
