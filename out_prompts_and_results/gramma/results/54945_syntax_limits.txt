After the events that have transpired, Tom is in the Market, having just attacked the Merchant. He now has the Merchant's sword and is aware that the Medicine is still in the Merchant's possession. However, the Merchant is dead, and the Medicine is now on the ground in the Market.

To achieve his goal of being at the cottage carrying the medicine, Tom needs to take the following action:

1. **Take(Tom, Medicine, Merchant, Market)**: Tom picks up the Medicine from the Merchant's corpse. This action is necessary because Tom's goal is to carry the Medicine to the cottage.
