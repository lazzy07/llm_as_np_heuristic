The merchant, realizing the danger posed by the bandit, decides to take action to protect herself and her goods. She knows that the guard is at the market and can help her. 

1. The merchant walks from the camp to the market. This action is necessary for the merchant to be in the same location as the guard, where she can seek assistance and ensure her safety.
   
2. Upon arriving at the market, the merchant reports the location of the bandit to the guard. This action is crucial as it allows the guard to take action against the bandit, thereby protecting the merchant and allowing her to continue her business without fear of becoming a criminal.

With the bandit dealt with, the merchant can now safely continue her trade and accumulate coins without resorting to criminal activity.
