**Story Completion:**

In the bathroom, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy. Alex holds the jewelry but wants the flowers. Blake wants the chocolates, which are in the dining room. Casey, however, wants the jewelry that Alex has.

To achieve their goal, Casey decides to take action. 

1. **Casey tells Alex that they want the flowers.** This is a strategic move because it misleads Alex into thinking that Casey is not interested in the jewelry, which could prompt Alex to consider giving away the jewelry.

2. **Casey picks up the flowers from the bathroom.** Since the flowers are in the bathroom, Casey can easily pick them up. This action allows Casey to obtain the item they want.

Now, Casey is happy because they have the flowers, which is their goal.

**Explanation of Actions:**
- Casey's first action of telling Alex they want the flowers is a lie that serves to distract Alex from the fact that Casey actually wants the jewelry. This is a necessary action to create a situation where Alex might be willing to give up the jewelry.
- The second action of picking up the flowers is crucial because it directly leads to Casey achieving their goal of happiness by obtaining the item they desire.
