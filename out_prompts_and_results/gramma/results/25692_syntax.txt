To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Merchant, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Merchant will walk from the Camp to the Crossroads to be in a location where she can interact with Tom and potentially sell him items.

2. **walk(Tom, Crossroads, Market)**: Tom will walk from the Crossroads to the Market, where he believes he can find the Merchant and buy more items.

3. **walk(Merchant, Crossroads, Market)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Market to be in the same location as Tom, allowing her to sell items to him.

4. **buy(Tom, Medicine, TomCoin, Market)**: Tom will buy the Medicine from the Merchant using the coin he has. This action allows the Merchant to gain a coin while Tom gets the Medicine he desires.

5. **walk(Merchant, Market, Camp)**: The Merchant will walk back to the Camp, where she can store her coins safely and avoid any potential conflict.
