Bubba, feeling hungry and desperate for money, decides to take action. He looks at the bank clerk, who has the money he desires. With the rifle loaded, Bubba points it at the clerk and demands the money. The clerk, realizing the danger, hesitates but ultimately hands over the money to Bubba. Satisfied, Bubba leaves the bank with the money he wanted.

1. **Bubba shoots the clerk**: This action is not taken because Bubba's goal is to obtain the money, and shooting the clerk would not be necessary if the clerk willingly gives him the money.
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk**: This action is taken after the clerk hands over the money, fulfilling Bubba's goal without unnecessary violence.
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house**: This action is taken to conclude the story, as Bubba now has the money and can return home.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, achieving his goal.
