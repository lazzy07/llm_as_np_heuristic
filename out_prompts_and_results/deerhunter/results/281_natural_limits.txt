Bubba, feeling hungry and greedy, decides he needs to get the money from the bank clerk. He approaches the clerk and, with the rifle in hand, he loads the ammunition. 

1. **Bubba loads ammunition into the rifle.** (This action is necessary for Bubba to threaten the clerk and achieve his goal of getting the money.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (With the rifle loaded, Bubba can now steal the money from the clerk, fulfilling his desire for money.)

At this point, Bubba has successfully obtained the money he wanted, and Bambi remains alive in the forest, as she was not involved in this confrontation.

The story ends with Bubba having the money, achieving one of the specified endings.
