In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all present. Alex wants the flowers, which are currently with Casey. To achieve their goal, Alex can simply ask Casey for the flowers.

**Action:**
- Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers.

**Explanation:**
This action is necessary because it directly communicates Alex's desire to Casey, who currently has the flowers. Since Casey wants Alex to be happy, they will likely give the flowers to Alex, fulfilling Alex's goal.

After this action, the situation will be:
- Alex is happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is still not happy because they still want the chocolates.
- Casey is happy because they helped Alex.

Hereâ€™s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["Alex tells Casey that they want the flowers."]
}
