To achieve the Bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following actions will be taken:

1. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit will rob Tom, who is currently dead and has a coin. This action is necessary for the Bandit to acquire coins, as Tom is the only character with coins available at this moment.

2. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: After robbing Tom, the Bandit will take the coins from Tom and then walk to the Bandit Camp to store the coins in the chest. This action ensures that the Bandit achieves her goal of having coins in the chest at the camp.

The story is short and direct, focusing solely on the Bandit's actions to achieve her goal without unnecessary interactions with other characters.

### Explanation of Actions:
