To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R12) to retrieve the item they want, which is the jewelry (I3). This is necessary because Casey needs to be in a position to trade or give items.

2. **pick_up(C3, I2, R12)**: Casey picks up the chocolates (I2) from the bathroom. This is essential as Casey needs to have the item to either give it to Blake or trade it.

3. **move(C3, R12, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) where Blake is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake.

4. **give(C3, I2, C2, R22)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.
