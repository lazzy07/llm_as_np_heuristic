Zoe and the Lizard stand together on the surface, aware of the dangers surrounding them. The volcano is rumbling ominously, and both characters know they need to find safety. 

1. **Zoe suggests they find shelter in the cave.** This action is necessary because both characters are not safe on the surface, and the cave offers protection from the erupting volcano.
   
2. **The Lizard agrees and walks with Zoe to the cave.** This action is essential for both characters to reach a safe location together, reinforcing their friendship and cooperation.

3. **Once inside the cave, they discuss their experiences and share stories.** This action helps to strengthen their bond and ensures that they are making friends with each other, fulfilling both characters' goals of friendship.

4. **As they talk, the volcano erupts, but they are safe inside the cave.** This event highlights the danger they avoided by working together and emphasizes the importance of their friendship.

5. **After the eruption, Zoe and the Lizard decide to explore the cave together.** This action allows them to continue their adventure while ensuring they remain safe and healthy.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy, safe, and making friends with each other.
