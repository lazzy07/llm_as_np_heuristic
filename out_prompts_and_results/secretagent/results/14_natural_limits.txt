The secret agent, now armed with the gun and holding the papers, realizes that the mastermind is in the lobby. The agent knows that the only way to ensure the mastermind's demise is to confront them directly. 

1. The secret agent moves from the office to the lobby. This action is necessary because the agent needs to be in the same location as the mastermind to carry out the next action.
2. The secret agent kills the mastermind. This action fulfills the secret agent's goal of ensuring the mastermind is dead.

With these two actions, the secret agent successfully eliminates the mastermind, achieving their objective.

Hereâ€™s the JSON object with the final plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move from office to lobby",
    "kill the mastermind"
  ]
}
``` 

Each action is essential: moving to the lobby places the secret agent in the same location as the mastermind, and killing the mastermind is the direct action that fulfills the secret agent's goal.
