To ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness, we need to make sure they obtain the jewelry (I3) that they want. Given the current situation, we can see that Casey is in the living room (R11), while Blake is in the dining room (R21) with the chocolates (I2), and Alex is in the dining room (R22) with the flowers (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Casey's happiness:

1. **move(C3, R11, R21)**: Casey moves from the living room to the dining room where Blake is located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and potentially obtain the item they want.

2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry (I3) to Casey. This action is crucial as it directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making them happy.

After these actions, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex is still in the dining room with the flowers (I1).
- Blake is in the dining room having given away the jewelry (I3).
- Casey is now in the dining room with the jewelry (I3) and is happy.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **move(C3, R11, R21)**: Casey needs to be in the same room as Blake to receive the jewelry.
2. **give(C2, I3, C3, R21)**: Blake gives the jewelry to Casey, fulfilling Casey's desire and making them happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "move(C3, R11, R21)",
    "give(C2, I3, C3, R21)"
  ]
}
``` 

This plan ensures that Casey achieves their goal of happiness by obtaining the jewelry they desire.
