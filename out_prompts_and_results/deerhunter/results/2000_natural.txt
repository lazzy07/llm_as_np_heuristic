To complete the story, we need to ensure that either Bubba ends up with the money or Bambi is dead, or both. Given the current situation, Bubba is hungry and wants money, while the clerk has money. Bambi is also present in the forest, and Bubba has a rifle loaded with ammunition.

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to the desired ending:

1. **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.** - This action is necessary because Bubba is hungry and can eat Bambi if he kills her. This will also lead to Bambi being dead, fulfilling one of the ending conditions.
   
2. **Bubba shoots Bambi.** - This action will result in Bambi being dead, which is one of the conditions we need to fulfill.

3. **Bubba decides to eat Bambi.** - After shooting Bambi, Bubba can eat her, satisfying his hunger.

4. **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.** - After eating, Bubba can go to the bank where the clerk is located.

5. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** - Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can steal the money from the clerk, achieving the other condition of having money.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

- **Bubba decides to shoot Bambi:** This action is necessary to fulfill the condition of Bambi being dead.
- **Bubba shoots Bambi:** This action directly results in Bambi's death.
- **Bubba decides to eat Bambi:** This action satisfies Bubba's hunger.
- **Bubba goes from the forest to the bank:** This action allows Bubba to reach the clerk and take the money.
- **Bubba steals the money from the clerk:** This action fulfills the condition of Bubba having money.

The final story sequence is as follows:

1. Bubba decides to shoot Bambi.
2. Bubba shoots Bambi.
3. Bubba decides to eat Bambi.
4. Bubba goes from the forest to the bank.
5. Bubba steals the money from the clerk.
