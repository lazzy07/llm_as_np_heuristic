To complete the story and ensure that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we will take the following actions:

1. **Assess Ross in Exam Room A**: Hathaway will assess Ross to determine his symptoms. This is necessary to identify whether Ross has Flaze or Jarkis, which will inform the treatment.

2. **Assess Young in Exam Room C**: After assessing Ross, Hathaway will assess Young to determine his symptoms as well. This is important to ensure that both patients are treated appropriately.

3. **Admit Jones to Exam Room B**: After assessing the other two patients, Hathaway will admit Jones to Exam Room B. This is necessary to ensure that Jones can be treated as well.

4. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: Hathaway will then assess Jones to determine his symptoms. This is crucial to identify the correct treatment for Jones.

5. **Treat Ross**: Based on the assessment of Ross, Hathaway will treat him with the appropriate treatment (antibiotics for Flaze or steroids for Jarkis). This is essential to ensure Ross becomes healthy.

6. **Treat Young**: After treating Ross, Hathaway will treat Young with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This is also necessary for Young's recovery.

7. **Treat Jones**: Finally, Hathaway will treat Jones with the appropriate treatment based on his assessment. This ensures that all patients are treated and become healthy.
