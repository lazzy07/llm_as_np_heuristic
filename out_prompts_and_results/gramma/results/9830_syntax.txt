To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **Merchant walks from Camp to Crossroads**: The Merchant needs to be at the Crossroads to interact with Tom, who is currently there.
2. **Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using a coin**: The Merchant can buy the medicine from Tom, giving him one of her coins. This action allows her to acquire an item of value while also increasing her coin count.
3. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Camp**: After the transaction, the Merchant returns to her preferred location, the Camp.

This sequence of actions allows the Merchant to achieve her goal of acquiring coins without engaging in criminal activity. 

Here’s the explanation for each action:
- **Merchant walks from Camp to Crossroads**: This is necessary for the Merchant to interact with Tom, who is at the Crossroads.
- **Merchant buys the medicine from Tom using a coin**: This action allows the Merchant to gain the medicine while also ensuring she has spent a coin, thus increasing her wealth without committing a crime.
- **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Camp**: This final action returns the Merchant to her preferred location after successfully completing her transaction.
