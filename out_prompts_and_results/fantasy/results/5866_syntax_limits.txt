In this story, Rory's goal is to be happy, wealthy, and not hungry. To achieve this, Rory needs to acquire money and treasure while ensuring he is not hungry. 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will help Rory achieve his goal:

1. **Travel from Village to Cave**: Rory travels to the cave where Talia is currently located. This is necessary because Talia has the treasure, and Rory needs to be with her to access it.

2. **Take Treasure from Talia**: Once Rory arrives at the cave, he takes the treasure from Talia. This action is essential for Rory to become wealthy, as the treasure will increase his wealth.

After these actions, Rory will have the treasure, making him wealthy, and since he is not hungry, he will achieve his goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry.
