In the cave, Talia and Rory are both present, and Gargax is hungry. Talia wants to be happy and wealthy, while Rory wants to be happy and wealthy as well. Vince, who has the money, is at the village and does not care about being rich. 

To achieve Talia's goal of becoming happy or wealthy, the following actions take place:

1. **Gargax eats Rory**: This action is necessary because Gargax is hungry and needs to eat to satisfy that hunger. By eating Rory, Gargax will also eliminate a competitor for Talia's affections, allowing her to focus on her relationship with Vince, who has the money.

2. **Talia takes the treasure**: After Gargax eats Rory, Talia can now take the treasure that is in the cave. This action is crucial because it allows Talia to become wealthy, which is one of her primary goals.

By taking these actions, Talia becomes wealthy, which fulfills her desire for wealth and contributes to her happiness.
