To achieve the bandit's goal of carrying as many coins as possible, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The bandit moves to the merchant's location to confront her and potentially rob her of her sword or coins.

2. **rob(Bandit, MerchantSword, Merchant, Merchant)**: The bandit, armed with a sword, robs the merchant, taking her sword. This action is necessary because it allows the bandit to become armed and increases her power in the story.

3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The bandit returns to the crossroads with the merchant's sword, now armed and ready to take further action.

4. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The bandit then robs Tom, taking the coins he is carrying. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to the bandit's goal of acquiring more coins.

5. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: Finally, the bandit walks back to the camp, where she can store her coins safely.

This sequence of actions ensures that the bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible by robbing both the merchant and Tom.
