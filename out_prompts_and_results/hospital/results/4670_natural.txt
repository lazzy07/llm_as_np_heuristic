**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Jones in Patient Room A to determine his symptoms. Since Jones is experiencing Unknown, Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway admits Ross to Patient Room C. This action increases Hathaway's workload to 3, but it is necessary to ensure all patients are assigned to an exam room.

Dr. Hathaway then walks to Patient Room C to assess Ross. Again, Ross is experiencing Unknown, and Hathaway cannot identify the disease.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway treats Jones in Patient Room A with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. Since Jones is actually healthy, he survives the treatment. Hathaway's workload decreases to 2.

Dr. Hathaway then treats Young in Patient Room B with steroids, believing he might have Jarkis. Young is also healthy, so he survives the treatment as well. Hathaway's workload decreases to 1.

Dr. Hathaway treats Ross in Patient Room C with antibiotics, believing he might have Flaze. However, Ross is actually healthy, so he survives the treatment too. Hathaway's workload decreases to 0.

At the end of these actions, all patients are alive and healthy, achieving Hathaway's goal.
