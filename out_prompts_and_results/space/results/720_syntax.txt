Zoe, the space explorer, is currently in the cave while the Lizard is on the surface. The surface is dangerous due to a volcano that has begun to erupt, and the Lizard is not safe there. Zoe's goal is to ensure both she and the Lizard are healthy and safe, and to make friends with the Lizard.

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe decides to approach the Lizard with the intention of making peace. Since they are not currently fighting, this action can help establish a friendship. This is crucial for Zoe to achieve her goal of making friends with the Lizard.

2. **walk(Zoe, Cave, Surface)**: After making peace, Zoe walks to the surface to join the Lizard. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to ensure they can both be safe together.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now feeling more comfortable due to the peace made with Zoe, walks to the cave where Zoe is. This action allows both characters to be in a safe location away from the erupting volcano.

4. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Once again, Zoe reinforces their friendship in the cave, ensuring that both characters feel safe and secure. This final action solidifies their relationship and ensures that they are both healthy and safe.

By following these actions, Zoe successfully achieves her goals of ensuring safety and making friends with the Lizard.
