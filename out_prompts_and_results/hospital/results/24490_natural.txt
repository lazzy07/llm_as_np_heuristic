**Story Completion:**

1. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room B.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Ross's symptoms to provide the correct treatment. Since Dr. Hathaway's workload is 3, there is a risk of making a mistake, but assessing Ross is necessary to move forward.

2. **Dr. Hathaway treats Ross for Flaze.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Dr. Hathaway mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze (due to the high workload), he administers antibiotics. If Ross actually has Flaze, this will make him healthy.

3. **Dr. Hathaway walks to Admissions.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to check on the other patients, specifically Jones and Young, who are still in Admissions.

4. **Dr. Hathaway admits Young to Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: This action is necessary to ensure Young is assigned to an exam room for assessment and treatment.

5. **Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room A.**  
   - Explanation: Dr. Hathaway needs to determine Young's symptoms to provide the correct treatment.

6. **Dr. Hathaway treats Young for Jarkis.**  
   - Explanation: Assuming Dr. Hathaway correctly identifies Young's symptoms as a rash, he administers steroids, which will make Young healthy.

**Final Outcome:**  
- Ross is healthy after being treated for Flaze.  
- Young is healthy after being treated for Jarkis.  
- Jones remains in Admissions but is alive.
