**Story Completion:**

After finishing his chores in the laundry, Roy, disguised in civilian clothes, decides to take a risk. He knows that Ernest is in the gym with the bully, who has been threatening them both. Roy moves quickly through the hallway and crawls through the vents to reach the gym. Once inside, he locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. 

With the bully trapped, Roy takes out the knife he had previously stolen from the kitchen. He confronts the bully, who is surprised and unable to defend himself. In a moment of desperation, Roy kills the bully, ensuring that he and Ernest are no longer threatened.
