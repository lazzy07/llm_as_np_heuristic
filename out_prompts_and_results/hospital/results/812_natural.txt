**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Patient Room C to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Dr. Hathaway, with a workload of 1, is able to accurately assess Ross without making a mistake. Upon assessment, Dr. Hathaway discovers that Ross has a fever, indicating he has Flaze. 

Dr. Hathaway then treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. As a result, Ross becomes healthy.
