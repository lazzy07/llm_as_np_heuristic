To ensure the Merchant achieves her goal of acquiring as many coins as possible without becoming a criminal, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Camp, Crossroads)**: The Bandit moves from the Bandit Camp to the Crossroads, where she can potentially encounter Tom and the Merchant.

2. **walk(Tom, Camp, Crossroads)**: Tom moves from the Camp to the Crossroads, where he can meet the Merchant and the Bandit.

3. **rob(Bandit, TomCoin, Tom, Crossroads)**: The Bandit, armed with a sword, robs Tom of the coin he has. This action is possible because Tom is not armed. The Bandit now has one coin.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Camp)**: The Bandit returns to the Camp with the stolen coin.

5. **take(Merchant, TomCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Merchant, now at the Camp, takes the coin from the Bandit’s chest. This action is valid as the Merchant is not a criminal and is taking from the chest, not robbing.

At this point, the Merchant has successfully acquired a coin without committing a crime, achieving her goal.
