To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Alex gets the item they want, which is the flowers (I1). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R12, R21)**: Alex moves to the dining room where the flowers are located. This is necessary because Alex needs to be in the same room as the flowers to pick them up.

2. **pick_up(C1, I1, R21)**: Alex picks up the flowers. This action is essential for Alex to obtain the item they want.

3. **move(C1, R21, R12)**: Alex moves back to the living room. This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but helps to keep the story flowing and allows for potential interactions with other characters.

4. **give(C1, I1, C2, R12)**: Alex gives the flowers to Casey. This action is included to ensure that Casey is also happy, as Casey wants the chocolates (I2) and Alex wants Casey to be happy.

5. **move(C2, R12, R21)**: Casey moves to the dining room to get the chocolates. This action is necessary for Casey to achieve their happiness.

6. **pick_up(C2, I2, R21)**: Casey picks up the chocolates. This is essential for Casey to achieve their goal of happiness.

7. **move(C2, R21, R12)**: Casey moves back to the living room. This action is included for continuity and potential interactions.

8. **give(C2, I2, C3, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates to Blake. This action ensures that Blake can also achieve their happiness.

9. **move(C3, R12, R21)**: Blake moves to the dining room to get the jewelry. This action is necessary for Blake to achieve their happiness.

10. **pick_up(C3, I3, R21)**: Blake picks up the jewelry. This is essential for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness.

Now, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Casey is happy because they have the chocolates, and Blake is happy because they have the jewelry.
