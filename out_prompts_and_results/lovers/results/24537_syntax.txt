To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy, we need to make sure Blake gets the item they want, which is the chocolates (I2). Currently, Blake (C2) is in the dining room (R22) and does not have the chocolates, while Casey (C3) is in the living room (R12) and has the jewelry (I3). 

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's happiness:

1. **move(C2, R22, R12)**: Blake moves to the living room where Casey is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Casey to interact with them.

2. **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: Casey gives the chocolates (I2) to Blake. This action is essential as it directly fulfills Blake's desire for the chocolates, making Blake happy.

After these actions, Blake will have the chocolates, achieving their goal of happiness.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **move(C2, R22, R12)**: This action is necessary for Blake to reach Casey, who has the item Blake wants.
- **give(C3, I2, C2, R12)**: This action is crucial as it allows Blake to receive the chocolates, which is the item Blake desires to be happy.
