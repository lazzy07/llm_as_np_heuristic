Zoe, realizing that the Lizard is the guardian of the planet and that they both want to be healthy and safe, decides to make peace with the Lizard. She knows that the surface is dangerous due to the volcano that has begun to erupt, and she wants to ensure both of their safety. 

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Cave)**: Zoe approaches the Lizard and expresses her desire to be friends, emphasizing their shared goals of health and safety. This action is crucial as it establishes a positive relationship between them, which is necessary for both characters to feel safe and secure.

2. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Cave, Ship)**: After making peace, Zoe teleports back to her spaceship, ensuring her safety from the erupting volcano. This action is necessary for her to avoid danger while still maintaining her new friendship with the Lizard.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard, now feeling more secure with Zoe as a friend, walks back to the cave to stay safe from the eruption. This action reinforces the bond they have formed and ensures that both characters are safe.

By making peace, Zoe achieves her goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in the Lizard.
