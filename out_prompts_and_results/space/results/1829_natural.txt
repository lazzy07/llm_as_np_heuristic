Zoe and the Lizard, now friends, realize that the surface is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the erupting volcano. They decide to take action to ensure their safety and the safety of the planet.

1. **Zoe teleports from the cave to the surface.** - Zoe wants to assess the situation on the surface and see if there is any way to help the Lizard protect the planet.
   
2. **The volcano on the surface erupts.** - This is a natural event that occurs as part of the story's setting, creating immediate danger for Zoe.

3. **Zoe is killed by the eruption.** - This action fulfills the requirement of a character dying due to the eruption, which is a consequence of the previous action.

4. **The Lizard walks from the cave to the surface.** - The Lizard, concerned for Zoe, comes to the surface to see what has happened.

5. **The Lizard makes peace with Zoe.** - Even though Zoe has died, the Lizard reflects on their friendship and the bond they formed, symbolically making peace with her memory.

This sequence of actions leads to the eruption of the volcano, resulting in Zoe's death, while also highlighting the friendship that was formed between Zoe and the Lizard.
