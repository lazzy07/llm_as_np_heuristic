To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army ends up with the Ark of the Covenant and that the Nazis are dead. Given the current situation, the Nazis have already opened the Ark, which was dangerous, resulting in their deaths. The US Army is still alive and in the USA, and Indiana Jones is also alive in the USA.

Here’s the sequence of actions to achieve the desired ending:

1. **give(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army, believing that the Ark is with the Nazis, can give the Ark to Indiana Jones, who is in the USA. This action is necessary because it allows Indiana to have the Ark without any conflict, as the Nazis are already dead.

2. **give(Jones, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: Indiana Jones can then give the Ark to the US Army. This action is necessary to fulfill the goal of the US Army having the Ark.

Now, let's summarize the actions and their purposes:

1. **give(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army gives the Ark to Indiana Jones, who is alive and in the USA. This is possible because the Nazis are dead, and the Ark is no longer a threat.
   
2. **give(Jones, Ark, USArmy, USA)**: Indiana Jones then gives the Ark to the US Army, ensuring that the Army now possesses the Ark.

At the end of these actions, the US Army has the Ark of the Covenant, and the Nazis are dead, achieving the desired outcome.
