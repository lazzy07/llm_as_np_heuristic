In this story, Hathaway, the doctor, is focused on ensuring all patients are healthy. Given the current situation, the following actions will help achieve this goal:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway will assess Young in the admissions room to determine if they are showing any symptoms. This is necessary because Young is currently unassigned to an exam room, and Hathaway needs to know if Young has a disease that requires treatment.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, if they show symptoms of either Flaze or Jarkis, Hathaway will admit Young to Exam Room B. This action is crucial as it allows Hathaway to treat Young based on their symptoms, ensuring that all patients are healthy.

Here’s the complete story with the actions explained:

1. **Assess Young**: Hathaway walks to the admissions room where Young is located and assesses them. If Young shows symptoms of either disease, Hathaway can then proceed to treat them accordingly.

2. **Admit Young to Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway admits them to Exam Room B. This action allows Hathaway to treat Young based on the symptoms observed, ensuring that they receive the correct treatment and become healthy.

By following these actions, Hathaway can ensure that all patients, including Young, are treated properly, thus achieving their goal of having all hospital patients healthy.
