In the living room, Alex, Blake, and Casey are all feeling unhappy because they do not have the items they want. Alex wants the flowers, Blake wants the chocolates, and Casey wants the jewelry. 

To achieve their goal, Blake decides to take action. Since Blake believes that the chocolates are in the bathroom, Blake moves from the living room to the bathroom to find the chocolates. 

This action is necessary because it allows Blake to pursue their goal of obtaining the chocolates, which will make Blake happy. 

After Blake moves to the bathroom, they can search for the chocolates, which is the next logical step in the story. However, since the goal is to keep the story short and focused on Blake achieving their goal, we will stop here.
