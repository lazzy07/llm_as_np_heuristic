To complete the story, we need to ensure that the US Army retains possession of the Ark of the Covenant and that the Nazis are dead. Given the current situation, the Nazis are already dead, and the US Army has the Ark. Therefore, the story can conclude without any further actions, as the desired ending has already been achieved.

Here’s the explanation of the actions taken in the story:

1. **travel(Jones, USA, Tanis)**: Indiana Jones travels to Tanis to find the Ark.
2. **dig(Jones, Ark, Tanis)**: Indiana digs up the Ark in Tanis, believing it to be there.
3. **take(Nazis, Ark, Jones, Tanis)**: The Nazis take the Ark from Indiana, believing it to be theirs.
4. **open(Nazis, Ark, Tanis)**: The Nazis open the Ark, which is dangerous, leading to their deaths.
5. **take(Jones, Ark, Nazis, Tanis)**: Indiana takes the Ark back from the dead Nazis.
6. **travel(Jones, Tanis, USA)**: Indiana travels back to the USA with the Ark.
7. **take(USArmy, Ark, Jones, USA)**: The US Army takes the Ark from Indiana, ensuring they have it.

At this point, the US Army has the Ark, and the Nazis are dead, fulfilling the story's requirements.
