To achieve Alex's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Alex has the item they want, which is I1 (the flowers). The following actions will help achieve this:

1. **move(C1, R22, R21)**: Alex moves from the dining room (R22) to the bathroom (R21) to get the item they want, which is in the bathroom.
2. **pick_up(C1, I2, R21)**: Alex picks up the chocolates (I2) in the bathroom, which is not their desired item but is necessary for the next step.
3. **move(C1, R21, R22)**: Alex moves back to the dining room (R22) with the chocolates.
4. **give(C1, I2, C2, R22)**: Alex gives the chocolates to Casey, who wants them. This action helps to create goodwill and may lead to a trade or further actions that benefit Alex.
5. **move(C2, R22, R21)**: Casey moves to the bathroom (R21) to retrieve the flowers (I1).
6. **pick_up(C2, I1, R21)**: Casey picks up the flowers (I1) from the bathroom.
7. **move(C2, R21, R22)**: Casey moves back to the dining room (R22) with the flowers.
8. **give(C2, I1, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the flowers (I1) to Alex, fulfilling Alex's desire and making them happy.
