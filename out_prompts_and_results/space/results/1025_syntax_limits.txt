Zoe and the Lizard stand on the surface of the planet, having just made peace with each other. Both characters want to be healthy and safe and to make friends. The surface is dangerous, and they need to find a way to ensure their safety.

1. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano on the surface begins to erupt, creating an immediate threat to both Zoe and the Lizard. This action is necessary to heighten the urgency of their situation and to prompt them to take action to ensure their safety.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: Zoe decides to walk to the cave, which is a safer location away from the erupting volcano. This action is taken to escape the danger of the eruption and to find a place where they can be safe.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard follows Zoe into the cave, ensuring that both characters are now in a safe location away from the erupting volcano. This action solidifies their friendship as they work together to find safety.

By taking these actions, both Zoe and the Lizard achieve their goals of being healthy and safe while also strengthening their friendship.
