**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway, despite being overwhelmed with a workload of 3, decides to assess Jones in Patient Room A. She observes that Jones is experiencing Fever, which indicates he has Flaze. Knowing the treatment for Flaze is antibiotics, she treats Jones accordingly. This successfully makes Jones healthy.

Next, Dr. Hathaway realizes that Ross is still in the admissions room and has not been assessed yet. She walks to the admissions room to admit Ross to an exam room. She assigns Ross to Patient Room B. 

After admitting Ross, Dr. Hathaway returns to Patient Room B to assess him. However, due to her increased workload, she mistakenly believes Ross has Flaze instead of the unknown condition he is experiencing. She treats Ross with antibiotics, which unfortunately does not match his actual condition, leading to his demise.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway goes to Patient Room C to admit Young. She assesses Young and finds that he is also experiencing an unknown condition. Again, due to her workload, she mistakenly believes Young has Flaze and treats him with antibiotics, which also leads to his demise.

Despite the unfortunate outcomes for Ross and Young, Dr. Hathaway successfully treated Jones, achieving her goal of ensuring at least one patient is healthy.
