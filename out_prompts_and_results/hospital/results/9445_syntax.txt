To complete the story while ensuring that Hathaway achieves their goal of making all hospital patients healthy, we need to take the following actions:

1. **Assess Young in Exam Room A**: Hathaway needs to assess Young to determine their symptoms. This is crucial because without knowing the symptoms, Hathaway cannot provide the correct treatment.

2. **Assess Jones in Exam Room B**: After assessing Young, Hathaway should assess Jones next. This will help Hathaway understand Jones's condition and provide appropriate treatment.

3. **Assess Ross in Exam Room C**: Finally, Hathaway should assess Ross. This completes the assessment of all patients, allowing Hathaway to know the symptoms of each patient.

4. **Treat Young with Antibiotics**: If Young is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat them with antibiotics to ensure they become healthy.

5. **Treat Jones with Steroids**: If Jones is diagnosed with Jarkis (rash), Hathaway should treat them with steroids to ensure they become healthy.

6. **Treat Ross with Antibiotics**: If Ross is diagnosed with Flaze (fever), Hathaway should treat them with antibiotics to ensure they become healthy.
