To achieve Gargax's goal of being wealthy and not hungry, the story will focus on Gargax's actions to acquire money and satisfy his hunger. Hereâ€™s the completed story:

1. **Gargax travels from the village to the cave.**  
   - Gargax needs to return to the cave where the treasure is located, as he believes it will help him achieve his goal of wealth.

2. **Gargax picks up the treasure.**  
   - Gargax already has the treasure, so this action is unnecessary. Instead, he should focus on acquiring money.

3. **Gargax travels from the cave to the village.**  
   - Gargax needs to go back to the village to confront Rory, who is alive and has no treasure but has the money.

4. **Gargax eats Rory.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to eliminate Rory and take the money from him, satisfying Gargax's hunger and achieving his goal of wealth.

5. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's body.**  
   - After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money, which fulfills his desire to be wealthy.

At this point, Gargax has achieved his goal of being wealthy (by acquiring both the treasure and the money) and is no longer hungry (after eating Rory).

### Explanation of Actions:
