In the current situation, the villain has already established control over the President by bribing him with Money. The hero, fearing the villain, is in a position where they cannot directly confront the villain or the President. The villain's goal is to ensure that Unknown has Money, which aligns with the President's desire as well.

To complete the story, the villain can take the following action:

1. **The villain gives Money to Unknown.** This action fulfills the villain's goal of ensuring that Unknown has Money, while also maintaining control over the President, who is now complicit in the villain's scheme.

This single action is sufficient to conclude the story, as it reinforces the villain's control over the President and achieves the desired outcome without any further complications.

### Explanation of the Action:
- **The villain gives Money to Unknown:** This action is necessary because it directly fulfills the villain's goal of ensuring that Unknown has Money. By doing this, the villain solidifies their power and influence, as the President is already under their control due to the previous bribe. The hero's desire for the villain to have Money does not interfere with this action, as it aligns with the villain's objectives.
