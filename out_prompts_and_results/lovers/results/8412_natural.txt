To ensure Casey achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the jewelry, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake moves from the bathroom to the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary for Blake to be in the same room as Casey and the jewelry, allowing for potential interaction.

2. **Blake picks up the jewelry in the living room.**  
   - Blake needs to pick up the jewelry to facilitate a trade or give it to Casey, as Casey wants the jewelry.

3. **Blake gives the jewelry to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action directly fulfills Casey's desire for the jewelry, making Casey happy.

After these actions, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is in the living room and is still not happy because they do not have the flowers.
- Blake is in the living room and is not happy because they do not have the chocolates.
- Casey is in the living room and is now happy because they have the jewelry.

This sequence of actions is the shortest path to ensure Casey achieves their goal of happiness.
