To ensure Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also wanting Alex to be happy, we need to focus on the items and the current situation. 

1. **Action: move(C2, R21, R22)** - Blake (C2) moves to the room where Alex (C1) is located. This is necessary because Blake needs to be in the same room as Alex to interact with them.

2. **Action: give(C2, I2, C1, R22)** - Blake gives the item (I2, which is chocolates) to Alex. This is crucial because Alex wants I1 (flowers), but by giving I2 to Alex, Blake can ensure that Alex is happy, which is part of Blake's goal.

3. **Action: move(C3, R22, R21)** - Casey (C3) moves to the room where Blake is now located. This is necessary for Casey to interact with Blake and potentially trade or give items.

4. **Action: trade(C3, I3, C2, I2, R21)** - Casey trades their item (I3, which is jewelry) for the chocolates (I2) from Blake. This is important because it allows Casey to achieve their happiness by obtaining the item they want.

5. **Action: give(C3, I3, C2, R21)** - Casey gives the jewelry (I3) back to Blake. This is necessary for Blake to achieve their happiness since they now have the item they want.

After these actions, the happiness status is as follows:
- Alex is happy because they received chocolates (I2).
- Blake is happy because they received jewelry (I3).
- Casey is happy because they received chocolates (I2).

Thus, Blake achieves their goal of being happy while also ensuring Alex is happy.
