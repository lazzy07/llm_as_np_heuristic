To ensure Alex achieves their goal of being happy by obtaining the flowers, the following actions will take place:

1. **Blake picks up the flowers in the living room.**  
   - This action is necessary because Blake currently has the flowers, and Alex wants them. By picking them up, Blake can then give them to Alex.

2. **Blake gives the flowers to Alex in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to fulfill Alex's desire for the flowers, making Alex happy.

3. **Blake moves to the dining room.**  
   - This action is not strictly necessary for Alex's happiness but allows Blake to pursue their own goal of obtaining the chocolates.

4. **Blake picks up the chocolates in the dining room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to achieve their own goal of being happy.

5. **Blake moves back to the living room.**  
   - This action is to return to the living room where Alex is, allowing for further interaction.

6. **Blake gives the chocolates to Casey in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Blake to help Casey achieve their goal of happiness, as Casey wants the jewelry.

7. **Casey gives the jewelry to Blake in the living room.**  
   - This action allows Casey to achieve their goal of happiness, as they want the jewelry.

At the end of these actions, Alex is happy because they have the flowers, Blake is happy because they have the chocolates, and Casey is happy because they have the jewelry.
