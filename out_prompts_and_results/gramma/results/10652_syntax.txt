To ensure the Bandit achieves her goal of carrying as many coins as possible or having coins in the chest at the bandit camp, the following sequence of actions will take place:

1. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Merchant)**: The Bandit walks to the Merchant's location to attempt to rob her. This is necessary because the Merchant has the medicine that Tom wants, and the Bandit can take advantage of the situation.

2. **rob(Bandit, Medicine, Merchant, Merchant)**: The Bandit robs the Merchant, taking the medicine. This action is crucial as it allows the Bandit to gain an item that could be valuable in the future, and it also puts the Merchant in a vulnerable position.

3. **walk(Bandit, Merchant, Crossroads)**: The Bandit walks back to the Crossroads after robbing the Merchant. This is necessary to regroup and prepare for the next action.

4. **walk(Bandit, Crossroads, Bandit Camp)**: The Bandit walks to the Bandit Camp to store the medicine and any coins she may have. This is essential for achieving her goal of having coins in the chest at the camp.

5. **take(Bandit, BanditCoin, Chest, Camp)**: The Bandit takes the coins from her possession and places them in the chest at the Bandit Camp. This final action ensures that the Bandit has successfully achieved her goal of having coins in the chest.
