To ensure Rory achieves their goal of being happy, wealthy, and not hungry, we need to focus on actions that will allow him to acquire wealth and maintain his happiness. Since Rory is already married to Talia, he has achieved happiness through that relationship. The key to achieving wealth lies in acquiring the treasure located in the cave.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions that will lead to Rory achieving his goal:

1. **travel(Rory, Cave, Village)**: Rory travels from the cave to the village to be with Talia and Vince, as he needs to strategize on how to acquire the treasure.
2. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: Vince travels to the cave to help Rory with the treasure acquisition.
3. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure from the cave, which is essential for Rory's wealth.
4. **take(Rory, Treasure, Vince, Cave)**: Rory takes the treasure from Vince, ensuring that he now possesses the treasure.
5. **pickup(Rory, Money, Village)**: Rory picks up the money that Vince had, which adds to his wealth.

After these actions, Rory will have both the treasure and the money, fulfilling his goal of being wealthy. He is already happy due to his marriage to Talia, and he is not hungry.
