**Story Completion:**

After venting into the gym, Ernest finds himself in a precarious situation with the bully. Knowing that he is threatened and needs to secure his safety, he decides to take action. 

Ernest, armed with the knife he stole from the kitchen, locks the gym door to prevent the bully from escaping. This action ensures that he can confront the bully without the risk of being interrupted or attacked by others.
