To complete the story, we need to ensure that Talia becomes happy or wealthy or both. Given the current situation, Talia is married to both Rory and Vince, but Vince is dead. Rory is alive, and Gargax is hungry and present in the village. The treasure is located in the cave, and Vince has the money.

### Story Completion:

1. **Gargax eats Rory.**

2. **Gargax takes the money from Rory's body.**  
   - After eating Rory, Gargax can take the money from Rory's body. This action is necessary for Gargax to become wealthy, but it also clears the way for Talia to pursue her goals without the interference of Rory.

3. **Gargax travels to the cave.**

4. **Gargax picks up the treasure in the cave.**  
   - This action allows Gargax to become wealthy by acquiring the treasure. 

5. **Gargax returns to the village.**  
   - Gargax returns to the village with the treasure, which is necessary for the final resolution of Talia's situation.

6. **Gargax gives Talia the treasure.**  
   - Gargax gives the treasure to Talia, which makes her wealthy. This action is crucial for Talia to achieve her goal of becoming wealthy.

7. **Talia becomes happy.**  
   - With the treasure, Talia achieves her goal of wealth, which in turn makes her happy.
