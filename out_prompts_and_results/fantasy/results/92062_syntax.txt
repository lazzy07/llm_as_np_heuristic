To ensure Talia becomes happy or wealthy, we can focus on her relationships and the items available. Since Talia has accepted proposals from both Rory and Vince, she can marry one of them, which will make her happy. Additionally, Vince has money, which can contribute to her wealth.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve Talia's happiness:

1. **marry(Vince, Talia, Village)**: Talia marries Vince, which makes her happy. This is essential because Talia's goal is to be happy, and marriage to Vince fulfills that requirement.

2. **travel(Vince, Village, Cave)**: After marrying, Vince can travel to the cave where the treasure is located. This action is necessary for Vince to access the treasure, which can contribute to Talia's wealth.

3. **pickup(Vince, Treasure, Cave)**: Vince picks up the treasure in the cave. This is important because it adds to his wealth, which can be shared with Talia, thus contributing to her goal of being wealthy.

4. **travel(Vince, Cave, Village)**: Vince returns to the village with the treasure. This action is necessary to bring the treasure back to Talia.

5. **give(Vince, Treasure, Talia, Village)**: Vince gives the treasure to Talia. This action is crucial as it directly contributes to Talia's wealth.

After these actions, Talia will be both happy (from marrying Vince) and wealthy (from receiving the treasure).
