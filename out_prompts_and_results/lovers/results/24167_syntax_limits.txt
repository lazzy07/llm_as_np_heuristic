In the current situation, Alex (C1) wants item I1 (flowers), Casey (C3) wants item I3 (jewelry), and Blake (C2) wants item I2 (chocolates). The goal is for Alex to achieve happiness by obtaining the flowers.

1. **Action: trade(C1, I1, C2, I2, R22)** - Alex trades the flowers (I1) they want with Blake for the chocolates (I2). This action is necessary because it allows Alex to obtain the item they desire, which is the flowers, while also ensuring that Blake receives an item they want, thus keeping both characters happy.

After this action, the situation is as follows:
- Alex is now happy because they have the flowers.
- Blake is happy because they have the chocolates.
- Casey remains unhappy because they still do not have the jewelry.

This single action achieves Alex's goal of happiness.
