In this story, Zoe is on the surface of the planet, and the Lizard is in the cave. The volcano has already begun to erupt, making the surface dangerous. Zoe wants to be healthy and safe and to make friends with the Lizard, while the Lizard also desires safety and friendship.

To achieve the ending where the volcano erupts and one character dies, we can have Zoe take the action of teleporting to the spaceship, which will anger the Lizard. This action will lead to a fight, and since the volcano is erupting, it will create a dangerous situation for Zoe.

Here’s the sequence of actions:

1. **teleport_to_ship(Zoe, Surface, Ship)**: Zoe teleports back to the spaceship, which angers the Lizard. This action is necessary because it puts Zoe in a position where she is not on the surface anymore, but it also creates tension with the Lizard.

2. **teleport_from_ship(Zoe, Ship, Surface)**: Zoe teleports back to the surface, which again angers the Lizard. This action is necessary to bring Zoe back into the dangerous environment where the volcano is erupting.

3. **begin_erupt(Surface)**: The volcano begins to erupt, creating a dangerous situation for both characters. This action is necessary to set the stage for the potential death of one character.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, killing Zoe. This action is necessary to fulfill the requirement of a character dying.

5. **make_peace(Lizard, Zoe, Surface)**: Although Zoe is dead, the Lizard can reflect on the situation and decide to make peace with Zoe's memory, symbolizing a friendship that could have been. This action is necessary to show that despite the tragic outcome, the Lizard's desire for friendship remains.

The final story ends with the volcano erupting, resulting in Zoe's death, while the Lizard makes peace, indicating a desire for friendship.
