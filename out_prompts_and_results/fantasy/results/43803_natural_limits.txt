In this story, Vince's goal is to be happy and not hungry, and he currently has the money but no treasure. To achieve his goal, he needs to ensure he has enough wealth and happiness. 

Here's the shortest story where Vince achieves his goal:

1. **Vince travels from the village to the cave.** - This action is necessary for Vince to reach the location where the treasure is located, which is essential for increasing his wealth.

2. **Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.** - By picking up the treasure, Vince increases his wealth, which is a step towards achieving his goal of being happy and not hungry.

3. **Vince becomes hungry.** - This action is included to show that Vince's hunger status changes, but it does not affect his goal since he has already achieved wealth.

4. **Vince eats Talia.** - This action is included to ensure that Vince is no longer hungry, as he can eat a human at his location. Since Talia is at the village and Vince is at the cave, this action is not possible. Therefore, we will skip this action.

5. **Vince proposes to Talia.** - This action is included to increase Vince's happiness through a marriage proposal.

6. **Talia accepts Vince's proposal.** - This action is included to ensure that both characters are happy.

7. **Vince and Talia get married.** - This action solidifies their relationship and increases Vince's happiness.

Now, let's summarize the actions taken:

1. Vince travels from the village to the cave.
2. Vince picks up the treasure at the cave.
3. Vince proposes to Talia.
4. Talia accepts Vince's proposal.
5. Vince and Talia get married.
