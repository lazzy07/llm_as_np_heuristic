To achieve Blake's goal of being happy, we need to ensure that Blake gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I2). The current situation shows that I2 is not in any room, but Casey (C3) has it. Since Casey wants to be happy and also wants Blake to be happy, we can facilitate a trade between Casey and Blake.

Hereâ€™s the sequence of actions to achieve this:

1. **move(C3, R22, R12)**: Casey moves from the living room (R22) to the dining room (R12) where Alex (C1) and Casey (C2) are located. This is necessary for Casey to be in the same room as Blake to facilitate the trade.

2. **trade(C3, I2, C1, I3, R12)**: Casey trades the jewelry (I2) with Alex for the flowers (I3) in the dining room (R12). This action is crucial because it allows Blake to receive the item they want, which is the jewelry.

3. **move(C1, R12, R22)**: Alex moves to the living room (R22) to be with Blake. This is necessary for Blake to be happy since they want to be with Alex.

4. **give(C3, I2, C1, R22)**: Casey gives the jewelry (I2) to Alex in the living room (R22). This action ensures that Alex now has the jewelry, which is what Blake wants.

5. **give(C1, I2, C3, R22)**: Alex gives the jewelry (I2) to Blake in the living room (R22). This final action makes Blake happy because they now have the item they wanted.

After these actions, Blake is happy because they have the jewelry (I2), which is their desired item.
