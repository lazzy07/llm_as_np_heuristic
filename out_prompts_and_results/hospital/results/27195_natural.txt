**Story Completion:**

Dr. Hathaway assesses Young in Patient Room C to determine their symptoms. Since Young is experiencing Unknown, Dr. Hathaway cannot identify the disease yet. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload is still manageable at 2, so there is no risk of making a mistake.

Next, Dr. Hathaway treats Young with steroids, believing they might have Jarkis, as the symptoms are unknown. This is a gamble, but it is the only option available to help Young. Fortunately, Young does not have Jarkis, but the treatment does not harm them either.

After treating Young, Dr. Hathaway walks back to Admissions to assess Jones and Ross. Dr. Hathaway admits Jones to Patient Room B, increasing the workload to 3. Dr. Hathaway then assesses Jones, who is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. 

Dr. Hathaway treats Jones with antibiotics, believing they might have Flaze. This is a mistake, as Jones does not have Flaze, but the treatment is administered nonetheless. Unfortunately, Jones dies due to the incorrect treatment.

Finally, Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross in Admissions. Ross is also experiencing Unknown symptoms. Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with steroids, believing they might have Jarkis. This treatment is correct, and Ross becomes healthy.

In the end, Dr. Hathaway has successfully treated Ross, achieving their goal of ensuring that at least one patient is healthy.
