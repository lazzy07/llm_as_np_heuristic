In the cave, Gargax, feeling hungry, decides to eat Vince, who is nearby. After eating Vince, Gargax finds the money that Vince had and takes it for himself. With Vince gone, Talia and Rory are left together. Since Talia is now married to Rory, her happiness increases as they share a bond. 

This series of actions leads to Talia becoming happy because she is now in a relationship with Rory, and the absence of Vince allows her to focus on her marriage. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the actions:
1. Gargax eats Vince: This action is necessary because it removes Vince from the story, allowing Talia to focus on her relationship with Rory, which is crucial for her happiness.
2. Gargax takes the money: This action is included to show that Gargax has achieved his goal of wealth, but it does not directly affect Talia's happiness.
3. Talia's happiness increases due to her marriage to Rory: This is the final outcome that fulfills the requirement of Talia becoming happy.
