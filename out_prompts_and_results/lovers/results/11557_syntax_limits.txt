In this story, Blake wants to be happy and also wants Alex to be happy. To achieve this, Blake needs to ensure that Alex gets the item they want, which is the jewelry (I1). 

Here’s the sequence of actions that will lead to Blake's goal:

1. **trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)**: Blake (C2) trades the chocolates (I3) they have with Alex (C1) for the jewelry (I1) that Alex has. This action is crucial because it allows Blake to give Alex the item they want, which will make Alex happy. Since Blake wants Alex to be happy, this action directly contributes to Blake's goal.

After this action, the situation will be as follows:
- Alex will have the jewelry (I1) and will be happy.
- Blake will have the chocolates (I3) but will be happy because they have made Alex happy.

Here’s the final plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": ["trade(C2, I3, C1, I1, R22)"]
}
``` 

This plan is the shortest and most effective way for Blake to achieve their goal of happiness by ensuring Alex is happy with the item they desire.
