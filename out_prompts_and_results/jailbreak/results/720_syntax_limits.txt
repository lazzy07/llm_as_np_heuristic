**Story Completion:**

After completing their chores, Roy, who is in the kitchen, decides to take action to ensure both he and Ernest can escape the prison. Knowing that the bully is currently in the gym and that he has the pack of cigarettes, Roy quickly formulates a plan. He stealthily moves to the laundry room where he knows Ernest is located. 

Once in the laundry room, Roy steals the civilian clothes. This action is crucial because it allows him to disguise himself for a potential escape. With the clothes in hand, he then goes to the hallway.
