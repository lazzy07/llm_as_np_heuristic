To ensure that the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy, safe, and making friends with other creatures, the following actions will be taken:

1. **make_peace(Zoe, Lizard, Surface)**: Since Zoe and the Lizard are already not fighting and have a positive relationship, they can solidify their friendship. This action is crucial as it aligns with both characters' goals of making friends and ensures a cooperative atmosphere.

2. **walk(Zoe, Surface, Cave)**: After making peace, Zoe can walk to the cave where the Lizard is. This action is necessary for Zoe to be in the same location as the Lizard to further their friendship and ensure safety from the erupting volcano.

3. **walk(Lizard, Surface, Cave)**: The Lizard can also walk to the cave, ensuring both characters are together in a safe location away from the danger of the volcano.

4. **erupt(Surface)**: The volcano erupts, but since both characters are now in the cave, they are safe from the eruption. This action demonstrates the danger of the surface and reinforces the need for both characters to stay together in a safe location.

By following these actions, the Lizard achieves its goal of being healthy and safe while also making a friend in Zoe.
