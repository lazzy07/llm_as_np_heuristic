To complete the story, we need to ensure that Bubba achieves his goal of having 1 money. The simplest way for Bubba to achieve this is to steal the money from the bank clerk, as he has a loaded rifle. Hereâ€™s how the story unfolds:

1. **Bubba decides to steal the money from the clerk.** (Bubba wants to have money, and stealing is a direct way to achieve that goal.)
2. **Bubba steals the money from the clerk.** (Since Bubba has a loaded rifle, he can successfully steal the money without any resistance.)
3. **Bubba goes from the bank to the house.** (Bubba wants to leave the bank after achieving his goal.)

After these actions, Bubba will have 1 money, which fulfills his goal.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Decide to steal:** This action is necessary for Bubba to take the money from the clerk, as it aligns with his goal of acquiring money.
- **Steal the money:** This action directly results in Bubba obtaining the money he desires.
- **Go to the house:** This action is not strictly necessary for achieving the goal but serves to conclude the story by moving Bubba away from the bank after he has successfully stolen the money.
