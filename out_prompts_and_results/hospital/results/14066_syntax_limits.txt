In this story, we will focus on Ross, who is currently in Exam Room A. The goal is for Ross to be treated successfully and achieve health. Given that Hathaway's workload is currently at 3, there is a risk of making a mistake if he assesses or treats Ross. Therefore, we will first have Hathaway walk to the admissions room to reduce his workload before assessing and treating Ross.

1. **Action: walk(Hathaway, PatientRoomA, Admissions)**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway walks to the admissions room to reduce his workload from 3 to 2. This action is necessary to minimize the risk of making a mistake when assessing or treating Ross.

2. **Action: walk(Hathaway, Admissions, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway returns to Exam Room A to assess Ross. His workload is now manageable, allowing him to accurately assess Ross's symptoms.

3. **Action: assess(Hathaway, Ross, symptom, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. This is crucial for identifying the correct treatment for Ross.

4. **Action: treat(Hathaway, Ross, treatment, PatientRoomA)**  
   - Explanation: After assessing Ross, Hathaway treats him with the appropriate treatment based on the symptoms identified. This action ensures that Ross becomes healthy.

By following these actions, Ross successfully achieves his goal of being alive and healthy.
