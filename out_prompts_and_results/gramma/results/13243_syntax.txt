To achieve the goal of the Merchant, who wants to get as many coins as she can without becoming a criminal, we can outline the following sequence of actions:

1. **Merchant walks from Cottage to Crossroads**: The Merchant needs to move to a location where she can interact with other characters and potentially sell her medicine.

2. **Merchant sells the medicine to Tom for 2 coins**: Tom, who is at the Crossroads, wants to carry the medicine back to the Cottage. The Merchant can sell the medicine to Tom for 2 coins, which helps her achieve her goal of acquiring coins without committing a crime.

3. **Merchant walks from Crossroads to Cottage**: After the transaction, the Merchant can return to the Cottage, where she can safely store her coins and avoid any potential conflict with the Guard or Bandit.

This sequence of actions ensures that the Merchant achieves her goal of obtaining coins without engaging in criminal activity.
