Dr. Hathaway, wanting all hospital patients to be healthy, decides to assess Ross in Patient Room A. Since Ross is the only patient assigned to that room, Hathaway can focus on him without increasing her workload significantly. 

1. **Assess Ross in Patient Room A**: Dr. Hathaway assesses Ross to determine his symptoms. Since Ross is experiencing unknown symptoms, Hathaway will have to make a decision based on her knowledge of the two diseases. Given that Ross is the only patient in the room, she can safely assume he is not experiencing Flaze (fever) or Jarkis (rash) without any visible symptoms. However, she will treat him for Flaze, as it is the more common disease.

2. **Treat Ross for Flaze**: Dr. Hathaway treats Ross with antibiotics, which is the correct treatment for Flaze. Since Ross does not actually have Flaze, this treatment is a mistake, but it is the only option available to Hathaway at this moment. 

3. **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: Dr. Hathaway then admits Young to Patient Room B, allowing her to assess him next. This action does not directly affect Ross's health but ensures that Young will be treated promptly.

After these actions, Ross is treated, but he does not become healthy due to the incorrect treatment. However, Dr. Hathaway's workload remains manageable, and she can continue to help other patients.

### Explanation of Actions:
- **Assess Ross**: This action is necessary to determine Ross's condition and decide on a treatment plan.
- **Treat Ross for Flaze**: This action is essential to attempt to make Ross healthy, even though it results in a mistake.
- **Admit Young to Patient Room B**: This action is necessary to ensure that Young can be assessed and treated next, maintaining the flow of care in the hospital.
